					<description><![CDATA[My one year anniversary is tomorrow. We went to Seattle for our honeymoon because of your blog. You have an amazing city. If Seattle were in Canada we would have moved in a heartbeat. My husband is a chef and even inquired after a job at that nice Italian place beside the market. Every time I read your blog I am taken back to a wonderful trip. Thank you! I can&#039;t wait to go back again and go to Delancey this time. Here&#039;s hoping I will be able to behave somewhat like an adult because I fan-girl a little at the thought of it :)]]></description>
