					<description><![CDATA[Just found your site via a member&#039;s post on Rancho Gordo Bean Club.  Those graham crackers look divine!  Alas they don&#039;t ship them because they break in transit, but they do ship cookies so I might have to try some.  Thank you for this recipe.  I am happy to have found your blog!]]></description>

I&#039;m waiting for my train now , enjoying graham crackers that I meticulously made and packed last night so I thought why not leave a comment  only to realise that the last comment was also mine !

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Molly. These are awesome graham crackers. They are so good I haven&#039;t brought any to work or church, or even to my mother. My husband and I are spending this week trying new combinations of homemade s&#039;more creations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brenda]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t Edison the cutest, most amazing little place? We somewhat accidentally discovered it too recently. Then Kyle and I were gushing about it to Ashley and Gabe only to learn her folks live there. Cookouts in Edison have been dreamed up since... and a brewery concept. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xx&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kacie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No way, I thought.  No way am I heading off to the health food store for turbinado and bran.  No way will&lt;br /&gt;I be taking these in and out of the freezer all day.  Plus, he won&#039;t even notice the difference between these and store-bought.  Made &#039;em anyway.  He ate the entire batch.  I got zero. Off I go to make &#039;em again. :)]]></description>
