					<description><![CDATA[Awesome stuff. I was only in Sitka once on Semester at Sea in the Spring of 2003, and ironically I ate pizza from a zip lock bag on a bench downtown. It was marvelous. Hitchhiked later in the day in the back of a rusted out truck to a kayak rental shop a few miles away and paddled around, checked out an awesome cove. Fantastic location, hopefully I can get back there some day. First blog post I have read and it is dynamite stuff:)&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on the new restaurant! Also, I highly recommend the whole Wright book The Brach Will Not Break. You may already know it, since A Blessing is from it. It is a thin little collection and has made a great traveling companion since college-- I still slip it in my bag from time to time. I loved the Hass poem-- I had not read it before, so thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;br /&gt;I think this is one of my favorite Orangette blog posts.  The kids must have been thrilled to have you family visit Sitka.  Such a treat for all of you!  Thanks for sharing your photos and experience.  &lt;br /&gt;Will have to make a trip to Seattle for an Orangette restaurant tour.  Best wishes on the new place!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed both your books and I think your blog aesthetics are beautiful.  Sorry to post a tangential question here - as I slowly make my way through your recipe index - do you have any favorite granola recipes that do not have nuts?  And any favorite cookie recipes that do not have eggs?  (Allergies.)  Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[re: Poetry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does poetry take you back to that person you were 20 years ago? I am not sure, but I think it has something to do with the fact that poetry is more similar to music than prose and I believe music is processed by a different part of the brain than everyday language. I am pretty sure (I&#039;d have to go back and look it up) that people with memory dysfunction can often remember songs from their childhood perfectly even though their minds have let go of many other things. &lt;br /&gt;&quot;The Blessing&quot; was one of my college poems too. Took me right back!]]></description>
