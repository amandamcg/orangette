					<description><![CDATA[Molly I am trying to find a zucchini recipe you referred to that a friend had made, and it converted you to a new way of making zucchini.  It is in thin slices, olive oil slicked, and cooked at very high heat in the oven and then has lots of basil on it.  Does this sound familiar?    You said it was from a friend - someone you had dinner with often when Brandon was working.  If you lead me to it I will be SO happy.  Thanks.  - Val W]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My rhubarb is getting out of control (I wonder if green rhubarb is more prolific than red?), so I decided to try this tonight. It was fantastic! Really good with strawberry ice cream (if you like strawberry and rhubarb together), and I&#039;m looking forward to having some with Greek yogurt tomorrow morning. I added the tiniest pinch of salt to the compote, which made the flavor pop a surprising amount (though not sure why I was surprised - salt in anything kind of does that). This recipe is so simple and so perfect. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love it in yogurt too! If you add granola and close your eyes, it&#039;s almost like pie but more breakfast-y.

					<description><![CDATA[Thank-you! What a recommendation: I am now desperately in love with the Pastry Department. I read the whole blog and will be working my way through the recipes/formulas. She is just what I need as a young inexperienced pastry chef, like a virtual mentor. Have you tried the sourdough crumpets? Genius. And those nutter butters!! I don&#039;t even know what the originals taste like but I WANT THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations on your award - you were one of my first food blogs, and a huge inspiration for me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for some rhubarb and fromage blanc. Delightful!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What memories: just before leaving my native Seattle in 2003 Eva was one of my very favorite restaurants to frequent (I lived at 43rd and 15th!). I&#039;ll never forget a dinner I had there with a group of my closest women friends shortly after my mom died; such a beautiful, intimate space with equally beautiful food. I fondly remember the desserts and am glad to know the pastry chef has gone onto further acclaim!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My first place was a flat at 42nd and Lincoln in San Francisco in the late &#039;80s. It had a back yard that we rarely used because in the fog-enshrouded Sunset district there&#039;s rarely a reason to go outside. One day a friend of my girlfriend&#039;s came up from Santa Cruz. She went exploring in the back yard, came back with what looked like red celery, and exclaimed to us that &lt;i&gt;we had rhubarb growing out there&lt;/i&gt;! I had heard of rhubarb but had never seen or eaten it. She proceeded to make a rhubarb pie that I remember to this day. At the time it seemed like a minor miracle that someone could take something from my urban back yard and turn it into food.]]></description>
