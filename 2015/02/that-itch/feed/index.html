					<description><![CDATA[oh I so know what you mean!!  An itch that needs to be scratched.  Loving the recipes.  I live in France and interestingly the French cooking magazines have little cut out slips with the names of the recipes on one side and the ingredients on the other.  They cant understand UK programs which dont give any detail at all.  They dont get that the Brits watch the cooking for entertainment and then buy the books.  Different horses, definitely]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rainy afternoon in early January found us driving down 405 &lt;br /&gt;with a pot of homemade chicken soup and a loaf of homemade French bread on our way to visit our friend in Issaquah who was recovering from surgery. As we sat  in her living room watching the rain dancing across her patio she said, go look in that basket&quot;.  There&#039;s a book in there I think you might like. It had me at the title, &quot;A Homemade Life&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I read it in 2 days and then reread it while waiting for &quot;Delancy&quot; to show up in my mailbox.  Ordered by my hubby. :)&lt;br /&gt;Then I read &quot;Delancy&quot; again.  We have a standing dinner date with friends the last Sat. of every month and we are bringing them to&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Delancy&quot; this Sat. eve. for pizza.  We planned this a month ago, but I couldn&#039;t wait a whole month so my hubby and I drove to Ballard on a Sat. night 3 weeks ago just to check it out.  We dined on Romana pizza, sipped red wine and wrapped up our meal with &quot;Apple Cake&quot;.  All I can say is YUM!  We ate at the bar (where all the action is) and quickly realized is the best seat in the house. At one point I recognized Brandon at the pizza oven and at another point the professional bike racer sitting next to me nudged me and said, if you look up now, you&#039;ll see Molly walking through the restaurant. That was the icing on the cake, so to speak. :) I read a lot and I have to say you are the most creative writer I have read.  What a gift!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for letting all of us readers see inside you life, in such an honest and real way!  my hubby is reading your books now.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#039;t wait for Sat. night to introduce our friends to&quot;Delancy&quot;. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had a few epic failures lately, too. Always makes me question if I was a good cook to begin with? But then I get back on the horse, because people need to be fed, and somehow, a good meal arises and all is well again.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love fennel (even though I don&#039;t like liquorice!).  My husband, however, does not. The best I can do is chop it finely and put it in pasta sauce or risotto.   ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;I have just now finished reading your book &quot;A Homemade Life&quot; and loved it and wanted to let you know.  I&#039;m living just north of Spokane now, but lived in Issaquah for 20 years, and have done a lot of traveling (nearly 70 countries so far, but so many more I want to see!).  As you feel about Paris, so I feel about Ireland. I lived there for a year and wish I could afford to spend half of each year there.  I also lived in London for 6 months, Ghana for 3 years and Japan for 10 years, so have tried a lot of different kinds of food over the years. I&#039;m not a &#039;natural&#039; cook in that I need a recipe to start anything.  I can change it a bit or add/delete things, but I always need someone else&#039;s creativity to begin. I have a collection of way over 8000 cookbooks (I stopped counting when I hit 8000) and love to sit down and read through them.  I&#039;m constantly trying new recipes--life is too short to keep eating the same thing over and over.  I&#039;m planning on keeping up with your blog from now on.  Thanks for a great read and a few recipes I really want to try!]]></description>
