					<description><![CDATA[Great seasoning combination! I had squash and onions but not most of the other ingredients so sauteed onions, added lots squash and apple chunks and double all the seasonings, plus vegetable stock (Better than Bouillon, not homemade), and made a fantastic pureed soup.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Longtime lurker popping by to say a very, very enthusiastic thank you for this recipe: it&#039;s easily my favourite thing that I&#039;ve made in two years (note that this is not saying much since I make the same things over and over again, BUT STILL). Furthermore, I don&#039;t know if I got the right kind of preserved lemons, but I&#039;ve discovered that Middle Eatern pickled lemons are basically the best thing ever. As is couscous with saffron. I&#039;m totally in love with this recipe and have made it twice in 3 weeks. THANK YOU! :)]]></description>

Rachel, I just looked into that, and whoa, this is really weird.  The squash shows up in the ingredients list when I&#039;m looking at the post in Wordpress, but it disappears once I publish the post.  Ugh! Bizarre.  I&#039;m working on fixing it.  In the meantime, what the ingredients list should say is this: 2 Â½ cups peeled, cubed pumpkin or butternut squash (from a 10-ounce / 285-gram squash).  Thanks for bringing it to my attention!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I might be not seeing it. There are 3 fussy kids in the other room but the ingredient list does not have squash on it and the instructions say add squash...I&quot;ll read it again but I&quot;m feeling a bit foolish.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, the recipes of Ottolenghi&#039;s that have become staples at our table! We have all his cookbooks and have recently considered getting rid of everything else, because we may never venture away from his recipes again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His Squash with Chile Yogurt and Cilantro Sauce from &quot;Plenty More&quot; is the EASIEST RECIPE EVER, it almost feels like cheating. (The chile yogurt is just Sriracha and Greek yogurt whisked together and it goes on most of our food now.) I also cannot speak more highly of his Turkey and Zucchini Burgers (from &quot;Jerusalem&quot;) and his Green Couscous (from &quot;Plenty&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is on dog-eared in my cookbook, so it&#039;ll have to make an appearance soon!]]></description>
