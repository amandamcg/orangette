					<description><![CDATA[Drank a mug of this hot chocolate (with a pinch of sea salt) while listening to a couple episodes of Spilled Milk. Just perfect! Although I almost spit out the HC laughing at the antics of you and The Hulk. You guys are too funny!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[June is soo soo soo adorable ! 

Her satisfied look urged me that I must try this recipe , and finally this morning I made it, soooooo good. I made 2 cups with 2 different unsweetened cocoa powder:

Hershey&#039;s + sugar 
Van Honten + sugar

And it came out that the one with Van Honten was smoother and the one with Hershey&#039;s was a bit sweeter. 

Makes me want to buy all different kinds of cocoa powder just to compare. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A little over nine years ago I was Christmas shopping with my boyfriend and spotted a tiny whisk, perfect for mixing up hot cocoa in a mug.  I had just recently given up the pre-mixed stuff and started making it your way.  He made fun of me for buying it, questioning how much I&#039;d actually use it.  I broke up with him a few months later, but I still use that whisk all the time.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this.  Also, as veteran hot cocoa maker, I would add: I really do recommend the water method that folks have referred to (and that appears on the container of Hershey cocoa - we can all agree that their cocoa is not the best, but they have nailed this recipe).  Water, as opposed to milk, really brings out the chocolate flavor.  Hence, Like Water for Chocolate.  Mix cocoa plus sugar, add just enough water to dissolve it, and heat until simmering and cocoa flavor explodes (like garlic in oil, kind of). Then add milk and proceed. This can all be done handily in the microwave.  I think a splash of vanilla at the end is not unwarranted.  Also, I think some salt kicks it all up--a generous pinch improves the flavor.  Just some thoughts--either way, June will have delicious cocoa and continue to be utterly adorable!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[She&#039;s so beautiful. I can&#039;t wait until my little one has enough hair for pigtails. Also, well done on the mug. I was always a really good student, but I barely scraped a B- in ceramics. ]]></description>
