					<description><![CDATA[I made these last week pretty much as written (with lemon juice instead of lime because it´s what I had and likewise with rhum instead of vodka) and they were absolutely delicious, like a punch of watermelon in the best possible way. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love your blog. Second, I love your books. The first book actually inspired a trip to Seattle. Anyways, I was wondering if you were an Alice Waters/Chez Panisse cookbook fan? If so, which one is best for the home cook. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muchas Gracias, &lt;br /&gt;Jess&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, those popsicles would sound (and look) great almost anytime, but especially while Seattle is enduring this uncharacteristic heat wave. You must have been especially popular with friends &amp; neighbors who knew what what was in your freezer. If I can find a recipe for frozen coconut pops that are as good as Dreyer&#039;s, I&#039;m going to have to invest in that mold.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The mold in the link is the same one that Molly has pictured (I have the same one)--the Amazon link just shows the blue plastic cover on top whereas Molly took a photo with out the lid. It is indeed metal underneath.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The top of the mold you use in the pictures looks a lot different than the one in the link. Yours looks like it&#039;s made of metal and really durable. Have they changed the product, or is it a personal refinement? I&#039;d love one like the mold pictured, so any input would be great! Thanks!]]></description>
