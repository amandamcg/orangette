					<description><![CDATA[This sounds like a great recipe.  I just bought a chicken, so I&#039;ll try it.  My husband loves mustard -- he will be thrilled!  I&#039;m so impressed that you are a food blogger and your stove top is from the 70s.  I think that it tells us all that it doesn&#039;t have to be the latest to be the greatest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I LOVE that you settled on the Zuni and TK recipes as the best roast chicken recipes.  My research led me to these two recipes too.  I&#039;ve created a hybrid of both of them. I couldn&#039;t roast a chicken to save my life before.   I salt and pepper the chicken and place it breast down in the fridge and tented with plastic at least 24 hours in advance, sometimes up to 3 days in advance. (It can be a pain, but the day you roast it, you are so glad that you did.) Pat it dry and put it back in the fridge uncovered the day of roasting until about an hour before and then take it out of the fridge.  Pre-heat the oven to 500.  Put the well-dried chicken breast side down in a cast iron skillet. Since I have convect roast as an option, I use that feature and reduce the heat to 475.  I do not turn the chicken. It cooks breast side down the whole time.  (My Greek grandmother always cooked her bird breast down, insisting that the fat dripping through the body kept the breast meat moist.) Depending on size, a small chicken will be done in 50-60 minutes, a larger one will take a bit longer.  When it comes out, I tent it with foil on a plate.  Make a pan sauce by removing most of the fat, deglazing it fresh lemon juice, add about a tablespoon of Dijon and then with the heat off by adding about 2 tablespoons of butter. Be careful the skillet will still be HOT from the oven.  Place the cut up chicken on a pile of fresh greens and pour the sauce over, mostly on the breast and greens.  So easy and delish!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this! This recipe has been one of our standbys for several years, and we can rarely bring ourselves to make it any other way. This one is just so simple and so perfect every time. I always eat it with an obscene amount of Dijon. A  few cornichons on the side are nice, too. My very first blog post was on this topic... it is a horrible post with bad pictures, bad writing, and no actual directions or recipe! (Just a link to epicurious.) haha. But hey, at least I picked a good recipe. :) http://labonvivante.blogspot.com/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went and made a chicken promptly after reading this post. I snacked too much while making it, so I turned the cooked chicken into pesto chicken salad and chicken noodle soup! YUM!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOVE that you referenced Best In Show. I need to watch that again.. and again.. I roast a chicken almost every week (when it&#039;s not 100 degrees out), although I did grill one tonight. I&#039;m going to give this recipe a try. It does seem almost too easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kacie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Liz, I&#039;m sorry for this slow reply!  (Currently on jury duty!) I&#039;ll bet your husband would love it if you cooked a 4- or 5-pound bird: he&#039;d have leftovers to enjoy.  But if you want to cook the chicken in pieces, you could certainly do it, yes.  It&#039;ll take much less time, though.  I&#039;d do legs if your husband likes them, because they&#039;re juicier and easier to cook well, but you could do half breasts and half legs if he likes to have white meat, too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wanted to surprise my husband by making him some roasted chicken, but I&#039;m a vegetarian, so I need to do this in a single-serving-with-leftovers kind of way. The smallest birds I can find are about 4-5 lbs and, I think, are far too much bird for one person to enjoy. Do you think this could be accomplished with assorted chicken pieces? I noticed at the meat counter that I can buy the legs and/or wings of a chicken, etc. My guess is that the cooking time would be shortened. Thoughts? And, if you think this is possible, which chicken parts would you choose to use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!  ]]></description>
