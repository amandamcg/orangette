					<description><![CDATA[Love love love this Yotam recipe.&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to say that tahini doesn&#039;t last long around my place, mostly because it ends up in my daily porridge! I recommend porridge + tahini, miso, and honey, if you want to go whole hog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A friend of a friend just reminded me about your blog when I was raving about my new favorite cookbook, &lt;i&gt;Plenty More&lt;/i&gt;.  I was told about it a couple of months ago by a chef friend of mine, got it a week or two later and have already made a dozen things in the book - the carrots twice.  I can second the recommendation of the mung been salad...and if it&#039;s not too late to find rhubarb, the beet and rhubarb salad was very good too.  Thanks for your blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am so glad to be among others who store tahini the same way! Having recently discovered Yotam Ottolenghi&#039;s cooking, I can&#039;t wait to try this recipe - it looks delicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, may I say how delighted I was to see the fork in your post? It&#039;s a bit odd, but hear me out. On the cover of the Feburary 1994 issue of Better Homes &amp; Gardens was a picture of a multi-layer white chocolate raspberry cake, and sitting next to the plate was this beautiful fork. I fell in love with this pattern and acutally wrote to the magazine asking for details. Fast forward seven years (yes, I kept the cover picture for &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; years!), and I happened to come across a book about silverplate patterns - and I found the exact same pattern! It&#039;s called &quot;Newport&quot;, originally by Rogers &amp; Bros. from 1847, and I began collecting pieces! My favorite is an incredible, wicked looking knife called a cake saw! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I apologize if this comment goes through twice!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Having just recently discovered Yotam Ottolenghi&#039;s cooking, I can&#039;t wait to make this! It looks delicious, and I&#039;m so glad to be in company with another cook who saves tahini the same way! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, may I just say I was thrilled to see your fork? It sounds weird, but hear me out. On the cover of the February 1994 issue of Better Homes &amp; Gardens, there was a picture of a 7-layer white chocolate raspberry cake, and sitting next to the plate was this beautiful fork. I wrote to the magazine asking for details, but they had no idea of the pattern or manufacturer. Fast forward 7 years (yes, I saved the cover picture for 7 years!)...I went into my local library in San Leandro, CA, just to see how it looked after a major earthquake retrofit, and I found a book on silverplate patterns. Lo and behold, that fork pattern was inside! It&#039;s called &quot;Newport&quot; by Rogers &amp; Bros. from 1847, and I have several pieces of this pattern, my favorite being this incredible, wicked looking knife called a cake saw!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I keep meaning to come back to tell you I&#039;ve made this three times! It is SO good. Even the pickiest among us (ahem) will eat it, and the littlest ADORES the tahini yogurt sauce - for her the carrots (or sweet potatoes - they&#039;re excellent in this as well) are really just a sauce collection device.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made the Roasted Carrots recipe, but altered your recipe Molly (sorry) to be dairy free. I made the recipe as directed. I also made the Tahini sauce as directed, but instead of the yogurt, I splashed in some plain almond milk until it had the consistency that I liked. And voila, dairy free sauce. My wife and I both agreed it was delicious.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Made this last night with seared chicken thighs thrown on top half way through baking.  To season the thighs I just threw them in the bowl that the carrots were prepped in and sprinkled them with more cumin, coriander, s&amp;P.  So. Good.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I should buy Ottolenghi&#039;s cookbooks, since every recipe I&#039;ve made of his is pure gold...I will, I will (as soon as I get my new kitchen with a cookbook shelf over the sink window..sigh)...I imagine you could just start from the very beginning and make every single recipe one after the next and never be disappointed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made the mung bean recipe this week, and as many have noted, it is quite delicious. He also had two sprouted salad recipes in Plenty More, which could help you get rid of more mung beans. :) The entire book is fantastic....I like everything I have made out of it thus far. The salads are standouts, I think. Two to definitely try: the pea, beet, and avocado (especially now while fresh peas are in season) and the roasted red onion one. I could eat them both for breakfast, lunch, and dinner....and have!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this last night and it was incredible! As per your suggestion I also roasted some red onions and chickpeas (tossed with a little paprika and olive oil) in a separate pan, and alongside some grilled lamb and rocket it was one of the best dinners we&#039;ve had in a long time. ]]></description>
