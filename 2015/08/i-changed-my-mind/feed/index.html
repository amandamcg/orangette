					<description><![CDATA[Very elegantly written M. I strongly believe the more prosaic lettuces will again have their day in the sun and especially Iceberg lettuce. For me, James Villas&#039; essay on the Iceberg lettuce kick started a whole thought and culinary process that led to my re-appreciation and re-invigorated use of it in my kitchen, from classic burger dressing to more unusual Chinese recipes using it. 

I wrote about it a while ago and spoke to some well known British food writers and cooks. The link to the piece is below if anyone would like to read it.

					<description><![CDATA[I absolutely love reading you! Now I know why the James Beard Foundation feels that way too... since I discovered you some months ago, you never disappoint! Love the dressing recipes too.. I&#039;m more of a sticking-to-traditions type of person when there&#039;s no reason to improve upon the original, so the raw egg is more appealing, but it&#039;s great to know one has alternatives (although in my home, my mayonnaise is homemade, which translates to yet more raw eggs...)
