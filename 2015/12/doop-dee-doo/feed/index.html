					<description><![CDATA[This is my third time making this soup. I love it. I&#039;ve been cutting the carrots and zucchini into 4&quot; chunks for cooking and then cutting them down, spoon-sized at the end. Soup cures a multitude of hurt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Contemplating your soup and wondering what would happen if I introduced a lime and cut avocado at serving.  I suspect I would be in gross violation of kitchen rules is I did not try the deviation!

Enjoying this newly found blog, wish I could stop by Essex for a drink but I&#039;m in Atlanta.]]></description>

I had to resist the urge for spice too, and I&#039;m glad I did because I think it&#039;s great the way it is. One of the best things I&#039;ve cooked for ages.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So genius! Added in a couple jalapenos, leeks, no mint, and extra zucchini. Squeezed lime on at the end. It was comforting, spicy, and punchy. Definitely the perfect remedy for clearing up your sinuses during this frigid, west coast winter!]]></description>
