					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly, long-time reader, listener (Hi, Matthew!), and general warm-hearted lurker here. First time commenting. My father died last week, and one of those good things that often come out of bad, I think, is that I feel like I need to stop lurking and start speaking. I am here to say congratulations, then, to you and the family, this place looks EXCELLENT. I love the vibe!! This fall my work conference will be in Seattle and I will be bringing my husband and kid (Seamus will be three in April, #toddlerlife, amiright?). We will hit up Delancey or Dino&#039;s for sure. Maybe both. Who knows? Life is short. Thanks for all your work, Molly. You are the best. Robin]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As I was reading this post some math happened in my head. I started reading your words and making your food when I was 15 years old - and I&#039;m now a day away from turning 28. 

I started breathing heavy - thinking about everything that&#039;s happened in both your life and mine since I first booked-marked your blog. I swiveled around in my chair to stare gravely at my boyfriend Kevin (visiting from Colorado to help me move my surprisingly car-sized life to Orcas Island - and to be my boyfriend) and asked if we could have pizza at Delancy. 

I had never been, having grown up in California, and it felt somehow so close (because yea) and so right (because I don&#039;t know?) 

It was perfect. It was. Kevin has pizza once a week (sometimes twice - possibly even three times and I just don&#039;t know) and mumbled with cheese dangling from his lips that &quot;this is the best pizza that I have ever had.&quot; I tried to swallow my sip of negroni without choking on the smile I was pouring into the glass.

I&#039;m not really sure what it was I wanted to - or what it is that I could say - the feeling is I think too big with too many names. It tastes an awful lot like love, even if &quot; thank you for existing.&quot; is all that comes out. So - thank you for existing, Molly.

Oh yes, the new layout feels like home.

The thought of your book chat makes me very happy, Bobbie!  Re: Ghiradelli chips, yes, you can use them. And as for a bourbon I recommend, how about Buffalo Trace, or Four Roses, or Woodford Reserve?]]></description>

Thanks for letting me know, Carla!  I spoke with my developer about it.  He fixed the header image, but there are other things that are still weird on iOS 5, which is what you are likely using. Are you able to update your iOS? It&#039;s free and should be fairly simple. The web browser that came with iPads a few years ago didn’t support many technologies that current-day websites are built with, and reworking this site to support older software would likely be very expensive for me and would degrade the experience for people using newer software. Thanks so much for understanding.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly, 

I am starting up my book chat at my home again and I picked your book for our event at the end of the month.  I called it &#039;Read, Cook, Chat &#038; Sip&#039;  and the 11 slots filled up in about an hour.  Others wanted to participate too so another member is hosting the same event at her home the following evening!  When looking at your chocolate cake recipe you mentioned 1 ounce of chocolate chopped.  Is there a reason why I shouldn&#039;t use Ghiradelli chocolate chips instead and skipping the chopping?  I noticed that one of your recipes called for whiskey and you suggested one in particular.  Now the pear caramel cake sounds equally amazing , what brandy or bourbon would you suggest?  Will take some pics of all the wonderful dishes coming into my home at the end of the month, thanks!

Happy New Year,
Bobbie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can the designers find a way to make the site workable again for those of us with older devices?  I have a 5-year-old iPad 2, on which the old Orangette site worked perfectly.  Now, however, the &quot;front page&quot; photo of the windows is distorted vertically, requiring 73 (I counted) screen swipes to get through, before arriving at the first blog post.   I tried clicking on the Recipes and Archive links at the bottom of the page (I seem not to have the sidebar you&#039;ve referred to) but both pages come up blank, apart from the windows photo and your photo.   I hope there&#039;s a fix for this, as for me, sadly, the new design means frustration and lack of usability.]]></description>
