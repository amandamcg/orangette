					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://orangette.net/2015/12/december-10/#comment-44446&quot;&gt;Katie&lt;/a&gt;.

At my grandmother&#039;s we only ever used cloth napkins with silver (plate) napkin rings, even for the most modest meal. So, we have collected vintage and antique figural napkin rings for each member of the family which we use at virtually every meal. Paper products only make an appearance on spaghetti night. Guests love being able to choose from our extras for use during their stay.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, this I&#039;m making multiple batches of your granola for my neighbors. I did it last year too--they raved about it--it is very good! It has to be the combination of the olive oil and maple syrup. I don&#039;t know, but it&#039;s delicious! Thank you and happy holidays. I love the new site--looking up recipes is a cinch!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly

I&#039;ve been a fan for about 10 years (time flies!) and bought your book, A Homemade life, right after reading your blog. Tried writing one but I&#039;ve found it hard to keep up and keep going. Great job out there! Would love to visit Delancey when I get to Seattle.

					<description><![CDATA[Been a fan of yours for some time, love the blog and your books.  Finally had an opportunity to eat at Delancey over the Thanksgiving weekend with my son, DIL and grandkids and lo and behold I got to meet you in person!!  What a special treat that was.  I bought a gift card for my adult granddaughter and her BF for Christmas and I&#039;ve just ordered the great looking Delancey tote.  Christmas present to myself.  Thanks so much for this wonderful blog.  I look forward to reading all the wonderful stories, recipes and inspirations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am such a sucker for the mice in tins.  Couldn&#039;t help but want to share this: https://www.etsy.com/listing/92689817/wee-mouse-tin-house-pdf-pattern?ref=shop_home_active_3 because you&#039;re in to sewing now too.  : )
My daughter is 9 months old so we are a little young this year but I probably start anyway because my son is six, so I know how time FLIES.  Thank you for all the recipes that have become staples in our house (waffles and granola most of all). I love everything about your blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly! I have been reading your blog and books for years now and happily procrastinating from research by cooking from your recipes. I am also in the middle of my PhD. As dropping out of said PhD program to start a food blog is a path already taken (ahem), I have settled on writing about food blogs as part of my research. I would like to ask your permission (formally) to include a few screen shots of the blog in an article for publication in an academic journal (meep! but a girl&#039;s gotta go for it at some point). What is the best way to contact you so I can explain more about what I want to do and you can see what you think? Thank you!]]></description>

Catherine, I think I took that shot right here in Seattle, looking out on Puget Sound.  Maybe from Sunset Hill Park?]]></description>

Katie, we don&#039;t have any hard-and-fast strategy around the cloth napkins, but mostly, yep, we each use one for a few days (or until it looks gross) and then toss it in the laundry. I haven&#039;t ever soaked them, even with really sticky stuff like egg yolk or potentially staining things like tomato sauce, though a stain remover like Oxy-Clean is a big help.]]></description>
