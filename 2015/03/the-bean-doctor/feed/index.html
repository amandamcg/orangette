					<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to let you know that I started making your seven minute egg for my six year old daughter. She is obsessed. She ate three for lunch the other day (one was supposed to be mine). She cried hard the other morning because she dropped her egg and the bus came before I could make another (I have since started making several in advance).  Basically, she&#039;s going to turn into a giant egg.  But, she&#039;s happy, and she&#039;s eating something that&#039;s not sugar (her other obsession).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love these beans, but since I got an Instant Pot I&#039;m kind of into dried beans these days. Is there a good modification for cooked, but not canned, beans? Plain water instead of juice from the can?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I know this post is several years but I just made yet another batch of these and wanted to come and thank you, because I make a version of these once a week. It&#039;s a reliable and endlessly adaptable back pocket recipe and I am so glad for this, and so many of the other great recipes of yours over the years that have turned into regulars in my kitchen. Thank you thank you thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I just wanted to thank you for this recipe. I read it when you first posted and kept thinking about it from time time, then tried it for the first time tonight with the eggs and some sauteed greens from our garden.  I have three kids and they all went bonkers and kept asking &quot;What did you do to these beans? They are soooo good!&quot; It&#039;s a keeper.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this recipe, Molly - delicious! - and a big thank you as well to all who shared their own versions. Since struggling to become a vegan (for health reasons), I have come to love &quot;doctored beans&quot; and am always looking for new recipe ideas. 
   And in the spirit of sharing, here is a favorite quickie bean soup recipe of my own: a can of unflavored re-fried black beans (or pintos), preferably unsalted, with enough of approx equal parts Swanson&#039;s Mexican Tortilla-flavored broth &#038; milk (I use soy) to make creamy (I usually use half an empty bean can of each). Stir well, heat, add some optional cumin &#038;/or garlic powder (I usually omit if in a hurry), then serve with opt spoonful of salsa, crushed tortilla chips and/or chopped avocado. Mmmm.]]></description>
