					<description><![CDATA[Vacationing in the outer banks with nothing to read, I found The Final Solution by Chabon on the coffee table of the rental we stayed in and it blew me away. Very short, quick read but wow!That man can weave a fantastic tale &amp; completely transport you. Kavalier &amp; Clay is on my list next! LOVE your blog so much...&lt;br /&gt; ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read the discussion of food magazines you linked to. The comments made me feel rather naive.  I don&#039;t feel that way, but maybe I haven&#039;t been paying close enough attention.  I do miss Gourmet of course. But I also love Saveur (I still remember the photos and descriptions from a Cuba article they did many years ago,) and I do derive inspiration from Bon Appetit. I wrote to BA some months ago telling them I wished they would be more plant-centric, and less-meat-focused, in light of what we know about the environment and the resources that meat necessitates, in additon to the health benefits conferred by consuming a more plant-based diet.  But I do think it&#039;s an appealing and readable magazine, and I find that their recipes in general really work. And as long as that holds true, I don&#039;t care how many chambray shirts they&#039;re wearing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to boast that Michael Chabon and I are twins: we share May 24, 1963 as our birthday! How cool is that?   I have read and loved &quot;Summertime,&quot; &quot;K. and Clay,&quot; and &quot;Telegraph Avenue,&quot; but you&#039;ve reminded me to check out his others. Thanks!  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re really interested in Wonder Boys: the movie is totally different, and I actually like it better than the book. Also, Chuck Kinder is the basis for Grady, so you might want to read something by him. The last book I read of his, actually mentioned double dickle on the rocks. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read (and loved!) Kavalier and Clay this fall. And I was thinking about downloading the audiobook version of another of his books, but now I&#039;m having second thoughts, having been reminded of the elegance of his writing. Listening alone probably wouldn&#039;t do it justice.]]></description>
