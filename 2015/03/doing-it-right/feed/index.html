Forgot to mention that I used fresh raspberries, for those wondering if that&#039;s OK: a big yes! We used berries we had picked ourselves, that were on their way out and breaking down a bit -- and still the cake was blissful!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This cake is unbelievably good. Even my picky boyfriend, who doesn&#039;t usually like fruit-filled cakes (Inconceivable!), raved about this one. Made as written, with one extra flourish of my own that I highly recommend: I sprinkled the top with raw turbinado sugar before baking to get a crackly, sweet lid. The crunchy top meeting the moist middle and fragrant raspberries is a stellar combination.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to make a slightly off-topic comment; you mentioned your recipe for Homemade Ricotta in Delancey, and I LOVE that recipe so much!  I tried it side by side with two other ricotta recipes, and yours was my favorite.  It might be the cream :)  Definitely the buttermilk gives it a wonderful flavor.  Any homemade ricotta is yummy, but yours was especially good.  Thank-you for sharing the recipe!]]></description>

I&#039;ve made this cake many times now.  It has a wonderful soft texture and a great balance of flavors.  I reduce the sugar to three quarters of a cup and increase the fruit.  It&#039;s wonderful we sour cherries and it&#039;s wonderful with sour cherries and raspberries together.  I am going to make it for Christmas ,  that&#039;s how much we love it.  Oh, and it doesn&#039;t hurt that it&#039;s easy to make !]]></description>

Molly! I love you almost as much as I love this cake. My best friend and I have made it countless times with different types of ricotta and it always takes more than 75 minutes to bake. We live in Houston, so defitely not an altitude issue. In fact, just baked it tonight for thanksgiving and came over to comment on the timeing. 

Peace, love, and cake all day every day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just made a gluten-free version of this using Cup4Cup flour (although I weighed everything) and fresh raspberries.  Absolutely delicious - thanks for the recipe; it&#039;s a keeper!]]></description>
