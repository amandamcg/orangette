					<description><![CDATA[Love Lucky Peach so much : )  And I cannot think of Sitka now (haven&#039;t been - yet) without needing to rewatch one of my favorite guilty pleasure chick flicks:  The Proposal.  Great plane movie if you&#039;re in the mood for light humor!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I have been reading your blog since 2005 - that&#039;s 10 years! I feel I should celebrate with some of my favourite dishes from you. But that&#039;s not what I came to the comments for: I just wanted to say that your writing and storytelling are what keep me coming back, not just the food. So I am delighted you are among the finalists, I cannot think of a better food blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, you&#039;ll love Alaska! And you&#039;ll find amazing food no matter where you end up (Homer, we love you!), except for the one native village&#039;s &quot;Bed &amp; Breakfast&quot; that serves fresh salmon eggs (fiiiissssshy!) on crackers for an evening snack and warm boxed milk and tiny boxes of cold cereal for breakfast (my husband &amp; I spent our first ten years together in AK - he was a bush pilot who, on that particular day, got weathered in to a native village and had to spend the night)!! Yum.&lt;br /&gt;Congrats on your nomination!! Of course you&#039;re the best writer. ]]></description>
