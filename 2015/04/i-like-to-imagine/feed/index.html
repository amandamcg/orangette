					<description><![CDATA[Since having a baby, scones- and matcha lattes- have been the object of my craving! I live in Ballard, too, and have taken it upon myself to sample all the neighborhood varieties. My favorite so far is from Tall Grass, and these have the same texture and flavor that I love! I think it&#039;s the blend of all-purpose and wheat flours that make for such a pleasing taste. I&#039;ve been meaning to make these since you talked about them on Spilled Milk - the date episode, I think- and literally have announced every day for the last month that I will make scones. Today, the babe was (relatively) content to sit in the kitchen and watch as I whipped up the batter. My disc made 8 scones, of which two are already gone! Delicious.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this book. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever made a single recipe from it, but it was the book I gave Jacob for his birthday a week before he asked me out on our first date. So, now we have two copies, which are slightly different shades of green. I think I felt like it was one of the first cookbooks that treated photography with respect for the place that food was being made, and not just about the food that was being created.
