					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, 
Just wanted to drop a note to say I made some grocery store dried cannellini this way on Friday and I cannot tell you how delicious they are.  I soaked them overnight and then cooked them in the oven.  They were done quicker than the recipe which was great.  The first night I ate them plain in their broth - WOW - and today I added some chopped tomatoes and greens.  SOOOOO good.  Thank you.  
 I have tried many of your fantastic recipes and they have become staples around here: banana bread, granola, minced beef with basil, apple cake etc. etc.  I love your writing and recommendations for reading and eating.  You are such a gift.  

Thanks again - Susan]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had to cook mine (white beans from the whole foods bulk section) about 2 hours longer, and they still weren&#039;t perfect.  However, I was starving, so I went ahead and followed the recipe for braising them with escarole, which was just enough to turn them into the best beans I have ever had.  I&#039;m going to try soaking them for less than 24 hours next time though, and if that doesn&#039;t work I might start experimenting with the slow cooker because 6 hours in the stove is not something I want to do for beans all the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, Thanks for sharing this recipe and your take on it as well. I haven&#039;t cooked beans in a very long time that didn&#039;t come out of a can so discovering this wonderful recipe was a boon! My boyfriend who is leery of beans fell in LOVE with beans the night I pulled the pot out of the oven and had him try a little bowl. We proceeded to eat them with breakfast with over-easy eggs on top and then as part of a warm green salad. Next up is navy beans! I was wondering do you have a supplier here in Seattle for large white beans?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cassie, I love beans from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ranchogordo.com/collections/heirloom-beans&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Rancho Gordo&lt;/a&gt;, if you&#039;re willing to do mail-order.  If not, does your local grocery store have a good bulk section that gets a decent amount of traffic? If so, I&#039;ll bet their beans are replenished pretty frequently...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, thanks for the quick response! It is frustrating! But, now that you mention it, I was using beans that had been in my cupboard for awhile. I was attempting to clear out my cupboards and use what I already had on hand. I will have to try the recipe again with freshly purchased beans. Do have a recommendation for a brand or place to purchase beans?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cassie, that&#039;s so strange - and immensely frustrating, I know! Can I ask where you&#039;re buying your beans? The only beans I&#039;ve had fail to cook are beans that are old and have sat around for too long. Are you buying them from a place that has a lot of turnover, so the beans are freshly stocked?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Am I the only person this recipe didn&#039;t work for? I have tried several times to cook dried beans and each time with no success. I thought maybe this recipe might be &#034;the one.&#034; Unfortunately, despite soaking for 24 hrs and cooking in the oven for almost 8 hours, my beans remained hard and crunchy. What do dried beans have against me?? Any suggestions?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These were great! Thanks for the recommendation. I made the Rancho Gordo Red Eye variety and they cooked perfectly. Eventually.... I would recommend upping the oven temp for those of you who live above 5,000 feet. I added two hours to the cooking time instead, but I was lucky to have the extra time for it. Next round, I&#039;ll see if 225º or even 250º won&#039;t help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We eat beans all the time. We use Camellia brand. I don&#039;t soak and I&#039;ll either simmer them on the stove all day (if it&#039;s a weekend) or stick them in the crock pot before I leave for work in the morning. My husband soaks his when he cooks and uses the pressure cooker. It&#039;s one of the first dishes my kids were taught how to cook. Red bean Monday!]]></description>
