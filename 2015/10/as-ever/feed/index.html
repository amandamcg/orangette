					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I misread your instructions and used a full cup of melted coconut oil! I realized the texture was funny and that‚Äôs when I saw my error. Should I rebake or risk taking this to the party I‚Äôm baking this for? I can‚Äôt try it before serving. :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I  made this following the recipe  pretty exactly and it was absolutely delicious. I devoured it within three days allowing my husband only about a quarter. I&#039;m curious though, I only used 2/3 of the icing. Are you really supposed to just pour it all over the top?   That seems like an awful lot.

By the way, the sliced almonds suggestion also sounds yummy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this recipe, but last time I made it it came out a bit underdone, and I remembered, faintly, that it took significantly longer to bake.  Tonight it took forever--70 minutes, and that was with turning the heat up to 375 at 45 minutes and then up to 400 at 65 minutes because OMG COOK.  It was in a glass loaf pan, to be fair, but still.  My oven is not new?  Is that the problem?  Anyway, then of course I let the glaze get a little too hot, and when things finalllllllly cooked I had to pull it out and run off to choir.  I just chipped it out of the loaf pan (so this is why I should&#039;ve used parchment paper!  ...it wasn&#039;t actually that bad...) and the inside is perfection.  I&#039;ll just leave it at that.  And note that in future, plan on super long baking times to enjoy this amazing recipe.]]></description>

Your grandmother was a genius!  Stunningly obvious now that you explained it, but it never would have occurred to me. I made peanut butter cookies yesterday by computing the weight of the two cups of PB called for in the recipe, but the displacing water technique is even easier.]]></description>

I worry that buttermilk might have too much liquid - it&#039;s a lot &lt;i&gt;wetter&lt;/i&gt; than yogurt - but it&#039;s worth a try. Let me know if you give it a go!]]></description>
