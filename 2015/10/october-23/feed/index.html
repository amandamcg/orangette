					<description><![CDATA[I know you guys remodeled the kitchen a bit ago now, but posting here to say &#034;I feel you.&#034;  Not long before I left for college my family would wake up every morning to a giant puddle of water on the kitchen floor (which at the time, was linoleum with may spots that had peeled away).  For a long time, we thought the fridge was leaking every night.  I always thought it was both funny and sad, since that fridge was installed when I was a toddler and had character - it was outdated, but black and white and familiar - so it was like a dear older family member who became incontinent.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fridge was eventually replaced, tear! - but the nightly leakage wasn&#039;t actually the fridge&#039;s fault.  It was the dishwasher, whose filters were clogged. When my parents finally remodeled, they peeled away the floor to find that the sub-floor had rotted through, as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, remodeling is the pits.  Glad you had friends to help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, love your blog and your books, too. The George Saunders piece was wonderful -- so heartfelt and honest. One main point is something I believe to be true in all aspects of life rather than writing only: generosity of spirit. Being kind, and going the extra mile for someone -- especially someone struggling -- is the key to being a good person. Generosity of spirit is just that: sharing what you have, whether material or spiritual. I heard Tobias Wolff speak once and he was just as Saunders describes in his talk. And I highly recommend &#034;This Boy&#039;s Life: A Memoir&#034; by Wolff if you&#039;ve never read it. Now I&#039;ll have to start reading Saunders. I&#039;d never heard of him before, and you obviously have great taste in writing as well as food. My brother lives in Seattle, and I hope to eat at Delancey someday when I&#039;ve visiting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ODD DUCK by Cecil Castellucci and Sara Varon is an awesome book for explaining &#034;weird&#034; to kids.  Weird is just different than the norm.  The book fits the description, too, as a graphic novel/picture book hybrid.  The art is adorable, too!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Odd-Duck-Cecil-Castellucci/dp/1596435577]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All I have to say is: Love REM, love Alison Bechdel so so so much (Did you read her follow-up to Fun Home?), LOVE Richard Scarry (TEddy&#039;s favorite book is the exact Scarry number that my brother and I loved as a kid.), and lastly, On Being is THE BEST, though I have to be in the right mood for it, like reading poetry. Oh and thank you for reading my last post!! xox]]></description>
