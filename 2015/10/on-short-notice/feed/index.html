					<description><![CDATA[Hi there!
I&#039;m new to your blog, and I like what I see! I&#039;m always looking for something new to make, and you&#039;ve given me a lot to work with. As a &quot;little old lady with crepey elbows in a house dress &quot;, this looked right up my alley, and it WAS delicious. Even my wanna be carnivore husband gave it a thumbs up.  Adoro i fagoli! Thanks!

My parents are Italian and this is a staple in our family.
Being a peasant dish, there&#039;s all sorts of variations - my mum always complains that cannellini beans aren&#039;t the proper bean to use, but realistically, just about any white bean will do.
It&#039;s perfect comfort food.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,  I just read Delancey in a day and am now obsessed.  I am anxious to try the braised escarole and white beans but the recipe says &quot;a batch of white beans.&quot;  What do you consider a batch?  What quantity of dried beans am I preparing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We like beans well enough, but we truly LOVED this dish.  The beans by themselves are the best we&#039;ve ever had and can&#039;t wait to have them again.  This was comforting and satisfying  yet offered quiet sophistication.  And... The perfect post holiday antidote to days of over indulging.  It was sumptuous to hit a spoonful tart with lemon juice and the nest spoonful with rich olive oil.  My husband is a committed omnivore, but feasting on this dish had him pondering an alternative vegetarian diet - if only for a day<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these with &#034;haricots lingots&#034; (I bought them at the market in the French town where I&#039;m living.) I cheated a little bit on the recipe--I worried I hadn&#039;t washed my beans enough before soaking, because my soaking water looked a little dirty. So, I used a coeur bouillon cube that I had that was lemon and herb flavored to make the base bean recipe. I used those beans to make this tonight and oh my god...these beans were LIFE CHANGING. Seriously. They were so so good. it was incredible. Hurray!!!! And because dried beans are soooo cheap and soooooo compact I have enough left to make them again! Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This looks like perfect comfort food to me. Warm and rich but won&#039;t leave you feeling like you swallowed a 10-ton truck when you&#039;re done eating it. Lovely writing, as always. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You know. I&#039;ve never been a big fan of REM. Perhaps I was too young or my friends never really went through an REM phase, but even so after reading this,l I found myself jamming out in my cubicle to REM. Thank you as always for this lovely portrait that I think we can all connect with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pictures today are absolutely gorgeous; the lighting amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always happy to read your wonderful posts. :)]]></description>
