My standard loaf pan is about 9x5 inches, and the minis are 3x6 inches. I don&#039;t recall how full I made them; sorry! I eyeballed it.]]></description>

What are dimensions on the standard and mini loaf pans you used? How full did you fill each? Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the recipe! The cake was nice and moist and the frosting was outstanding.  I think that from now on I will use this frosting on other cakes such as carrot and pumpkin. 

I went ahead and tried to make your Aunt Bill&#039;s candy.  My candy thermometer was not quite right and I overcooked the batch.  After it was poured and set up, I ended up with close to 2 pounds of toffee with pecans.  Happy mistake once the harden candy was broken up!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I served this at a dinner party last night - with store-bought applesauce - and it was a huge hit! Like Nancy, I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. My friends couldn&#039;t stop talking about how great it was. Thanks for this winning recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful!  When in Mexico helping cook for a deaf school, she had an apple/peeler/corer/slicer and donated apples.  We fixed the apples to dry, chopped the peels and put them in a pot with water, sugar &#038; cinnamon. Boiled until soft, drained the liquid for syrup and used the chopped peels for apple crisp. No one could tell it was made with peels.  When making applesauce last year, I boiled the peels and then put them through the blender and froze bags for cooking.  I used a bag for the cake &#038; it worked great!  I also didn&#039;t have heavy cream so substituted canned evaporated milk.  Served it at a potluck and they only left a couple of pieces, sigh.  Thank  you for the stupendous recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The health food nut in me subbed 1/2 c whole wheat flour and reduced the white sugar by 1/2 cup.  I can&#039;t help it, I was raised by hippies.  The cake was still perfectly sweet, light and soft and delicate and devoured by all.  My fussy son now too wants it for his birthday cake!]]></description>
