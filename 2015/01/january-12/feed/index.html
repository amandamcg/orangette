					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m clearly behind on my blog reading as I&#039;m just commenting now. How did it jump from &quot;Jan 12&quot; to the middle of March already?? I&#039;d love to visit Oaxaca sometime. My sis lived there for almost a year and loved it. We have the most giant sturgeon in the Columbia River Gorge... much bigger than 8 feet and there are guessed to be as many as 2,000,000 in the river. I paddleboard and wade in the shallows. ;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kacie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loved reading about your vacation.  Can&#039;t wait to see more pictures! All the Light You Cannot See my favorite book of 2014.  Also loved Anatomy of a Misfit by Portes and these two that I read this year, but came out a few years ago: The Dog Stars/ Heller and Tiny Beautiful Things/Strayed.  Love your blog and books, planning on Ed Fretwell soup this week!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Was just thinking about using a film camera the other day, but we finally gave our film cameras away a year or so ago. Hadn&#039;t used them in several years, but it seems a lifetime ago. Glad you were able to relax, but I don&#039;t think I could have relaxed with tarantulas around! shudder]]></description>
