					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly. That&#039;s our house, Casa Sol a Sol, that you stayed at in Estacahuite!

So glad you enjoyed your stay! 

The people that are staying there now read about it on your blog...this is their second time there!

We&#039;re not good about planning ahead, so I&#039;m writing this while sitting on a different Oaxacan beach, where we came to stay while the house is occupied. Can&#039;t wait to get back there!

Our lovely renters had us over for breakfast a couple of days ago. It&#039;s so much fun to see what other people do there...a different experience for everyone!

Come on back any time!

					<description><![CDATA[It was wonderful reading about the land where many of my dear friends call home and hope to return to someday. They are the people who work in the fields picking most of the fruits and vegetables we eat.  They remain in the shadows, for the most part, almost invisible and held of little account.&lt;br /&gt;And yet, the food of these gracious and humble people is nothing short of maravilloso--a delicious alchemy of the cuisines of the Old and New Worlds.  How I wish you had been invited for lunch or dinner to the home of a Oaxacan abuelita (grandma), Molly. What hospitality and warmth you would have found in her tiny cocina! What an unforgettable meal you would have had! It is only in their cocinas where you will find the magnificence of a cuisine of, and for, the ages, prepared by the hands of a master, something no restaurant meal can ever duplicate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My son and I went to Oaxaca about 30 years ago, when he was 12 or so. We didn&#039;t go to the coast, but we hit many of the same places in Oaxaca city and Monte Alban as well. Yes, some of those restaurants were there then! I loved walking down the hill from our hotel to the zocalo every morning to get breakfast with cafe con leche and fresh fruit. Happy memories!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m I spent an incredible week in Oaxaca City last fall at an art retreat and had a glorious time, too.  I can&#039;t say enough about the food! The moles were astoundingly good and Oaxaca is known for seven different types.  I tried them all and I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite.  Oaxaca was as memorable to me as your holiday was for you and your friends.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you try grilled octopus?  OMG... I dream about grilled octopus now!]]></description>
