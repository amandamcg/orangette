					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I&#039;m catching up on your blog and enjoyed this wonderful post. I&#039;m so glad you got a chance to go back to the house one last time and help your Mom. It&#039;s also great that she&#039;ll be closer to you. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was born in 1948 I sought out the tiny house I was crated to in san diego, California it looked like a mansion to me, but it had the neatest porch and I guess my daddy took me there to soothe the colic out of me..i have few pictures as a tinyone my Mom passed young and I was young, houses live in people&#039;s hearts and souls, we have been in our tiny home nearly 37 years at the tip of Washington state it is enough for us, my hubs the oldest of 9 kids with no dad and a mom who hated to cook, clean and parent, he did everything and found places for rent which is impossible in Portland Oregon and Newport Oregon at all now! Enjoy your Mother being with you it is a priceless jewel in  your life and your darling baby girl who is growing up fast, what a cutte pie..We go to Seattle and seek out your place Delancy and I have bought several of your cookbooks, our only adores your cookbooks and I do too, enjoy your time with your family!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Such wonderfully evocative writing! It&#039;s funny, just a few days ago I woke up dreaming about my childhood home where my parents lived for almost 50 years. They sold it and retired in 2001. I kept my eyes closed for a long time after waking up, going over every single thing I could remember and little fleeting moments. I thought about how I could walk around the house in the dark and know exactly where I was going, even down the stairs or into the kitchen. I thought that if I imagined hard enough, I might bring it all back....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Such a beautiful story! It&#039;s amazing how one place can hold so many memories, both bitter and sweet. I&#039;m happy you had a chance to revisit your parents&#039; house and I hope that the next person who lives in it appreciates it as much as you do. Side note: I am still shocked by the image of shattered windows and shards of glass in your Thai beef dish.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This one made me tear up. I can&#039;t even fathom the range of emotions. My parents still live in the only house I have ever known as someone&#039;s child. They&#039;ve been there 40 years this year. ]]></description>
