					<description><![CDATA[I love seeing what books you use regularly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are your thoughts on cookbooks with pictures and without? I grew up on cookbooks with black and white photos or even drawings. Today it seems that mainstream cookbooks are more about flash and less about content. Some great exceptions, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the stories surrounding the recipes and techniques in those old books. sigh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roland]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ditto on Parisian Home Cooking -- it was a gift from a friend years ago and I just love it. Funny how I&#039;d never seen it referenced before, and now all the fans are coming out of the proverbial woodwork.  Our favorite recipe is the Butcher&#039;s Wife&#039;s Pork, known lovingly in our household as &quot;Pickle Pork&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;ve culled a lot of my cookbooks over the years and over a recent move, and now have shelves filled with just those that I love to either (a) use for recipes or (b) just read!  And though I hate to admit it because it&#039;s not super cool or trendy, one of my most used volumes is Bittman&#039;s original How to Cook Everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Yay! that your own books are up there, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t tried the Irish Soda Bread yet, but among the recipes I&#039;ve baked from Grand Central, my favorites are jammers, oatmeal chocolate chip cookies (*everyone* loves these), and the sesame cookies. I am not a big fan of biscotti, but I baked the almond anise biscotti from this book and friends said it was the best ever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting about Michael Roberts Parisian Home Cooking.  I like it better than any of the recently published cookbooks about French cooking -- somehow it seems more authentic.  My favorite chapters are the ones on salads and vegetables.  Great book and why isn&#039;t it more talked about?]]></description>
