  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>My father wasn’t a writer, or not in the vocational sense, but he liked to play with words, and I grew up thinking of him as someone who wrote. He never made a big deal of it; writing was just something he did sometimes, a few quick lines on one of the index cards that he always kept in his shirt pocket. I haven’t seen a lot of his work &#8211; only a goofy poem he once jotted for me on a notepad from a medical conference he went to, and some haikus that we found in his bathroom drawer after he died. Many years ago, in a context that I now don’t remember, my mother told me that Burg tended to write most when he was feeling down, and not so much when he was happy. I don’t know if he would explain it that way, and I can’t ask him, but it resonated with me at the time. Probably because I was a teenager then, and I was doing my own share of mopey writing &#8211; mostly about the tall, long-haired kid who was a senior in my high school when I was a freshman, who played in a moody band with a clever name and reportedly smoked a truly staggering amount of weed <i>but</i>, I was certain, could be reformed into a fine, upstanding boyfriend if only, if only, IF ONLY I could manage to open my mouth and try speaking to him. There was a lot of woe going on, a lot of longing. I had a lot of <i>feelings</i>. In any case, I remember that conversation with my mother, and I remember thinking, <i>Ah ha! That’s it! I too write the most, and the best, when I’m unhappy. That’s the trick&#8230;</i></p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/63c14-450400031.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/63c14-450400031.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="600" height="590" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>Of course, that was sort of an unhelpful realization, and after some years passed and I stopped being a teenager (FINALLY), I began to see that it was not only unhelpful, but also untrue.  I discovered other ways to approach writing and other things to write about. I think we can all be grateful for that. Though I do wonder what happened to the tall, long-haired kid.  He’s totally unGoogleable, and you know I’ve tried. He’s also now almost forty.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/649c3-741700101.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/649c3-741700101.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="600" height="400" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>Anyway, what I’m trying to say, and I swear that I really am going somewhere here, is: I don’t like being unhappy, and I don’t like writing about being unhappy. It’s boring, and it makes me tired. But about three weeks ago, I was diagnosed with postpartum depression, and I don’t see a way to <i>not </i>write about it. It began in the form of insomnia, and it took me a while to recognize it, because it was more complicated than I thought depression would be: I wasn’t sad so much as I was overwhelmed. Statistically, something like one in ten mothers get postpartum depression, but few seem to talk about it &#8211; or at least, few that I’ve found. When I was diagnosed, and when I was first trying to make sense of it, what I wanted most was to talk with another woman who had been through it and come out the other side, someone who could reassure me with full confidence that it wouldn’t be a permanent condition. I knew that logically, intellectually, but <i>THE HORMONES, </i>they pull the wool over your eyes, and the wool, whoa, it is <i>heavy.</i> You spend nine months growing a real live human baby in your abdomen, and then you push that baby out, and then you feed that baby milk that your body somehow makes, and though we mammals have been doing it for as long as we mammals have existed, it is big, weird, screwy stuff. It makes you have more feelings than you did when you were fifteen, and they feel very <i>real</i>. And in my case, the case of postpartum depression, they don’t go away when they should, and instead, they build.</p>
<p>I am grateful to have been able to ask for help, and I’m relieved that the help is actually helping. I am grateful for Brandon, and I am grateful for June. And though I would certainly rather just <i>la la la</i> pretend that it never happened, I want to write this down, on the off chance that you or someone you know needs to hear it. I am grateful that I can now reassure <i>myself</i> that this isn’t a permanent condition, that I now believe it.</p>

      <p>A roommate of mine from school had a really rough go of it with postpartum depression after delivering her firstborn. I remember talking with her when she was completely in the thrall of it. And I can safely say, she has come out with flying colors and two other kids. So, I&#39;m glad you got the help and support you need, and there is another side. Hang in there Molly.</p>

      <p>Really glad to hear you&#39;re working through it. I&#39;ve done a lot of social work with women with postpartum depression, and it is amazing how fast and how fiercely it can take you over. It&#39;s terrifying until you know what you&#39;re dealing with, and then it&#39;s infuriating. Like you don&#39;t have enough other stuff to deal with, what with keeping a new person alive. </p>
<p>Best of luck to all three of you. </p>

      <p>Thank you for writing this. My wonderful son arrived 14 months ago and I don&#39;t think it hit me till he was about 6 months old that I&#39;d been in a postpartum fog all for much of that time. I was never treated for depression because I didn&#39;t recognize myself as being depressed. Like you, I felt more overwhelmed than plainly sad. In my mind there would have been no shame in saying I was depressed; I just didn&#39;t see myself as being so. Your post is welcome for new mothers who perhaps feel caught of guard by how emotional they feel, even while they are functioning. Mothering an infant is a heady, hard time, depression or none, and we owe it to ourselves and each other to be more frank about that. Congratulations on getting help and thank you for sharing. </p>
<p>P.S. June is beautiful beyond words.</p>

      <p>Oh wow. I&#39;m so grateful I read this. I feel like lots of bloggers have had babies in this past year and they gush and gush about how happy, wonderful and perfect their lives are now. Something tells me that&#39;s not really how they feel 100% of the time. And most of all, I wish they wouldn&#39;t post such stuff because it makes the rest of us feel like we should feel that way too, 24 hours a day.<br />Thanks for writing this down, and thanks for sharing.

Wow.<br />Then I have to tell you that my children are all grown up, and that my post partum depression&#8230;only had it with one of three, DID seem overwhelming, and DID seem awful and cruel, but it did pass.

      <p>Molly, while I didn&#39;t get diagnosed with PPD, I was depressed postpartum, and I have a close friend who was diagnosed, and we both have sassy 5 year olds now and that PPD is all but a memory. A clear memory, but gone nonetheless. It sucks, that&#39;s really all there is to it. Having a baby is hard, emotionally harder for some of us. Raw, brutal, painful, and so exhausting. But it most certainly gets better. Thank you for sharing your story for others. The best thing we can do as mothers is support each other. Sending all my love and strength up north to you! Much love, Posy </p>

      <p>Bravo to you, Molly, for writing about post partum depression. Not until my youngest of 3 was 42, was I able to understand what happened to me after each of my beauties was born.  It was crippling and the memories of it hung over my life until I found a blog post about PPD several years ago.  I have never felt so free and relieved to know it was not just me. <br />June is the most beautiful baby and I wish you every happiness, peace and joy as each second of her life brings new wonder.<br />A long time reader and admirer from Cape Cod.</p>

      <p>Your writing is the highlight of my day. Your words are strong, intelligent, profound and beautifully articulated. That you have been able write this, right now, shows you are recovering. May that process continue with speed and the grace you show here. June is a very lucky little girl to have such a remarkable Mommy and that sweet and precious picture shows us she knows it. With compassion and admiration and the sure knowledge you won&#39;t always feel like this and like childbirth, you will forget how bad it can be! </p>

      <p>Wow.  I get to be your first comment on this blog.  I&#39;m on your site for the first time having finished your book 45 seconds ago because I could not put it down, even to do the smarky (is that word?) school reading I am supposed to be doing. Needless to say I loved your book and how amazing to find out that I&#39;ve eaten at your restaurant too and didn&#39;t even know it was yours &#8211; of course I didn&#39;t know you then.  Congratulations on that beautiful dark haired baby of yours and all I can say to pp depression is that it sucks. After my first the only thing that kept me going was reading a book about women climbing Annapurna and I kept thinking &#8220;if she can do this, I can take care of this one little baby.&#8221;  Hang in there. I am grateful for your words and for the yummy food yet to emerge from my kitchen, thanks to you.</p>

      <p>I think you writing this WILL help someone, b/c it&#39;s very scary being a new mother.  I have never been diagnosed with depression but I sometimes wonder what would it feel like.  I also wouldn&#39;t say that I had postpartum depression, but I do say that I had 12 weeks of nursing hell and my whole life revolved around my boobs until one day around the magic number of 12 weeks, life moved on and I didn&#39;t think about my boobs every second or minute or hour of the day.  BTW, June is freakin&#39; adorable! Congrats!  It just gets better every day, even when they&#39;re toddlers.</p>

I, for one (and I&#39;m sure there will be countless others), am so grateful you have chosen to talk about this. <br />You&#39;re right about there being few people who seem to discuss it, and having seen a close friend almost undone by undiagnosed post-partum depression, I wish we would all talk about it more. <br />Now 5 months pregnant with my first, I hope I am not afflicted with this heavy, heavy stuff in a few months time, but should I be unlucky enough, I&#39;ll be so grateful to know there is help, there ARE others and they DO come through it.<br />Thank you.</p>

      <p>Sorry that you&#39;re going through this, but good for you for getting a diagnosis, asking for help, and working your way through this.</p>
<p>And thank you so much for sharing. I&#39;ve not been through this (stupid infertility), but that is also something that people don&#39;t talk about. And we should.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s just talk about (almost) everything.</p>

      <p>Sorry that you&#39;re going through this, but good for you for getting a diagnosis, asking for help, and working your way through this.</p>
<p>And thank you so much for sharing. I&#39;ve not been through this (stupid infertility), but that is also something that people don&#39;t talk about. And we should.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s just talk about (almost) everything.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself. Allow others to take care of you too. </p>
<p>June is beautiful. </p>

      <p>That was beautiful, Molly. Those early days are overwhelming, but one day, months or even years from now, you&#39;ll have a down day and realize that you used to feel like that all the time and you haven&#39;t in ages. It happens in tiny baby steps. Then, the next thing you know, she&#39;ll be 16 and you&#39;ll be sharing all of your favourite books, music, and movies with her. Parenting rocks!</p>

      <p>I have to thank you for writing about what your going through. Today it seems that it&#39;s perfectly acceptably to have a psychiatrist (sometime it seems like it&#39;s in vogue) but actually discussing one&#39;s mental health is still frowned upon. As someone who has struggled with depression from adolescence it is nice to see someone with your profile discuss such a personal matter in a open and honest way. Post like this teach others to not be ashamed of their thoughts and that there is help out there. I hope this phase passes quickly for you and any one else struggling with PPD.</p>

      <p>I been staying at home with my two small children, a 4 year old boy and a 2 year old girl, since my youngest was born.  I underestimated how difficult it would be and how well I would manage.  Just in the last six months I finally realized that something was wrong, that it&#39;s not normal to have to lock yourself in the bathroom to sob and silently beg someone to help you at least once a week.  And so I got help.  And everything is so much better. I keep telling my husband that I feel like an actual person again. I&#39;m embarrassed it took so long, but then I&#39;m also still a little embarrassed that I needed help, that I couldn&#39;t just suck it up.  I hate that.  And so I appreciate it when people are honest about their struggles, even though only a small number of people know how difficult it&#39;s been for me.  So thank you for sharing.</p>

      <p>When I was going through it, I felt like I was wading through mud. Trying to do full time college, full time job and full time parenting (with my husband), it was the hardest thing I ever have had to go through. And the thing is, I wasn&#39;t diagnosed until my daughter was 6 months old. </p>
<p>It&#39;s so hard to talk about because most of the feelings are loneliness, overwhelm and guilt. And when I breastfed instead of getting warm fuzzies, I got washes of shame. FOR 8 MONTHS. So, you are not alone. Thank you for sharing your story.

      <p>You gorgeous girl.  Firstly, I have to acknowledge that delicious bundle of Juneliciousness, my gosh!  Secondly, I have to lift you a little and tell you that your number 1 Spilled Milk fan here in Australia (Ella) has been relistening to all the episodes from number 1 through and my goodness does she belly laugh every time.  We also posted you a letter this week &#8211; look out for it!  Thirdly PND &#8211; it&#39;s dreadful.  I was fine with my first child, Ella, but with our second, Leila, I was sooo down.  Everything seemed so challenging, so much harder than I remembered.  It was super hot, she was a fussy baby, I had a 3 year old to manage, I was older, but I remember clearly as you describe, the weight of it.  I added to that my confusion and belief that I should know better, I should be doing better, I had done it all before, so why wasn&#39;t I doing a better job?  I remember doing a test that they do regularly with maternal health asking a bunch of set question in relation to PND and seeing where you rate then suggests you may be &#8220;at risk&#8221;.  The questions were innocuous enough, but apparently I did very poorly.  I met with a Counsellor and she referred me to a support group.  I remember finding it so challenging to leave the baby and my 3yo in their childcare for the hour it required, not something I&#39;d ever done, feeling a failure just having to leave my children because I wasn&#39;t doing well enough.  I went to two sessions and was lucky enough that it helped me through but my gosh, some of the women I met, they were hurting so much.  Two of them came in pjs to both sessions, it was so sad to see their suffering.  Is it wrong, but for me, it shook me out of it, made me feel that I COULD cope, that I had it easy in comparison.  I&#39;m not downplaying anyone&#39;s experience, but I was so humbled I guess, but how hard it was for them, it was enough to urge me on beyond it.  Now, when I look back to those early 3-6 months with Leila, I find it hard to remember much at all, it&#39;s blurred around the edges.  I look at the photos from that time and there are ones of me smiling, holding her, looking happy &#8211; I can&#39;t remember it, but I see them and know that I  must have been.  Don&#39;t feel alone, don&#39;t feel (as I did) any sense of letting anyone down, it&#39;s the most wonderful and hardest job there is and you have a busy life.  You amaze me with all you and Brandon have achieved, all you do, we LOVE you in this house and I KNOW that you bring to mothering June all that amazing qualities, just remember to look after you and what Molly needs just as much.</p>

      <p>Motherhood is very hard, and the first several months is by far the hardest time. It is a sea change. And yes, the hormones are relentless. That baby is unbearably cute though. The cuteness is what helps you through it all, even when they become willful toddlers. Glad you are surfacing. </p>

      <p>I am not glad to <i>see</i> this, but I am glad you wrote it &#8211; if that makes sense. </p>
<p>I was severely depressed for over a year, up until this fall. I didn&#39;t even realize for the first couple of months and if not for the death of a close friend of mine, I doubt I&#39;d have even begun to deal with it. I  felt, at many times, lower than I thought possible. At my worst, I was completely terrified of life. </p>
<p>I have tried, in the months since, to take better care of myself. I didn&#39;t know how to ask for help. I still don&#39;t. I&#39;m glad that you did, and that you&#39;ve written it here. It can only help. </p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been reading awhile, but never commented. I had a baby 3.5 months ago, and while I&#39;ve had no postpartum depression, I commend you for being honest about it. Sometimes when everyone is telling you to enjoy everything about new motherhood, it&#39;s incredibly difficult to admit that you can&#39;t and that you&#39;re not okay. <br />I wish you well.</p>

      <p>My friend, Molly, who is literally in the South Pole right now emailed me the link to this blog post today. </p>
<p>I had my little girl, Helen, this last June and Molly slowly watched as I became unraveled then tangled up in the complete hell which is PPD.</p>
<p>I have my own blog and have been spending the last month trying record my story, but that itself takes so much strength to regurgitate. I always wondered why so many women don&#39;t talk about their experience more, but now I get it. It takes a lot of courage to go back &#8220;there&#8221; when all you want to do is move on with your life. I commend you for sharing your story. When I was in the middle of it, I too just wanted to find SOMEONE who recovered. It was soooooooooooo hard believing it, but man it is true. We did it. You are a strong and even better person for it too. June&#39;s got one brave mama.</p>

      <p>Oh, dear, those damn hormones&#8230;  I have three kids, the oldest is ten, the youngest three, and I can assure you, when you are in the thick of sleep deprivation, worry, and hormonal crazy-ness, it&#39;s hard to imagine that you will ever feel normal again.  Ever.<br />Alas, you will.<br />But I feel for you, I really do.  I&#39;ve been there, done that, and it really helped me to talk to other people about it.  New moms tend to NOT want to admit they have postpartum depression, since every one tells them they should be happy because they have this new precious baby.<br />F#$% that!  Of course our new baby is magnificent.  Of course we should be happy.  Yet we feel totally down, sad, depressed, scared, and it feels like something is wrong with us.  Well, there isn&#39;t.<br />So all I&#39;m trying to say here is, hang in there, Mama.  You will feel better again.  I did!<br />Much love to you, and to your sweet family!</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been reading your blog for a while now. It&#39;s delightful. While making food and opening restaurants and writing about it all is nothing to sneeze at, being a mother isn&#39;t as tidy as all the hard work of being a successful woman. It&#39;s a little messier than the facebook pages let on. Thanks for being honest; not sure why we get cold feet about saying things are unraveling sometimes. You are in your element as a mother when you can admit that, and June is a lucky girl. Best to you and wishes for an amazing year ahead.</p>

      <p>Oh, Molly, she&#39;s so beautiful.  You will get through it.  I have faith.  I was just talking to my husband on a long drive home tonight about how everything just seems to matter more since we had our children, two and four now.  I feel everything so much more.  I can&#39;t watch a lot of movies that I used to, or read short stories (short stories are rarely uplifting, you know).  These little beings change us so profoundly.

      <p>Hi&#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been reading your blog for four years&#8230;about since the time that I had my own first baby and found myself flung overnight from a hip and foxy non-profit-organizer to a frumpy and sleep deprived milk machine.  I&#39;ve never commented before, but I wanted to tell you that I&#39;ve been there.  I too had postpartum depression.  I applaud your post and am here to say, without a doubt, that it absolutely will get better.  Motherhood and postpartum depression forced me to reinvent myself and challenged all of my perceptions of who I was.  It changed me in ways I am grateful for today.  One day, in the not too distant future you will suddenly realize that you feel like yourself again&#8230;except better.  </p>

      <p>I don&#39;t have anything personal to share with you &#8211; I&#39;ve never had a baby. But I have been seriously depressed, and when I was, the single most helpful thing I found out was that <i>other people feel this way too</i>. Somehow, in my years of being happy, I&#39;d missed that. So thank you for writing this down, and letting other people know that they aren&#39;t alone. I know I&#39;ll remember it. And to you, big hugs. This is hard, and you&#39;re so brave, and strong, and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re getting help. And your baby, she is so so beautiful. </p>

      <p>I had my first child in April and was terrified when I would start crying over nothing, really.

      <p>Molly, I was first introduced to you through your book when I was in the midst of being diagnosed with, what we now know is, a very treatable cancer&#8230;blessings come in strange forms sometimes.

      <p>Oh my dear goodness.  I was there, I know.  It took me six years to have a second child because I was so terrified that it would happen again and it did, and it was so unfair.  I DID NOT SLEEP &#8211; for days, for weeks, I don&#39;t even know how long.</p>
<p>Someone that I barely knew emailed me to say that she understood &#8211; and that was something since I did my best the first time to hide it from everyone.  Nothing has meant more to me than that statement.</p>

<p>One day I will tell my girls how I walked away and said I&#39;d never come back, but then I did, and I will be there for them if they need it in the same way that my husband and my family were there for me.  I felt so robbed by it all, but your beautiful daughter &#8211; our beautiful girls &#8211; will be just fine.  There is another side and we get there, even though we certainly can&#39;t see it for ourselves for awhile.</p>

      <p>You&#39;re so right.  More people should talk about it.  I had it with both my children and it was debilitating in a way I was totally unprepared for.  I was a totally different person from the one who wanted these children to be here before they came out.  It was scary, it was lonely, and it was real.  With my second I ended up using medication instead of waiting it out (3 long months) with my first and one day I woke up and was myself again. My positive, happy to be alive and in love with both my children self.  </p>

      <p>Hi Molly, I just wanted to let you know that I&#39;ve known many a woman to have suffered postpartum depression and as someone who went through a lot of emotional highs and lows as a teenager (and was also convinced that my best writing came at a time of unhappiness), the possibility of going through a similar experience has been at the back of my mind. I&#39;ve actually been thinking about how I could mentally prepare myself for *the possibility* of being depressed after my baby arrives, which I am sure is silly. In any case, I am sure it is very difficult to see the other side of the tunnel, even if you tell yourself it&#39;s just your hormones, but I am glad that you are getting help and you at least know that your condition is only temporary. A big hug to you for being honest with yourself and for sharing your story with others who I am sure will benefit from reading your post. I&#39;ll see you on the other side soon, I know it. 🙂</p>

A big hug to you for being honest with yourself and for sharing your story with others who I am sure will benefit from reading your post. I&#39;ll see you on the other side soon, I know it. 🙂</p>

      <p>Look at your beautiful baby!  Thank you for sharing your experience.  My kids are older now, but I remember those days, and they were hard.  I&#39;m glad for you that you could ask for help and that it&#39;s helping.  Hang in there!</p>

      <p>What a beauty!</p>
<p>And I, too, found myself dealing with PPD in addition to PPA after the birth of my second child. Part of it related to some minor but crappy life circumstances but a lot of it was exhaustion. I imagine if I had gotten more sleep in my pregnancy &#038; in the first 6 months of my boy&#39;s life I would not have slumped as low as I did. And the other thing that was tricky for me in terms of recognizing PPD was that I never felt SO low. But certainly miserable, and I knew that I shouldn&#39;t be feeling miserable in my &#8220;happy&#8221; life. Anyway, I wrote a post about it if you are interested: <a href="http://navigatingthemothership.blogspot.com/2012/05/all-i-can-do-is-keep-breathing.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://navigatingthemothership.blogspot.com/2012/05/all-i-can-do-is-keep-breathing.html</a></p>

      <p>I&#39;ve followed your blog for a couple of years, ever since I read &#8220;A Homemade Life&#8221;.  Without looking for it, I found your book in a bookstore about 3 weeks after I lost my mom to cancer in November 2010.  The cover caught my eye and I love reading about food, so I flipped through the pages and immediately saw the chapter on mottling.  I sat down in the bookstore and began to cry because I knew all too well the significance of that word and my grief was still very raw.  I was definitely not expecting to find a book that talked about losing a parent to cancer in the cooking section of the bookstore, but I&#39;m so grateful that I did.  We&#39;re around the same age (I&#39;m 33) and I was able to relate to so much of what you wrote about in the book.  It was comforting.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never commented here before, but I wanted to say &#8220;thank you&#8221; for this post.  My husband and I don&#39;t have kids, so I don&#39;t pretend to relate to what you&#39;re dealing with as far as the PPD.  But I&#39;m glad you posted this because it&#39;s nice to read some honesty.  Too many people try to portray the perfect life online and it&#39;s not often that someone has the guts to say- &#8220;Hey, I&#39;m going through something here and I need some help to find my way out&#8221;.  It&#39;s refreshing, it&#39;s honest, and it&#39;s human.  Thanks for keeping it real.  You never know who is reading and who you may have helped by sharing this experience.  And your daughter&#39;s picture- gorgeous.  Take care of yourself.</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been reading your blog off and on for 3 or 4 years. I&#39;m so glad to see you take the risk to share your dealings with postpartum depression. My son is almost two years old, and I weathered postpartum depression (starting a little bit before he was born, actually) for most of his first 18 months. I had several fits of uncontrollable weeping, but like you said, it was more feeling pushed to the breaking point of overwhelmed than actually being sad. I loved my baby but I was filled with anxiety of all I had to do on my own (my husband was working and in school) to take care of him. Many people tried to tell me it would get better, but they were many people who had never experienced any type of depression, and it came off sounding like, &#8220;get over it&#8221; at the time. I am glad to tell you that it does get better, even if it&#39;s in ups and downs. The ups get higher and closer together, and the downs get shallower, too. 🙂</p>

      <p>Almost 32 years ago, my daughter surprised me by arriving a month early.  Although she was healthy and we were able to take her home right away, she needed to nurse every two hours&#8230;not much sleep and very sore nipples.  After a month, I was a basket case.

      <p>Like many who commented, I have been faithfully reading your blog for a certain number of years and have very rarely commented.  Today, I come out of internet anonymity to say thank you and bravo to be so courageous.  There is another side &#8211; you are almost there -, it&#39;s nobody&#39;s fault (but the hormones&#39;, maybe), and writing about it with so simple and humble words is a gift to many.<br />Now, I have to say AWWWWW, you have the most beautiful little girl ever!!!</p>

      <p>Like many who commented, I have been faithfully reading your blog for a certain number of years and have very rarely commented.  Today, I come out of internet anonymity to say thank you and bravo to be so courageous.  There is another side &#8211; you are almost there -, it&#39;s nobody&#39;s fault (but the hormones&#39;, maybe), and writing about it with so simple and humble words is a gift to many.<br />Now, I have to say AWWWWW, you have the most beautiful little girl ever!!!</p>

      <p>Molly you are brave and wise as ever. It will pass &#8211; and you will ride the wave as you have so many others. </p>
<p>And that June is so stinking cute that it makes me smile every time I see her. What a wonderful photo! I&#39;m glad that it seems you can recognize and appreciate the good all around you even in the throes of those deep dark hormones. Keep it up and you&#39;ll be through to the other side before you know it. </p>
<p>Be well! xo</p>

      <p>I had PPD with this go round and it completely blindsided me because I didn&#39;t have it with number one.  I&#39;m grateful to a friend of mine for pointing it out to me, and my husband for taking it seriously enough to call my doctor for me ( since I was too overwhelmed).  I got medication (low dose Wellbutrin. &#8211; I call them my happy pills) and it helped tremendously. I was able to enjoy the baby and bond with him.   Anyway, I&#39;ve been there, it sucks, and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re on the way out and can enjoy your darling daughter. </p>

      <p>Molly &#8211; I was never diagnosed but looking back I think I must have been flirting with PPD &#8211; I look at pictures of the time my boy was between 2 and 6 months and see my smiling face and can&#39;t remember feeling that way on the inside. He was my joy and I was terrified of all the things that could happen to him. It does get better and take advantage of everyone who offers help. There are better and brighter days ahead. Good luck with your gorgeous girl.</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been there, and it sucked. And the hardest part about it all is the way in which you feel so overwhelmed so that even the most minimal of self-care (like getting help) seems too much. I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t for you.

      <p>I love that you had the courage to post this! I had my first baby about a month after June was born (I was rather envious when I read your post announcing her birth ;-)). While I haven&#39;t experienced depression I have found that many of the books meant to help romanticize the entire experience from pregnancy to delivery to nursing to learning to care for this person in a way that is unhelpful, unrealistic, and can easily make a &#8220;normal&#8221; person think they have a problem for having struggles or not enjoying every bit of it. So thanks for sharing when things aren&#39;t perfect, I&#39;ll be praying for you and Brandon and June. </p>

      <p>Thank you for writing so honestly about this weight. Motherhood, while it&#39;s often portrayed as one long joyous journey, is so difficult and asks you to be creative and energized all the time. It&#39;s overwhelming even for those like me who&#39;ve never been diagnosed with PPD. I have two daughters and am a much more anxious person than I ever was before they were born. <br />When they were still small, I knew friends with PPD, and saw them get help, and witnessed big changes when the depression lifted. It&#39;s so wonderful you&#39;ve decided to get help and to talk about it. More of us could learn from you.<br />Meantime, you can continue to share any pictures of June that you would like. What a bundle of sweetness!</p>

      <p>Thanks for your bravery and honesty in writing this post. No-one talks about postpartum. I was completely unprepared when it happened to me with my first child. Even now I feel so alone and ashamed in my experience. None of the other mothers share stories of anything like what happened to me. The heart racing, the insomnia, the crying, and helplessness. It took 11 months before I got help and it didn&#39;t go away or get better in all that time. It nearly destroyed my marriage. I wish I&#39;d known what was going on sooner and had help sooner. The antidepressant worked. I felt like myself again. Not over the top happy or drugged, just normal. And I could sleep again! Such a relief. After a year I was able to stop the medication. Now expecting our second child I know the signs to watch for and am determined to get help much sooner if I need it. I want to enjoy the first year of my child&#39;s life, not look back on a blur of deep exhaustion and sadness. I want to bond with my baby right away and not have that taken away like it was last time. If only more people talked about postpartum openly, I might have known what was happening sooner and not been so ashamed to get the help I needed. Thank you for sharing your story. You are not alone. It does get better from here. I needed so much to hear another parent say that with my first baby. It&#39;s true. </p>

      <p>I was in constant awe- and often tears which felt joyful to me- after my first child was born.  I felt like I was overwhelmed with a sense of wonder, and of duty.  I also felt simultaneously as though I had joined a club of womanhood that I was meant to join and that I was alone on a new journey.  My husband was both absent from our home and the big new deal of it and opinionated about everything to do with parenting and with breastfeeding and with&#8230; My mother pushed for medication.  My husband teased me saying that people could be talking about avocados and I would burst into tears- which, while true, didn&#39;t help me at all.  I remember being so consumed by my new role and all that I didn&#39;t realize that I shouldn&#39;t be bleeding six weeks later- it turned out to be a piece of calcified placenta had to be removed.  Finally, there was a moment- I can really pinpoint this- when my emotionality became recognizable and I emerged. I remember taking the trash out and, on my return through the yard, I looked up, breathed in the evening and I had a very clear thought that my baby was wonderful and that I was going to be OK.  Thank you for sharing- know that you&#39;re not alone and will put through it.</p>

      <p>It seems (at least often to me) that too few people talk about the things in life that aren&#39;t shiny and happy and perfect and while those things are less fun to talk about, they are real and honest and true and very much a part of life.

      <p>My friend had severe PPD, and for what it&#39;s worth I&#39;ll share a few things I remember from our conversations.  Among many other insights she came to think that the birth and reality of dealing daily with so much responsibility was simultaneously hugely anti-climactic and overwhelming.  And it depressed her that no one had prepared her for it.  Yes, the love and connection is monumental, but we ended up believing PPD was a sort of serotonin deficit created by the whole experience of overwhelm and sleep deprivation that left her depleted.  To support this theory, she ate seratonin rich foods, like edamame and buckwheat and took a supplement called 5-htp from NOW foods.  She wanted to avoid chemical drugs.</p>
<p>Women have been doing this since the dawn of time, yet we haven&#39;t shared with each other enough about the mixed emotions and and sheer effort of will having a child requires, so that we are all fully mentally prepared.  So weird.  Thank You for doing it.  Sending love and light.</p>
<p>PS: another friend said she would not have been able to do the first few months without a doula who came Every Day to help.  I think we need a lot of support and as helpful as a husband may be, unless he has Swedish paternity leave, he is unlikely to be there during the day when you need company and support.  A doula you connect with seems imperative.</p>

<p>PS: another friend said she would not have been able to do the first few months without a doula who came Every Day to help.  I think we need a lot of support and as helpful as a husband may be, unless he has Swedish paternity leave, he is unlikely to be there during the day when you need company and support.  A doula you connect with seems imperative.</p>

      <p>Like many others, I read your blog religiously but never feel compelled to comment until now.  It took me a while to realize that I was depressed after the birth my oldest son.  I hated breast feeding and felt ashamed for feeling that way.  He was a needy, cranky baby and there were times that I did not want to have him near me.  I felt sad, alone, and a failure for not loving my son or even really liking him.  After a few weeks I gave up breastfeeding and felt better.<br />  When my youngest son was born, I soon realized that I was in the grip of PPD.  He was a happy bouncy baby who smiled all the time.  I was an unhappy mother who felt that she could barely handle a two year old and certainly felt overwhelmed with an infant.  I knew that I was well-educated, and had a lot of support around me, yet I used to tell my husband that I could understand how some people could harm their children even without truly meaning to.  Sleep deprivation, hormones, the overwhelming responsibility of caring for two people who completely depended on me just stopped me in my tracks.  I worried about their future, I worried that I was about to scream.  I worried that I could not do it.  I worried, and worried, and then got some help.  I realized later that I was in a fog and after some time the fog had cleared and I could go back to loving my children, my family, and my life.<br />My boys are 20 and 17 and I can honestly say that I grew up with them.  I am also grateful for the PPD in many ways as it made me a more compassionate person (though i thought of myself as compassionate before).  I had more patience, appreciated things more, and have tried to let the small things slide.  <br />Most importantly, as you can see from the many comments, we hear you and we are here for you.  </p>

      <p>So glad you are sharing what is real. Also, I think perhaps it is not so much that we write better when we are sad (like you said) but I know at least for me it is that I best process things by writing when I am sad.</p>

      <p>Oh, she is so beautiful!  I have two boys who are now 6 &#038; 5. I wasn&#39;t diagnosed with post partum, but I remember so clearly sobbing at my second son&#39;s 1week appointment. I think that the doctor kept an eye on me and within a few more weeks the severity of EVERYTHING lessened.  With both boys, those newborn months were so intense. And sometimes painful. There is just such a huge shift. I really don&#39;t do well wit change, how did I not see all that difficulty coming. But I can see so clearly now &#8211; almost the way you can look back on adolescence angst- and see how really hard it was. But also that it didn&#39;t stay that way. Today it&#39;s really lovely.

      <p>Oh my the hormones! As I holed up in my newborn&#39;s nursery, crying out hormones in that ugly, wracking way every evening at 7 p.m., I feared this was how postpartum would manifest for me. Thankfully, three nights later, the hormone leak wrapped itself up, and there was only one person — and a person who could sleep — left rattling around in my brain anymore.</p>
<p>Not that newborns aren&#39;t overwhelming most of the time anyway. But. I was much more prepared for the hormones the second time around. And in case you were wondering, they knew I was prepared and changed their game.</p>

      <p>Writing is such a powerful thing.  Never more so then those points in your life that are grey.  I have always been a writer, but when I found myself a mother of two under two and caring for my ailing mother, it was writing that kept my head above water.  I needed a place that was happy and upbeat and could escape the despair I felt watching my mother wilt away.  It has been three and a half years since she died.  Now, writing is taking a new role in my life.  It is helping me articulate where things are now.  My children are both in school and my mother is rarely mentioned in my daily life.  I suppose most people don&#39;t really remember her or the years that I was caring for her  Life is not what I expected as a child, but it is still beautiful in its own way.  I have survived things I never thought I could.  I am different, but I am happy and I am loved.  </p>

      <p>(&#8230;.sorry, my comment posted before I was finished.)  I think that there is a place for private and public writing when you are in these desperate points in your life.  I admire your courage in sharing these times in a public form.  It is making a difference.  Thank you for your words and your story.  </p>

      <p>o, molly, so glad you shared this.<br />i&#39;m glad you sought help, etc.<br />sleep deprivation is tough, too, with newborns. have you considered doing yoga? it helps me to be more balanced, sleep well, and much more, of course. if you could find a good teacher and fit it in here and there with mothering/restauranting/writing, it could be very helpful.<br />xo, melissa<br />p.s. she&#39;s so cute!</p>

      <p>Molly, I am really sorry you&#39;re going through this. As is my husband, who knew exactly who you were when I said &#8220;the Ed Fretwell soup lady&#8221; and who also cooed over the photo of June.</p>
<p>I did not get PPD, but I remember the strangest experience, almost like seeing the opening of a dark path in a wood.  It hovered around for a few days, and while I didn&#39;t go down it, I saw just how easily the situation could be a little different and I would&#8211;and that there wouldn&#39;t have been any choice about it.  It was scary, and I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;re there and glad you have people and resources to guide you out of it.</p>

      <p>I got all upsett over nothing after the delivery of our only child, my neighbor a clinical psychologist suggested subtlly something was wrong, I sought help, oh my goodness it helped me. We only  had one baby doll and she is nearing 36 used to live in Seattle and is a foodie..She never wants kids and is crazy about others babies, but never her. She said all the babysitting when in junior high and college was enough for her, she thought it an enormous amount of strain, in that she loves to work in films and travels all around the world and would not give it up for a tiny dolly like your JUNE, who in my opinion has to be the cutest I ever seen in about nearly 36 years since our only childs birth.Me I am swooning over her picture, I help at a food pantry and hold the babies, diaper them, love on them while their parents get food for themselves and dine with their toddlers and other children. I am thankful to remember to go to your blog I forgot the name for a while..but I love your writings they are so how can i say it REAL, plus you live in Seattle where we love to visit our only dolly lived there for 5 years, many friends, and a boy who is still smitten for her, he has only known her since Kindergarten, can you imagine. Happy New Year, Happy writings, Happy Happy and beautfiul baby JUNE and your hubbs Brandon sounds like a doll too. peace out!</p>

      <p>A woman began coming into my flower shop a few months ago with her new baby.  She and her husband had moved into a recently renovated condo building.  She would always stay for at least a 1/2 hour, asking questions, praising this or that.  On her third or fourth visit, I became a little annoyed because she seemed to be clinging to the corners of the shop and reluctant to leave.  She was very sweet, and after she left I began to realize that she was having trouble.  I never had PPD, but I had worried that I would.  </p>
<p>Her visits became less frequent and I tried to be attentive when she came in and make her feel welcome. (I felt like a jerk being annoyed with her previously).  I&#39;ll bet lots of women go through this with no diagnosis and look for relief in libraries, gift shops, flower shops or museums.  I think she&#39;s better now.</p>

      <p>So good of you to share this.  It happened to me too, a long time ago, and it wasn&#39;t something one shared in those days.  Thought I was just a horrible person and mother.  I also quit smoking the first time I nursed my baby girl, and that made me bonafide crazy.  That and being housebound for the first time!  It led to me cooking hundreds and hundreds of crepes in three hot iron pans, and because my friends were intrigued and wanted to learn, so I began cooking classes in my kitchen that led authoring seven bestselling cookbooks and my own cooking show.  I look at it all now as one of my two life-altering times of what I call &#8220;dark beauty.&#8221;  You are a woman who has inspired me greatly, and your life ahead is is, as Oprah says, &#8221; . . . so bright it burns my eyes!&#8221;  Hang in there, beautiful!</p>

      <p>So good of you to share this.  It happened to me too, a long time ago, and it wasn&#39;t something one shared in those days.  Thought I was just a horrible person and mother.  I also quit smoking the first time I nursed my baby girl, and that made me bonafide crazy.  That and being housebound for the first time!  It led to me cooking hundreds and hundreds of crepes in three hot iron pans, and because my friends were intrigued and wanted to learn, so I began cooking classes in my kitchen that led authoring seven bestselling cookbooks and my own cooking show.  I look at it all now as one of my two life-altering times of what I call &#8220;dark beauty.&#8221;  You are a woman who has inspired me greatly, and your life ahead is is, as Oprah says, &#8221; . . . so bright it burns my eyes!&#8221;  Hang in there, beautiful!</p>

      <p>June is radiant!  Blessings to you as you navigate this exhausting time.  </p>
<p>Joy and despair, well remembered.  I had my one and only when I was 42.  Had such difficulty with breast-feeding and dealing with it all that a friend flew from the Chicago area to eastern Virginia to help me out in a way my husband couldn&#39;t.  And the hormones!  A week after we got home, I threw the covers off the bed.  I was absolutely burning up!  Within a minute or so I was so chilled that my teeth were chattering involuntarily.  No one had mentioned that such things could happen.</p>
<p>Seek whatever you need to help you.  Adore June whenever you are able, send her blesssings when you&#39;re just not up to adoring.  Both of you will make it through.  Sending love your way.</p>

      <p>I had what I realize now must have been ppd after my daughter was born a year and half ago.

      <p>Sure enough, not a lot of women talk about this, altho Brooke Shields actually broke through the silence and wrote a book about postpartum depression.I suffered from it, as well as clinically diagnosed &#8220;sleep deprivation&#8221; and was ordered to have, among other things, two weeks of bed rest. Women need to speak up about these health things that are NOT our fault &#8212; just part and parcel of being women. Three years after the birth of my second son, at the age of 38, I was diagnosed with PMDD, and will likely suffer from the symptoms until menopause (in about 3 years). I joke that I&#39;m the only woman in America looking forward to menopause, but I know that&#39;s not even true. Molly, you belong to a wonderful club of mothers. Stay strong, keep your eye on the important stuff, take deep breaths, and you&#39;ll still be writing (mostly) about happy stuff.</p>

      <p>Dear Molly: FEAR NOT !!!!! </p>
<p>I suffered through Postpartum Depression forty years ago. There were several monstrous things going on at the same time. The odds were really stacked against me and my baby, Joshua. My baby had his days and nights mixed up, we lived with my in-laws, and this meant that every time during the night the he needed to be asleep, he was not, and I would walk him in my arms most of the night to keep the crying at a minimum. I had felt that my son would sleep during the day, and I would just sleep at the same time. This was not to be&#8230;..Though my husband was gone during the day, everytime I tried to sleep, my mother-in-law would make me get up to do household chores, even ironing my new husband&#39;s underwear and socks. I was in a state of total exhaustion, and the few times during the night my son would finally sleep, my husband would try to strangle me to death, as he had just returned from Vietnam, had PTSD, would dream I was a prostitute trying to kill him, and he earnestly felt he was trying to survive death. I did not just have Post Partum Depression, EVEN SO, PROPER TREATMENT AND SUPPORT HEALED ME !!!!! Do NOT be afraid. Of course to save the life of my son, and myself, I fled the violence and frequent danger of death. Post Partum Depression is terrible, but it DOES go away with therapy and medications. Talking about really helps, and there is probably a support group, locally (some that you can bring your baby to). Never fear, God loves you, and will help you through this.<br />   Your baby, June is beautiful and well worth the effort it takes to seek help. God Bless you, Dear. Love, Mary.</p>

      <p>I had postpartum depression for a year after my baby was born. I was never diagnosed, but was so glad to have figured it out and have an explanation for feeling so down that first year. Thank you for sharing your story.</p>
<p>I have to say, June is an exceptionally adorable baby! Congratulations!</p>

      <p>Kudos to you for sharing.  I&#39;m not a mom myself, but I&#39;ve often wondered why everyone doesn&#39;t go through that &#8211; so much is changing and so much is new once you have a kid.  Take care of yourself and know that you don&#39;t have it do it all alone &#8211; don&#39;t be afraid to lean on others.  I bet putting a name to it must have been such a relief.

      <p>Oh Molly, I&#39;m sorry you are having a difficult time.  It will pass.  It will.  When I first had my son some of the best advice I had was to give myself permission to let go of everything else and just focus on being a mama, because it&#39;s a hard job and is more than enough!  Your baby is the most important thing right now (and that is okay!)  As women we can be pulled in so many directions and be so overwhelmed.  I don&#39;t know if you are feeling that way, but since  that advice helped me I thought I&#39;d pass it to you.  Enjoy your gorgeous, sweet little love.</p>

      <p>I did not have postpartum depression.  I had a major depression for the first six months of my second pregnancy.  I cried and yelled and shouted and said and wished for some very horrible things.  Then one day it was as if someone had lifted a shade and let in the beautiful light of great love and joy.  I remember those feelings very well.  My daughter was born with a birth defect and has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome.  The guilt I felt after her birth was huge.  I blamed myself and how I felt those first six months of pregnancy.  I realize that none of this was my fault but those feelings were very real and I will always acknowledge them.  I was thankful to have people close to me that I could talk to and I am so happy that you have the same.  You are never alone.  Many blessings to you and your wonderful family.  Stay strong and keep faith in knowing this will pass and your love will be even bigger.   </p>

      <p>Molly. I wish we could go have a coffee. I&#39;m not sure if you ever read my blog during early motherhood but I get it. Like you, I wanted to hear from other women who got it, from someone who would stop telling me to sleep when the baby slept because I couldn&#39;t, for people to stop telling me to cherish every moment when so many moments were so scary, and yes, to hear that it gets better.</p>
<p>Listen, it gets better. I won&#39;t say when exactly because I spent a whole hell of a lot of time waiting for a magic week or month when it would suddenly be 100% awesome all the time. It didn&#39;t get magically better at any particular week, but it got incrementally easier and easier and easier and more and more normal. The sleep eventually came back. And then one day you look back and realize you are in a very different, much better place.</p>
<p>I have a lot to say about this, anytime. And hey, I know from experience how good it can be to have friends in other time zones on those lonely sleepless nights.</p>

      <p>I also have some trouble with depression though a very low dose of Effexor has helped. It&#39;s difficult to explain to someone who doesn&#39;t have it since we think of sadness, but really, everything is OK. Depression for me is about being overwhelmed and feeling like I can&#39;t do anything&#8211;going to the store for cat food feels impossible, for example. I appreciate your honesty about this. </p>

      <p>I just hope you continue to talk about it, seek out support and help, and realize it will pass. Maybe not as quick as you want, but one day it will go away. You will wake up and it will be gone and you will feel a sense of freedom and weight lifted. Mine was horribly severe after my third and I felt so alone &#8211; because for some reason it is not the easiest to share and I didn&#39;t tell a soul. Not my family, not my friends. I didn&#39;t want people asking me how I was every second of the day. And I look back at that period and I think &#8220;whoa&#8221;, I should of asked for help. I should of told someone &#8211; maybe it wouldn&#39;t of lasted as long as it did. Being a mom consumes and we forget to take time for ourselves. I think if anything, the best thing is to just take time to yourself when you can. Get outside and breathe, go to the store by yourself. Sounds silly, but man I love going grocery shopping by myself. 🙂</p>

      <p>Ah ha, indeed.  I had a very similar experience.  And I said to a friend on Friday morning, &#39;I know I have never met Molly, but something in the way she has been quiet and in the way she&#39;s written the few posts since June is familiar to me.  I think something is up and I think it might be ppd.&#39; I was going to try to email you, to say hello.  And say, just in case, me too.  I&#39;m glad you are getting help and that it is, in fact, helpful.  I am cheering you on.  I hope you&#39;ll write about it. I find that has helped me.  <br />Blessings and wholeheartedness to you and baby June. And I really, really hope to meet you some day.<br />xo &#8211; Margaret and baby Ruby</p>

      <p>Just chiming in&#8230;.sometimes what helps is sheer volume. My cousin was diagnosed with post partum psychosis manifesting as mania and was hospitalized for a short time.

      <p>I&#39;m so glad you trust us all enough to share.  Even without postpartum depression, many women just seem to feel like they can&#39;t admit that things aren&#39;t always gloriously perfect when you have a baby.  It is hard.

      <p>Molly, thank you. Thank you. I have been a long-time reader, but never commented. My daughter was born within a few days of your gorgeous June, and I too have been suffering with PPD/PPA for two months now. It also manifested itself &#8211; to start &#8211; as insomnia. Not sleeping when everyone else is (including the baby I&#39;d just spent two hours trying desperately to get to sleep) made me feel so terribly lonely. Those long, dark hours were some of the worst of my life, followed closely by the isolation of the days after bad nights, being trapped in my house as I didn&#39;t trust myself to drive anywhere on no sleep. Though every new mama&#39;s situation is different, I just wanted to say that I understand, and thank you so very much for being strong enough and brave enough to write about it. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re getting support, and glad (to quote Zoe Bartlett from the West Wing), that the help is helping. Hang in there.</p>

      <p>oh, my dear. SO glad you wrote it down. This is the real stuff. The stuff that connects you to others and makes this weird blogging thing worthwhile.

      <p>PPD kicked my ass, for the first ~5 months of my baby&#39;s life.  It hit me while I was still in the hospital &#8211; they wouldn&#39;t let me check out because I couldn&#39;t stop crying.  It took months but IT DID END.  I didn&#39;t take meds &#8211; a decision I made with my doc &#8211; but if I feel the same way about my next future hypothetical baby, I probably will. PPD sucks, and it&#39;s hard, and I cried so, so much, but it got better.  It really did.  The baby&#39;s 10 months old and just a delight and I feel SO MUCH BETTER that there aren&#39;t even words.  Good luck to you, and your adorable little girl.   </p>

      <p>I&#39;d wager the statistic would be higher than 1 in 10 if PPD were talked about more openly. I had my daughter in August and am just now starting to feel normal again. I felt totally in-over-my-head and terribly isolated staying at home by myself all day with a newborn but everyone told me it was just the &#8220;baby blues.&#8221; I&#39;m glad to hear that you&#39;re starting to feel better and thanks so much for your honesty.</p>

      <p>Molly-I so feel you on everything you said. I have a 9 month old and while I haven&#39;t been diagnosed with PPD the insomnia and anxiety that circle around me, coming and going, are enough to empathize so much. You are brave for posting this and I have found a lot of comfort in reading the comments of others&#8211;so thank you for that! It is so so good to hear from others on the &#8220;other side&#8221;, and to feel a little less alone in this crazy world of early motherhood. Even with a very strong support system it is hard to see the &#8220;it will get better!&#8221; through the fog some days. </p>

      <p>Holly,<br />As I am trying to give my toddler his morning tea, I HAD to respond to your comment. I have been there. Consumed by anxiety and worrying about the future and things that we simply cannot control. It is a strange feeling to be so in love with your baby and yet so simply overwhelmed by them &#8211; I can so relate to that! Just know Holly, that like Carol said, this too shall pass. One day you will go out with June and think to yourself, today is a great day! It WILL happen. You have got onto your PND early and that is great. Be kind to yourself and do whatever you need to do to get back on track and be the mum you so want to be. I know you are already doing a brilliant job, you just need to believe it! Love Kate x</p>

      <p>Thank you for sharing. I did not have postpartum, but my mom did, and so have many of my friends. I did have a week of depression right before I gave birth, and it is scary and unsettling and I felt guilty for not being excited about my child. But it is important to get help, and I&#39;m so glad you did, for yourself and for June, and I&#39;m so glad you shared your story for all the other moms out there that have experienced this. For any mom out there fighting post partum, you are strong and brave and a wonderful mom because you are taking care of yourself. 🙂</p>

      <p>Thank you for this and all your lovely writing.  Blessings on the courage to speak up and find community and comfort, and on mamas and babies all over the world. Please, all of you with a suspicion or a diagnosis of PPD or just plain D, and those of you with babies generally, please pretty please get your thyroid levels checked.  Simple bloodwork.  Most insurance covers it.  PPD (and plain D) and thyroid disorders are hard to tell apart in the dark, and can both produce quite a lot of dark&#8211;both are common and too often overlooked (new mamas, for example, are supposed to be tired or wired or out of sorts, goes the &#39;wisdom&#39;) and can be made so so so much better when they are handled.

      <p>A very thoughtful, helpful post, as I am certain that one of the great difficulties with PPD is feeling like it shouldn&#39;t be happening&#8211; I mean you have an incredibly gorgeous baby, and a wonderful partner and what the heck, isn&#39;t everything supposed to be sunshine and rainbows?

      <p>This is a piece of writing that you can be proud about for the rest of your life. Thank you for once again sharing &#39;your best stuff&#39; with us. And, yes, as so many people have said, the motherhood thing does get so much better. I have struggled with it for sure.  And when my second was not sleeping and I was working in a restaurant at night after mothering all day, often on 3 hours of sleep,  it seemed like everything was falling apart. But it wasn&#39;t! Things are much better now and I am so in love with both my girls it hurts.<br />And June &#8212; well, she is simply remarkable. Those eyes look right through you, and then the mouth that looks about to smile a droll smile&#8230;. Remarkable. What a person. Please don&#39;t hesitate to post more photos.<br />And one more thing to maybe make you feel better &#8212; the Kim Boyce Cereal banana muffins!!! Yes!! We have made them over and over. My household thanks you. When I had a housefull of toddlers here for play group one time, several of the kids ate like FIVE mini-muffins apiece. I was as thrilled as their mothers were vaguely embarrassed! </p>

      <p>Molly dear.  I have not had PPD, but I have suffered from relentless major depression since I was 4 (am <br />now 59).  I can honestly say that I would not be alive <br />without antidepressants.  So don&#39;t be afraid of <br />medication, and know that with treatment and<br />support , this too will pass.  As for Miss June-Bug, it<br />is very obvious from the photograph that this little<br />one is THRIVING.  So don&#39;t worry about your having<br />PPD hurting your baby &#8211; she is fine.  Just go ahead and do what you need to do, and one day (soon, I <br />hope!) the sun will shine again.  Much Love, Susan</p>

      <p>Sarah, I read your comment and immediately identified. I am newly pregnant now and terrified. Is it worth it? Does the foxy to frumpy change (physical and spiritual) reverse?

      <p>Thank you for your honesty and bravery! I had ppd after my second child and told myself for way way way too long &#8220;it will get better, just keep trying and it will get better&#8221;. I still see pics of those times and its all a fog. I wouldn&#39;t remember a lot of it if there weren&#39;t pictures to remind me of things we did and places we went. Such dark days, overwhelmed doesn&#39;t begin to describe. Antidepressants helped me get my feet back under me and eventually I discovered I also had hypothyroid.  Wouldn&#39;t hurt to get that checked if you haven&#39;t already. As soon as I discovered and treated that, it was like the lights came back on! Life was still busy but manageable.

      <p>I have to join the chorus of &#8220;thank you&#8221;s. I started following your blog just before I became pregnant with our first, and he was born four days after June. He is beautiful, healthy, hilarious, and everything we ever dared to wish for, my husband is wonderful, our life is great, and I also recently had to admit that I was being sucked under by PPD. It&#39;s humbling, and at first I was really ashamed.   It&#39;s been so helpful to me to hear from other moms about their dark moments, to be reassured that I&#39;m not alone and that I&#39;m not a terrible person for not being happy all the time. </p>
<p>Your daughter is gorgeous. She loves you and knows you love her.  Congratulations on being such a wonderful mother that you were strong enough to get help. </p>

      <p>Hi Molly,</p>
<p>PEPS is really big in Seattle, and although most moms/couples sign up before birth, I highly recommend trying to get into a group. It is a group of families who have babies born within a few weeks of each other in your neighborhood. A facilitator forms groups based on birth dates, and you meet once a week to discuss a given topic, or anything you need. Resources and support are right there for you. My experience with two different PEPS groups is that if you need outside resources, there is support for that as well.</p>

      <p>I have never had a child, which is a whole other subject for review/reason to feel bad, so while I cannot fully understand your feelings, I thank you for sharing them.  Your book touched a lot of feelings in me about the loss of my father and knowing that someone else was having a similar experience was a blessing.  I hope that sharing was for you then and can be again a source of blessing, as is that beautiful baby.  May you find peace as your body acclimates to new and different jobs and may your mind find an equilibrium in the many new things it is called on to do.  Blessings on you and yours and thank you for the gift of sharing.  </p>

      <p>I cannot tell you how glad I was to read this post.  </p>
<p>My son is only six weeks old, and I&#39;ve felt totally blindsided by the onslaught of emotions I&#39;ve been feeling.  I remember people talking about how hard it is, but no one ever told me that I would feel totally betrayed by myself, my emotions, my hormones.  Now that I&#39;ve opened up to other mom friends about how rough of a go I&#39;ve been having I&#39;ve heard so many stories that sound just like mine.  But, I feel like we should be talking about it ahead of time.  So, thank you.  Thank you for your openness and honesty.  It&#39;s really so crucial to know that you&#39;re not alone.</p>
<p>And, yeah, she really is adorable.</p>

It feels wrong and you feel guilty and stupid and useless and a burden and so on and so forth. Silly human brain!!!</p>

      <p>Molly, well said as always. I think the hardest part is asking for help or even acknowledging there is a problem. My daughters are 13 &#038; 15, last year we decided we needed some guidance through the teen years. It wasn&#39;t easy (especially for my husband, it seems men want to fix everything without help!)

      <p>Molly, I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your ppd.  But glad to hear you are getting treatment and feeling much better.  I know that depression is treatable since I have experienced it and been successfully treated.  Now depression is mostly in the past for me. Psychologists helped me and also a very good book called Happiness is a Choice by Minirth Meyer.  It is excellent for anyone who might experience depression and was truly a lifesaver to me.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m so sorry that you&#39;re having to go through this, and so appreciate your sharing.  I remember the first time I had to put down a child and go into the bathroom so I wouldn&#39;t just THROW her away from me, thinking I was a terrible mother.  But then I found out that is NORMAL (the wanting to throw, not doing it!).  It&#39;s a hard enough gig without the PPD.   Who knows how many women you&#39;ve helped today. Thank you, and I hope it doesn&#39;t last much longer!</p>

      <p>Hi Molly! I just wanted to send words of support and humor and patience and hope and, eventually, laughter and peace. Your soul is beautiful and your heart is strong &#8211; stronger than the hormones, I promise! You, like thousands of other women before you, can and will get through this. It&#39;s normal, and it&#39;s temporary. I&#39;m so glad Brandon is such a source of support, and that June is SO beautiful. </p>

      <p>Hi Sarah, your baby is beautiful. I just want to say taht as usual, your writing is so honest and simple &#8212; yet powerful. I love it. While it has been some time since I gave birth to my son (he&#39;s 21 and the time flew by), becoming a mother is an overwhelming experience with mostly joy but also a lot of mixed feelings. Take it slow and the thing that always helped me was to think to myself: this feeling (moment), the baby crying, whatever it is&#8230;will pass.<br />Good Luck.</p>

      <p>I just wanted to thank you for writing this- I suspect that I too had postpartum depression after my first daughter was born 11 years ago. Also, she was kind of a sucky infant. (She is now quite lovely&#8230;..) You are brave to write about this, and I know you will improve and come out on the other side. I always tell my friends that if I knew ahead of time what each day would bring, (in terms of children/caretaking/stitches/worries), I would never get out of bed. And yet,we do. </p>

      <p>Molly, I have not had PPD, although it is something I worry about, being pregnant with my first baby now. However, I have struggled with depression and anxiety for my entire life. When I start to feel overwhelmed and that panic-y feeling starts to set in, I find that it helps to remind myself that the anxiety lies to me. Depression and anxiety make you feel things that are untrue or things that are extreme exagerations of the truth. They are lying liars who lie and, while it doesn&#39;t take the panic attacks away, reminding myself of that does help me put them into perspective. You are very brave. It has been my experience that no one wants to discuss the emotional roller coaster that is pregnancy (and I&#39;m sure the same goes for giving birth and the aftermath of that birth&#8230;I will find that part out shortly). Most people want to say that pregnancy is a glowing, wonderful experience (or share their nightmare birthing story). No one wants to say the truth &#8211; that it is hard work and some days it takes all of my energy just to get out of bed in the morning. I&#39;m not complaining&#8230;I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way, but the truth of the matter is that this process is hard: pysically and emotionally. Women deserve medals&#8230;you deserve a medal. Thank you for your bravery.</p>

      <p>Oh my WORD is June gorgeous.  Those eyes!</p>
<p>I am so happy you&#39;re getting help for your PPD.  I had it, and for whatever reason I was too stubborn (and <i>stupid!</i>) to have it diagnosed &#8211; and it was awful. But it passed, and then my residual anger at myself for being so stupid passed, and now my new year&#39;s baby just turned six and I cannot believe how happy I am. </p>
<p>Did I mention how beautiful June is?  Wowsers.</p>

      <p>Oh what a pretty baby. THAT HAIR!!  I&#39;m so glad you have gotten the help you need and figured out the cause of your insomnia.  As the mama of a 4.5 month-old myself, I know what a topsy-turvy life changer the birth of your first baby is. Whew is right! They just don&#39;t tell you that the first week of your baby&#39;s life will be the WORST week of your life (at least it was for me)!  <br />Hang in there sweet mama!</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been thinking of you during this time and wondering how you were doing. May sound strange since I only know you from your blog and book, but I&#39;ve been wishing you well and hoping that you are making it through this crazy ride. I too went through depression after my amazing daughter was born six months ago. I would walk my daughter around the neighborhood in the Ergo just crying for no reason and every reason all at once. I felt so alone, even with friends I could call and an amazingly supportive husband. It took me some time to really trust and believe that things would change, repeating over and over, &#8220;This too shall pass&#8221; and &#8220;Be brave and kind&#8221;. And now here I sit  on my couch drinking coffee and catching up on blogs while my daughter is in the other room and should be napping but instead is practicing all the silly, new noises she has learned. And I smile and am grateful that I have come out the other end of that difficult tunnel. </p>
<p>I will continue to send you positive energy. Take good care of yourself. That June is sure a lucky and beautiful little lady. </p>

      <p>Molly, I check many of my favorite food blogs regularly but have never offered a comment until now.  I was never officially diagnosed with PPD but I was probably very close to it.  I also wasn&#39;t sad but more&#8230;scared.  I was scared of this tiny creature who wouldn&#39;t let me sleep.  It was a strange feeling that was hard to reconcile.  My husband was also having a very difficult time adjusting and was probably also suffering from a form of PPD.  My doctor perscribed antidepresents for me but I never used them.  I was afraid of feeling more disconnected than I already was.  I came out of it on my own and by three months my son and I were two peas in a pod and nine years later, we still are. </p>

      <p>It is so normal. I had it with both of my children, but it was much worse with my second child. The kicker for me was that I has such a hard time conceiving that it seemed a cruel joke to be left feeling so depleted when all that I had longed for had finally come to fruition.</p>
<p>It is imperative to get and accept the help&#8230; and you will come out on the other side so much stronger than you can imagine. But&#8230;you will take many tiny steps, forward and back, until you find the right groove.</p>

      <p>I am relatively new to your blog, Molly, in part because I am entering a stage of life far different from your own and one that is finally offering me the time to do things like read blogs. My children are nearning the end of their teenage years. As I read about your life with a newborn, it brings me back to that overwhelming time of life as a new parent when my life entirely revolved around my children. Yes, babies are adorable and miraculous, but they are also a hell of a lot of work. Judging by the insight you show in your writing, I am guessing that you will work your way through this with your own personal grace and with the help of loved ones. Parenting is a journey that has challenged me physically and emotionally like nothing else. At the same time, I have never gained so much from any other aspect of my life. Thank you for sharing with such honesty.</p>

      <p>You already have a staggering amount of helpful, heart-felt comments on this post, brave lady, and I hesitate to add one more.  But this is important, for as much as I read about this, I never read this.  I fell into PPD, and I eventually broke through the surface, and life was bright and shiny again.  And then my husband fell under.  NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THIS.  Men are not immune, and it was only as as I got better that he started to fall, and it took us an unforgivably long time to figure it out and start to make it better.  So bravo, thank you so much for adding your voice, please please be vigilant about your own health, but also that of your partner.  I&#39;ll keep all three of you in my thoughts.</p>

      <p>Hello Molly,<br />to me the thing about writing is that, in a weird way, it helps me to make sense of what I often find difficult to understand. It helps me thinking, to make my own thesis, antithesis and synthesis of a subject, and even though it doesn&#39;t solves a problem, I feel that it helps me to put it where it belongs.<br />I know that&#39;s irrelevant for your problem, but don&#39;t stop writing, don&#39;t think about what you&#39;re going to write about or how you&#39;re going to do it. If you need, do it however it will come out. <br />(Besides I really like it the way you do it.)</p>
<p>Being someone who already had a depression, I can tell you everything as a solution, but I guess you know that, as you wrote it in the end. And a piece of cake and some cookies are always welcome to go along the way! 😉 Just don&#39;t isolate yourself, even if that&#39;s all you want to do sometimes.</p>
<p>I wish you, Brandon and June all the best.<br />Catarina </p>

      <p>My first comment. You are human! I bet it&#39;s more than 1 in 10 but that women either don&#39;t realize what is going on (they just think they are tired, etc.) or don&#39;t ask for help. </p>
<p>But my god, June is gorgeous. She deserves a mommy who takes care of herself. </p>

      <p>I feel for you on this journey, Molly.  I can&#39;t help wondering this, though &#8212; is it just hormones?  Or is your body/mind telling you something true?  Perhaps you feel overwhelmed because you ARE overwhelmed?  You&#39;ve just opened a new restaurant, you have a book coming out and a Web site to attend to, payrolls to meet and bills to pay, and oh yes, a baby who&#39;s utterly dependent on you for her survival.  And you&#39;re doing all this on very little sleep, I have to assume.  No wonder it&#39;s all coming apart.  So.  Do you have enough help?  Can you get more?  Can you stop doing some things?  Can you remake your life for the next 6 months and just do June?  Some people are born multi-taskers but others &#8212; artists, mostly &#8212; are not.  Artists need to focus. Artists need clarity and alone-time and breathing space and all the things you&#39;re not getting.  So anyway, I hope you can simplify where you can and get help where you can&#39;t.  xx</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve especially loved reading your blog this year, since I had a baby about three months before you, and when I read you I KNOW, because I was just there.  And I was just there.  I was reorganizing all the out-grown baby clothes today, and folding those little newborn oneies left me feeling&#8230;devastatingly overwhelmed, which is so much how I felt when he was wearing them.  Like I just wanted to hide my head in a hole and hope everything turned out okay while I wasn&#39;t looking.  But it gets better.  Now he is such a funny little person, with a sense of humor and a funny personality, and things are just SO MUCH BETTER. </p>
<p>You are doing an awesome job, and that beautiful little girl is lucky to have you as her mama.</p>

      <p>Dear Molly,<br />Thank you for your courage in sharing so honestly. And what a gift it is that you have been diagnosed and can ask and will receive help and support. <br />I promise you that it will get better. I had no idea until I finally emerged into the light that I had suffered from PPD for several months. Crying jags, feeling completely overwhelmed, feeling guilty about those feelings. And you are armed with knowledge and support, so you will most hopefully get through this in the near future. And the other side is a wonderful thing, indeed. It&#39;s not always easy, but I am much more present and savoring the joyful moments all the more. Best to you all! Peggy</p>

      <p>Molly,<br />I&#39;m so sorry to hear you are going through a tough time. I know you will get through this. You should be proud of yourself for getting the help you need. I can&#39;t even imagine how life changing it is to have children. </p>
<p>I recently read your book and loved it!! I made the tomato soup and it was delicious. I also made the shredded cabbage salad. Now all I want to do is go to a Buchon and I found one in Miami! <br />June is such a beautiful baby.</p>

      <p>Molly, many kudos to you for seeking help.  My little guy is just 5 months old (and has his two bottom teeth coming in already!!) and I easily, EASILY, remember that feeling of overwhelm&#8230;and I wasn&#39;t trying to run a bar and restaurant with hubby along with raising my baby and minding the dogs.  So KUDOS to you, girl, for getting help and for talking about it here.  June is the most precious little thing -I&#39;m sure she wants a happy momma as much as you want a happy baby.  = )</p>

      <p>This was a brave post to write and bravo to you for doing so and also for recognizing that you needed to get help.  I definitely suffered from postpartum depression but could not see it for what it was at the time.  Because of that, I suffered more than I needed to and for a longer period of time.  I wish you wellness and happiness during this challenging time.</p>

      <p>Bravo on the soul bearing. June is a beauty! I&#39;m a Chicago native, but we got to live in Seattle May &#39;11-May &#39;12. My 1st baby was just 3 mos old when we moved out there, and I was so discombobulated with all of it (all of it!) that I can count our Seattle-area foodie outings on one hand (travesty). Delancey was first on the list and the best. I recall waiting for our table on a gorgeous, sunshiny evening somewhere in the haze between summer and fall. We still dream of it, the anchovy and olive pie especially. Sending you lots of positive energy in hopes you&#39;ll be back up and running before you know it. Keep on keepin&#39; on, Molly.</p>

      <p>From one new mother in Ballard to another, thank you for scraping together the time to write and share. (Honestly, this simple response to your post has been interrupted twice already!) My tiny human was born in June ( and I actually wanted to name her June, except for the timing). Life will never be the same, will it. I remember feeling jealous of your previous post about squeezing in a date with your husband, even a Sunday day date for one hour. Nothing is easy anymore, but I too am learning to ask for and accept help, and to pay better attention to my own emotions and needs. Your post is awesome and thank you for finding the courage to share so personally. Should you find a wild-eyed new mom roaming the streets near your restaurant with a baby strapped to her front, wave hello, and know that you are not alone. </p>

      <p>She is an unbelievably beautiful baby. Molly, I got goosebumps reading this post.  It reminded me of what I lived through 12 years ago when my daughter was born.  She was an unbelievably beautiful baby like June.  Really.  (People would see her picture and ask &#8220;Is she really that beautiful in person?&#8221;) And I loved her with all my heart.  And from the moment she was born, I was certain I could be superwoman.  I wanted to be the best mother that ever walked the earth.  But, from the moment she became colickly  everything seemed so hard.  Perhaps I wasn&#39;t emotionally prepared for how difficult parenthood really is.  I was very young, just a year out of college.  But then there was also juggling a new marriage, selling a home, buying a home, renovating a home, moving to a new part of town, searching for something familiar and never finding it anywhere I looked.  That&#39;s how it felt.  And in all that was new, there was so little that was reassuring.  I remember going to see a doctor to figure out if I need to be medicated.  When I listed all the major life changes we were going through, she said, I don&#39;t necessarily think there is anything wrong with you.  I think you are dealing with a lot of MAJOR life changes, and any person in your shoes would feel overwhelmed.  It was reassuring to hear that it was normal to feel overwhelmed.  My motto became &#8220;Fake it &#39;til you make it.&#8221;  That was how I survived my daughter&#39;s infancy and baby years.  I look back now (12 years and another child &#8211; son &#8211; later) at pictures of when she was a radiant baby (she is now a gorgeous young lady), and I can&#39;t believe that her unbelievable radiance didn&#39;t just buoy me through the days.  That her adorable face and smile wasn&#39;t enough to make me realize that I WAS doing a great job and I WAS a good, make that great, mother.  But that&#39;s what postpartum depression does.  It distorts reality and you just don&#39;t believe that there is anything good around you.  Thank goodness for pictures and cameras, to help capture some of that reality for posterity.  I know you will come through this stronger than ever, and I wish I could give you a hug through the virtual etherworld and tell you, from someone who has been there &#8211; that you are an amazing mom; June loves you and needs you and you are doing a great job.</p>

<p>As always, thank you for sharing Molly. This post is a reminder that Orangette is really the best food blog around because food is more or less life and there are few people who write about it as profoundly as you.</p>

      <p>Dear Molly, I read your blog right after you read it and was hoping that you would find strength and support in the comments from others. Tonight I read through some of them and hope you feel the love and support as well as hope from your followers. You have such a gift with words and June has such a gift of a great mom. Take care!</p>

      <p>Bravo for you, Molly, for seeking help in all forms. Though I have not had children myself, many of my friends have, and SEVERAL of them have had PPD with one pregnancy. All have had different experiences. You are NOT alone! And&#8230; June is seriously the most adorable baby ever. What a CUTIE! Thanks for posting, even in the not so great moments!</p>

      <p>I didn&#39;t recognize it after my first, but was hit doubly hard after weaning my second. I work 60+ hours a week and travel quite a bit for work, and I had a really really hard time admitting that I needed help.

<p>Postpartum depression is a terrifying thing. But on the other side of the abyss everything is in a sharper focus, the colors are more brilliant and the moments seem even sweeter.

      <p>Oh my dear Molly, I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;ve been suffering.  It will get better, you&#39;ll start sleeping through the night, instead of in your car and that adorable baby of yours will make your heart expand even more than it already has.  I had to laugh when I read the opening lines of your post because my little baby is now a mopey teenager and she&#39;s writing a lot (there may be a long-haired boy at the heart of the matter), yet it seems like just yesterday I was a mopey new mother.  I&#39;ve just published a book called Ruminations from the Minivan, musings from a world grown large, then small, about this transformation.  In the next few weeks I&#39;ll deliver a copy for you to Delancey.  I want you to have it because a post you once wrote about Marcella Hazen&#39;s tomato sauce with onion and butter inspired my writing.  The community of mothers can be so comforting.  Hope my little book provides some comfort to you.</p>

      <p>Molly, </p>
<p>I, too, am a loyal reader who has never commented. And one who has suffered greatly after having her first child. My baby is 9 months old now, and for about 2 months I have felt normal. I had forgotten how it felt, and never thought I&#39;d experience it again. It is wonderful, and it does come. I had times when I wanted to hurt myself, my child, when I wanted to leave and run away, times paralyzed with anxiety or depression, when I thought I just couldn&#39;t make it,and always hating myself for all of it. I had a huge support system, as obviously, you do, too. Use that support system, go get massages, take walks, have a drink, go to yoga. whatever YOU need to do, that is what is best for june right now. Don&#39;t compare yourself to other moms who cook bouef bourgignon with a baby to their breast while wearing high heels. It helped me to know that I just needed to be ME and do what was best for my family. I can&#39;t imagine that you&#39;d have time to read all of these comments, but I at least write this to the others like me, who with blurred, teary vision, sit and read everyone&#39;s beautiful words of hope and community. xoxo THANK YOU, MOLLY, for everything. we love you.</p>

I can&#39;t imagine that you&#39;d have time to read all of these comments, but I at least write this to the others like me, who with blurred, teary vision, sit and read everyone&#39;s beautiful words of hope and community. xoxo THANK YOU, MOLLY, for everything. we love you.</p>

      <p>Molly,<br />I have never, ever commented. I read your book years ago and my mom and and I pass your recipes back and forth religiously. I have a 6 year old and 2 year old and I, too, struggled with post partum depression with both of my children. I did not want to admit it and let the depression turn into other complicated emotions because i felt somehow I was stronger than these feelings and could overcome. I have learned now, through a few sessions of counseling to untangle all the emotions I was feeling, a few deep breaths, one major breakdown sobbing on my staircase, and a whole lot of introspection that babies are hard and so is life. It is breathtakingly wonderful, but it is hard. It is also true that hormones are SO crazy but for me, the wonderful birth of my beautiful, healthy children unlocked a lot of grief. I write these words to comfort you because I can hardly articulate the deep sense of peace, security and assurance I now feel about my present and my future as well as my role as a mother. It does get better. I am glad you sought help. If I can offer one more piece of advice, please don&#39;t beat yourself up about it and while it may be hard, please listen to your emotions (although ignore any lies in there of unworthiness or being a bad mother! those are lies my friend). Grief and joy are so intricately woven together. I say these words as gently and humbly as possible and only with the intention of encouraging you. You seem to be an incredibly thoughtful, kind person and I know you will be okay. Please know there are many of us rooting for you and many, many of us women who have experienced similar feelings. Take good care dear Molly and xoxox to June,<br />Ann</p>

      <p>Hi Molly, </p>
<p>I&#39;m a sister-in-arms. I&#39;ve experienced post-partum depression twice. </p>
<p>There are many different ways to get help and help yourself and all of them are good. What was most beneficial to me was the philosophy of self-help of the Pacific Postpartum Support Society (up the road from you here, in Vancouver BC). I began to engineer a plan for myself to recover, and that sense of agency was the most important step. My personal plan started with maximizing my sleep, by any means necessary. I also addressed nutrition, including supplementing with vitamin D and omega-3s. I also made sure to get time to exercise a little bit. I saw a cognitive behavioural counsellor. The second time around I attended a support group for women with postpartum depression. I was initially afraid of sharing my feelings in an environment like that, but it actually became a huge bright point to organize my week around. Thinking a lot about motherhood also helped (I&#39;m more of an intellectual and less of an intuitive) &#8212; especially thinking of it as a marathon for which I had no training. It was bound to be very very difficult at first, but as I went on, with the right supports in place, I would adapt and become more adept. For some of my fellow support group attendees, weaning, anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medications, vacations, yoga, massage, etc. were very helpful.</p>
<p>The most important strategy for dealing with postpartum depression, for me &#8212; and this is what the group facilitator emphasized for all of us &#8212; was to make a self-care plan each week. What did I need: company? a food treat? time to read, all alone? yoga? A shower? A pedicure? A walk by the oceans? And then the task is to get these things.</p>
<p>The other most important thing to know is that this IS temporary. It feels like it goes on forever and forever and forever, but it will not last forever. You will have some better days, and then those better days will become good days, and then those good days will outnumber the bad ones. You may find that all of a sudden you&#39;re feeling worse than before, but it&#39;ll just be a dip on the road to recovering yourself. </p>
<p>You&#39;ve probably already found this: <a href="http://www.ppmdsupport.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.ppmdsupport.com/</a> and if you&#39;re able to read more, I highly recommend PostPartum Depression for Dummies. (available as an ebook through Seattle Public Library <a href="http://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2440602030_postpartum_depression_for_dummies" rel="nofollow ugc">http://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2440602030_postpartum_depression_for_dummies</a>) </p>
<p>My heart is with you. You&#39;re the best mother for your baby and you are all going to be okay. </p>
<p>With love,</p>
<p>Heather </p>

      <p>Hi Molly, </p>
<p>I&#39;m a sister-in-arms. I&#39;ve experienced post-partum depression twice. </p>
<p>There are many different ways to get help and help yourself and all of them are good. What was most beneficial to me was the philosophy of self-help of the Pacific Postpartum Support Society (up the road from you here, in Vancouver BC). I began to engineer a plan for myself to recover, and that sense of agency was the most important step. My personal plan started with maximizing my sleep, by any means necessary. I also addressed nutrition, including supplementing with vitamin D and omega-3s. I also made sure to get time to exercise a little bit. I saw a cognitive behavioural counsellor. The second time around I attended a support group for women with postpartum depression. I was initially afraid of sharing my feelings in an environment like that, but it actually became a huge bright point to organize my week around. Thinking a lot about motherhood also helped (I&#39;m more of an intellectual and less of an intuitive) &#8212; especially thinking of it as a marathon for which I had no training. It was bound to be very very difficult at first, but as I went on, with the right supports in place, I would adapt and become more adept. For some of my fellow support group attendees, weaning, anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medications, vacations, yoga, massage, etc. were very helpful.</p>
<p>The most important strategy for dealing with postpartum depression, for me &#8212; and this is what the group facilitator emphasized for all of us &#8212; was to make a self-care plan each week. What did I need: company? a food treat? time to read, all alone? yoga? A shower? A pedicure? A walk by the oceans? And then the task is to get these things.</p>
<p>The other most important thing to know is that this IS temporary. It feels like it goes on forever and forever and forever, but it will not last forever. You will have some better days, and then those better days will become good days, and then those good days will outnumber the bad ones. You may find that all of a sudden you&#39;re feeling worse than before, but it&#39;ll just be a dip on the road to recovering yourself. </p>
<p>You&#39;ve probably already found this: <a href="http://www.ppmdsupport.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.ppmdsupport.com/</a> and if you&#39;re able to read more, I highly recommend PostPartum Depression for Dummies. (available as an ebook through Seattle Public Library <a href="http://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2440602030_postpartum_depression_for_dummies" rel="nofollow ugc">http://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2440602030_postpartum_depression_for_dummies</a>) </p>
<p>My heart is with you. You&#39;re the best mother for your baby and you are all going to be okay. </p>
<p>With love,</p>
<p>Heather </p>

      <p>Molly, thank you for speaking out.  I am just weaning myself off my medication (my son is now 6 months old). I really struggled with PPD, and at my 6 week checkup could hardly speak to my doc without crying.  That is when we both knew I needed more than just a hug or some superfood.  Even though you are warned about it, you don’t think that it will happen to you.  It’s like drowning in a strong current; it can really catch you off guard and suck you under very fast.  The most important thing for me was realizing that it was not wrong or shameful to ask for help.  In fact, that is the best thing to do.  Even now, as I am finally feeling like myself again and thoroughly able to enjoy my son, it really helps to read through these comments.  I wish you strength and joy!  </p>

      <p>Thank you for this post, you&#39;re right there is not enough talk about PP Depression.  As a midwife, I feel like the numbers are even higher than what statistics say, unfortunately.

      <p>I didn&#39;t realize I had postpartum depression until my baby was about one year old. I started coming out of that strange, horrible fog and started to realize &#8220;oh&#8230; that wasn&#39;t normal.&#8221; I&#39;m glad you&#39;re getting help sooner. I used to feel so confused because it was supposed to be natural, right? Like our bodies are biologically designed to conceive, labor, birth, feed, etc. but sometimes (most times?) it feel so incredibly unnatural. and hard. anyway, I wish you the best! My baby is now almost five, and it&#39;s incredible to me how much my heart just grows and grows everyday.</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been reading you for years, your writing really resonates with me. This time, too: overwhelmed says it all. A long time has passed, my oldest son is now almost 14, but I vividly remember the despair of those first months. It helps when you finally surrender to the loss of control and the invasion of your thinking time. I believe it&#39;s a kind of mourning for the person you were. And while it&#39;s true that you will never be exactly the same, you will find yourself again, sooner than you might think. If I had to do it all over again, I&#39;d make sure I had more help, more sleep and more breaks from the baby. We expect too much, from ourselves and from others, and believe me, the details do not really matter much in the long run. You will all be fine, just different. And wiser.</p>

      <p>And I&#39;m another mama who went through PPD after both my kids were born (35 and 32 years ago). If only they had had safe-for-breastfeeding meds then, like they do now, I would have taken them. It&#39;s definitely more than 1 in 10 women who suffer from this. It&#39;s under-reported because not everyone is AS BRAVE AS YOU, Molly. I promise, as everyone else has, that it will pass. Glad you have help, and I hope you are getting sleep, and sunshine.</p>

      <p>And I&#39;m another mama who went through PPD after both my kids were born (35 and 32 years ago). If only they had had safe-for-breastfeeding meds then, like they do now, I would have taken them. It&#39;s definitely more than 1 in 10 women who suffer from this. It&#39;s under-reported because not everyone is AS BRAVE AS YOU, Molly. I promise, as everyone else has, that it will pass. Glad you have help, and I hope you are getting sleep, and sunshine.</p>
<p>A big hug from NY! (Oh, and June? Edibly adorable!)</p>

      <p>You know, you are a brilliant and well rounded woman. I have watched your blog and book for quite awhile. I&#39;m sure your Dad is up there proud as he can be. Thank you for sharing.</p>
<p> The one thought I would like you and everyone to remember&#8230; hormones (all types) are some of the strongest and most mind altering substances in our bodies. If they can make us attempt to move a car off a person (cortisol), hide true amounts of bodily pain from our brains (oxytocin), and make men go into battle (testosterone), they can also cause mind altering amounts of painful feelings. Hence, it is perfectly understandable how they can disguise our true personalities while we are under their  spell.  We are immersed in hormone fog!!!<br />Just remember, the human spirit (brain off hormones) eventually comes out of any fog to a clearer day. :)) Big hug. </p>

      <p>Hello, Molly! I too just had a baby. She was born last February, and I had a mean case of postpartum (though I was mostly in denial). I threw a jug of cranberry juice at the wall, cried a bunch, and felt really overwhelmed. I can say that the last few months, I feel like the colors are slowly returning to all that is around me.

      <p>Just one more voice telling you that you absolutely will get through it.  Take all the help that is offered.  Trust your doctors/family/misc support systems to help you to the other side.  Post-partum depression is terrible, and I wish we both had been spared, but you will get out the other side and be yourself again.  Just take it a day/hour/moment at a time. It will get better little by little until one day you will realize it&#39;s gone.</p>

Post-partum depression is terrible, and I wish we both had been spared, but you will get out the other side and be yourself again.  Just take it a day/hour/moment at a time. It will get better little by little until one day you will realize it&#39;s gone.</p>

      <p>It&#39;s totally unfair, isn&#39;t it? ou go through so much, and you feel like you should be perfectly happy with your healthy baby&#8230; but you&#39;re not. I was too out of my mind and new at hormones to realize it as a teenager, but during my postpartum depression, I realized it. I think I always thought that we had these pure, immutable souls inside our bodies, but after my first baby, I knew that I was a big blob of chemicals and hormones. We are our bodies. Treat yourself very, very well, and let the people around you take care of you. You&#39;ll be okay. And after my second baby, I didn&#39;t really get the depression&#8211; so it&#39;s not a given that you&#39;ll feel this way next time, if there is a next time. (Don&#39;t think about that right now, though.)</p>

      <p>Molly,<br />I dotn know if you are still breastfeeding but PLEASE listen&#8230;I just wanted to give you a FYI about depression and weaning too.  When you are nursing, your body releases oxytocin in high amounts, so when you wean, your body and hormones go awire.  For about 6 weeks you feel restless, depressed, anxious and STRANGE&#8230;its happened to me and ALL of my friends.  However, its much, much easier if you know before hand and brace yourself.  It WILL pass though.  What a beautiful little girl you have.  Best wishes.<br />Esme</p>

      <p>I will add my voice to the masses in thanking you for sharing this post and your situation. Like many others who have posted here so far, I too suffered from PPD, and like you I never recognized it because it didn&#39;t feel like &#8220;depression&#8221;. I felt anxious, overwhelmed, manic, angry and desperate in varying amounts from day to day and moment to moment. I remember clearly wondering at one particularly dark moment if I could just get in my car and drive away from my beautiful but sleepless baby and inhumanly patient husband. Luckily I didn&#39;t and those feelings did eventually pass. Looking back I can now see that I was indeed suffering from both the massive personal upheaval that new motherhood brings and the hormonal onslaught of PPD. My son is now a healthy, happy and secure almost three year old, and aside from occasional moments of frustration with his (totally normal and thankfully rare) whining or tantrums, I feel completely in control of my emotions again. You too will get through this, as so many of us have. Because as all of the cliches rightly tell us, admitting you have a problem is the first step and reaching out is the second. I thank you for your bravery and candor, and hope that your story inspires more completely normal women and wonderful mothers (who also happen to have PPD) to do the same.</p>

      <p>June is gorgeous. You poor thing, you are not alone. I had PPD after both of my pregnancies. I like to call it &#8220;hormonal hijacking.&#8221;  It will get better, lots better. And, just in case you are contemplating having more kids some day (ha ha), it was easier the second time around because I knew what to expect. Hang in there! </p>

      <p>June is gorgeous. You poor thing, you are not alone. I had PPD after both of my pregnancies. I like to call it &#8220;hormonal hijacking.&#8221;  It will get better, lots better. And, just in case you are contemplating having more kids some day (ha ha), it was easier the second time around because I knew what to expect. Hang in there! </p>

      <p>Hi Molly, I found your site thru Sophie Dahl&#39;s list of favorite sites.  For the last two years between admiring your photographs and recipes, I have always found a sort of peaceful start to my morning.  Yours is one of a few that I check up on daily.  Reading your blog thru your pregnancy and now seeing June develop into such a beautiful child has been joyous.   This time will pass and you will get better.   You are so lucky to have been diagnosed and are getting the treatment.   I wasn&#39;t so lucky nineteen years ago so after all the news about postpartum depression I feel so happy you young mothers today are getting help.  Love to you and your beautiful family!  Michele</p>

      <p>Ah Molly.  Whilst my experience wasn&#39;t post-partum depression but depression after the death of my sister, I will never forget the feelings of being utterly and completely overwhelmed by the thought of even the simplest of tasks &#8211; like emptying the dishwasher &#8211; so I just laid on the couch instead. For almost a year. You are not alone in any of this &#8211; you have Brandon and your inner circle of soul-saving family and friends who can carry you for a while, you have June who has THAT face and THOSE eyes, you have &#8220;help&#8221; that is helping (better living through chemistry I always say) and you have thousands of us out here in interweb land singing your song and sending out encouragement in our own ways. Keep talking, tell your story. We&#39;re all here cheering for you. X</p>

      <p>I remember feeling more completely overwhelmed than I have ever felt in my life, and being surprised by how dark some of my thoughts were (especially when I contrasted it with how happy I was supposed to be at this beautiful little baby that I oh so wanted) and how isolated I felt.  I suspect I had some form of postpartum depression, but did not get it diagnosed.  Certainly it is a time of soul-searching, transition, strong hormones, no sleep, worry, being needed 24/7 and a few other things I am forgetting &#8211; probably a hard combination to work though.  My daughter is almost 5 &#8211; we are still figuring things out (as it should  be), but that dark fog has lifted.

      <p>I have thought long and hard about writing this comment; so many others have written everything I have wanted to say and more, and have said it far better.<br />I too have been a long (long, long) time reader but have never commented. This entry touched so many nerves and raw feelings that it is hard to pinpoint exactly what I want to say. PPD runs rampant in my family; my grandmother spent the first few years of my mother&#39;s life in a mental institution. My own mother, while never diagnosed to my knowledge, was non-maternal at best. I fear these things to the ends of the earth, and am terrified to one day have children and experience them myself. It is a fear that wells deep down that I am afraid to name or speak aloud until read this entry. Thank you for giving voice to so many women&#39;s deep dark secrets, and for being okay with not being okay at this moment in time. <br />A great writer once wrote, &#8220;there is life after survival,&#8221; and I am relieved to see you learning just that, for both of our sake.</p>
<p>Thank you, Molly.</p>

      <p>What a beautiful, beautiful baby!</p>
<p>I too went through this and can assure that it does indeed pass.  It fees big, it feels like there is nothing outside of it, and (to me, at least) it feels somewhat unnatural &#8230; I mean, here I was with this perfect beautiful baby, and I just wanted to cry all the time, but it does pass.  Believe it or not, you will look back even on the hard hard newborn days and remember all the little pieces of joy and discovery with love and happiness.</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve never commented before, but I love your writing. I too had PPD but mine went undiagnosed for a long time &#8211; like a year. I can barely think about that time without cringing. Though you are probably not thinking about this now, I didn&#39;t want to have another baby for 5 years after my first because of my PPD. After my second, I had what I can only describe as postpartum euphoria, must to my surprise and joy. Hang in there. It is a tough row to hoe, but you can come out the other end with great joy.</p>

      <p>I had crippling PPD after my first born. I didn&#39;t know what hit me. It was so awful. Mainly because I had no one to tell me that it would pass and I would be okay. I hate to think about how much I hurt during those dark days. I felt so ashamed. With some great therapy, an antidepressant and some serious sleeping pills (I had to stop breastfeeding), I was a new person again in no time (although it seemed like an eternity then!). I still feel so cheated that I didn&#39;t get to enjoy those first days with my oldest daughter, who is the light of my life. It took me almost five years to have another baby because I was so terrified to experience the PPD again. Of course, the second time was beautiful and happy. Which made me feel even more cheated during that first go.  Anyway, I tell everyone who will listen (when it&#39;s appropriate) about my PPD and I am not ashamed now. Other women have &#8220;secretly&#8221; come to talk to me when they were struggling after childbirth. But they are not so vocal&#8230;and that makes me sad. I was able to help them but they never would&#39;ve known if I hadn&#39;t advertised my own struggle. We need not be ashamed ~ it&#39;s something so out of our control ~ and that&#39;s why I admire this post and your transparency. I hope you are feeling better very soon&#8230;.I assure you there&#39;s another side and it&#39;s glorious!  XOXO</p>

      <p>I know you&#39;ve already read it a gazillion times now, but I had the exact same experience.  I can almost laugh now, remembering holding a crying baby at whatever god-awful hour it was, and crying myself, saying &#8220;What is it??? What do you need?&#8221;  There were other less memorable but still overwhelming and almost unbearable moments.  However, I thank God for my daughter.  I continue to love her so much that I can&#39;t breathe sometimes.  Even if she is 13 year old hormonal crazy sometimes.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly.<br />I&#39;ve followed you here for quite a while, and was so thrilled for your sweet little June to arrive. My third born joined us on August 21st, and wow, I&#39;d forgotten just how real and intense those hormones can be &#8211; yowza! I guess my experiences have fallen in the &#8220;normal&#8221; realm. But there&#39;s nothing normal feeling about it, for sure. I am SO glad you have gotten some help, and are taking care of yourself. You&#39;re an amazing MAMA for doing that for you both. Thanks for sharing Hugs and and prayers. <br />Stacy</p>

      <p>Molly,<br />i dont really know what to say after 312 comments but I will try my best. First off I am so sorry you have to go through this. I know how much it sucks and it hurts every cell of your body. I wanted to curl up into a ball and die the first 4 months of my sons life (and he is only five months now). And recently I have been going through this feeling like I am about to faint and I have almost blacked out twice for no reason really. Ugh. It is horrible. The newborn stage is horrible. It pushes you in ways you never thought was possible, mentally and physically. I still feel like everything is too much at times, like how am I suppose to make myself lunch let alone try to bake a batch of cookies (which is my all time favorite thing to do). It kind of like trying to learn how to live all over again and in a new way. It is just different now&#8230; we get so use to things being how they were of being able to take naps and cook whatever and whenever we want. But you just have to take it one hour at a time and set little goals for yourself like make dinner on tuesday night or make sure to eat breakfast or go for a walk around the block and then do two blocks&#8230; then three. You have to take baby steps with your baby. It&#39;s hard. I don&#39;t know a single person who has said it is easy&#8230; they just skip the hard part to try to talk about how wonderful the new life is. And it is wonderful and crazy and beautiful&#8230; but it is also so hard on our bodies. Just make sure you are taking care of yourself too, eating right and taking vitamin (vitamin b and d has really helped me), and email me if you need to vent about how hard things are or just to talk about the different things our bodies are going through. <a href="mailto:ngprince@gmail.com">ngprince@gmail.com</a>   </p>

      <p>Just have to add to the roar: I was there too!  I didn&#39;t sleep for a week straight to the point where I was terrified to drive because I thought I would crash either from slowed reaction time or to make that crazy siren in my head keep from going off.  I&#39;d never had depression before and the whole thing really took me by surprise.  I was blissful being pregnant and so happy with my easy smiley wonderful little son.  But it hit me like a mac truck.  I went to a great psychiatrist after my sleepless week.  I took a very low dose of some drug that I forget the name of, and from that point on it all got steadily better.  You lose perspective completely in those first weeks and months, which you can know and do nothing about.  It&#39;s so frustrating.  You are brave to admit what you have been going through and I know it will be helpful to others.  I guess I was lead to believe it would all be some kind of blissful honeymoon full of adorable accessories and good smells.  NO no no no no. But it is real and beautiful in a fierce dark deep transformative way that I wouldn&#39;t trade.  My son&#39;s three now.  He&#39;s only gotten more smiley and phenomenal.  I wish you guys all the best.  Your daughter is absolutely gorgeous! </p>

      <p>My memories of pregnancy, childbirth, etc, are of suddenly not being myself. I don&#39;t think I was depressed&#8211;way too busy for any self examination, but it was a period of being overwhelmed by circumstances outside of my control. Allow yourself to be unhappy and out of control&#8211;you can come through it. Your life will not be perfect (I doubt it was before), but can be satisfying and fun again. Your beautiful baby will be his own person, so try very hard to sit back and watch him become what he wants to be. Your life&#39;s journey will be richer for him.</p>

      <p>Thank you, for your bravery. I went through this 18 months ago, with the birth of my daughter. I am so glad you are getting help. You can do this! On the other side is fun toddlerhood with your daughter, and a healthy you. I am sending you all the energy in the universe, and this advice: when people offer to help, just say YES.</p>

      <p>I know you&#39;re getting the affirmation and support you need from all these comments (and all that love!), but I wanted to add my belated voice, too. I had a mild case of ppd with my first (wonderful, easy) and then a stronger case with my second (also wonderful, easy) son: and the voice in my head kept slapping me around for being *such a wimp!* and *such a bad mom!* for feeling so wiped out and crying so easily and feeling like I&#39;d never, ever, ever get my/a &#8220;real life&#8221; back. . .  Luckily it just passed in about a month, but that experience helped me recognize a later bout of just plain regular depression. . .  and taught me that wow. It&#39;s tough to shake and truly weird and debilitating. Hope you are loving yourself and continuing to reach out and take. care! I love reading Anne Lamott&#39;s Traveling Mercies when I&#39;m struggling, and her idea of small steps through the dark has been very helpful to me. Warm thoughts and best wishes. </p>

      <p>Thank you for posting about this, I&#39;m about to have my second baby and am a little worried about how we&#39;ll (I&#39;ll!) cope. Our first had a long stay in hopsital and was quite stressful, so we&#39;re not sure what the whole baby/newborn thing entails. Can&#39;t wait to hold a little person in my arms though, and to take him home will be a dream come true. <br />Best of luck, June&#39;s a very lucky girl, you did the best thing by getting help, I hope I&#39;m as brave.</p>

      <p>Dear Molly,<br />Any form of depression is scary. I&#39;ve battled with depression and have two friends who have and have had ppd.

      <p>I was touched by reading this; you have a talent for writing and storytelling even when expressing experiences that are difficult.  We know that it takes a lot from a women&#39;s body to conceive and make a baby, to form all of those cells.  As well as changes in hormones, often women become vitamin and mineral deficient during the process.  After birth, breastfeeding, is suppose to help balance this out, but sometimes the deficiencies are great.  Women tend to be magnesium and B12 deficient, these coexist and interact with hormones to regulate brain function and emotions.  You could have a blood test for these, especially magnesium, which is not often tested for in regular blood tests.  You wrote once that you were anemic during pregnancy so this triggered this line of thought for me.  You could ask your Dr. or midwife about this to complement your other therapies. Take care!  Being a new mom is one of life&#39;s greatest challenges and greatest pleasures. Thanks for writing this.</p>

      <p>dear Molly, I had postpartum depression after both my babies and both times it started as insomnia and progressed into severe anxiety which I did not understand was depression. The first time I thought my life was over, that I was going to be on drugs the rest of my life and unable to cope.  But both times, I was able to be on antidepressants for just 6 months, with self-care and talking to my family and best friend (never did find a therapist who was better than them!).</p>
<p>I vowed to tell my story to anybody who expressed the slightest interest OR slightest disparagement of mental illness.  I have done that.  Sometimes I even mention something when a pregnant friend wonders what being a new mom will be like &#8211; no one mentioned it to ME.  Naming things and being honest sets you free!</p>
<p>Thank you for telling your story.  I hope you come out of the fog soon and resume thinking there is hope and beauty in life.  Your little girl is so sweet.</p>

      <p>As you can see &#8211; so many suffer or suffered from it. I did also. And loving support is more important than ever.

      <p>Good for you for writing about this, life, including motherhood, isn&#39;t always what we think it will be.  Pregnant women are warned about lack of sleep and all that but no one warns you how completely overwhelming it all is, and how you might feel totally inadequate.  I can relate.  I wasn&#39;t diagnosed or anything, I may not have technically had PPD, but I DID feel totally overwhelmed, inadequate, and very tearful.  But it got better! Hang in there!</p>

      <p>I had it and it was awful &#8211; much more so the first time. There is this extraordinary tension between the now and not yet all mixed in with the really unbelievable fact that a hospital just let you walk out of the building with a human being &#8211; no test, no tools, no questions asked. I remember having the completely real but illogical idea that I was going to go to sleep with a 6 week old baby and wake up to her being in college and I somehow missed every single moment in between. I also felt like I had one of those fat broccoli rubber bands around my lungs. It goes away, thank goodness and then you can actually start ENJOYING that pretty little sweet bear angel butt.

      <p>Molly,<br />I am so sorry you have had to deal with this, but I am convinced that most new mothers have some degree of PPD.  Mine was more anxiety than depression and I kept thinking I should just get a grip.  I didn&#39;t know how bad it had become until I stopped eating.  For someone who loves food, and who often sought it out for comfort, that was a Big Deal. I went to counciling and things got better.<br />What I wish someone would have told me before S was born is that for the first three or so months you are basically doing maintenance. Your baby is just taking things in and not giving anything back.  Which wasn&#39;t so bad when they are still in the womb, because you could take care of yourself and you were taking care of them. But once they are born it is very hard to take care of both you and your baby to the extent needed to keep you both healthy and happy.<br />S is now nine months old and she gives as much as she takes.  It gets fun. And different, not necessarily easier, but much, much better.<br />Sorry if this is disjointed, I can hear her waking up in the other room and must dash&#8230;</p>

      <p>Molly, I don&#39;t have children, and I realize there are a zillion women out there with personal, heartfelt stories. All I can offer is that I&#39;m proud of you for sharing, and I hope you get to feeling better very soon. Our gloomy weather doesn&#39;t help much, but maybe this batch of partly-sunny afternoons will make a difference. Good thoughts are being sent your way from West Ballard!

      <p>Post partum depression is more common than anyone would think.  So glad you got the diagnosis and help you need and deserve.  It&#39;s been mentioned before, but Postpartum Progress is an invaluable tool &#8211; even after you get through the thick of it.  It does get better, it will get better and you deserve to be happy.

      <p>I just found your lovely blog because I regularly check Postpartum Progress, which linked to you.  I work with women suffering (from what we like to gently, respectfully call) perinatal mood concerns.  I am a social worker.  And a mom.  And yes, more than anything, women who are *in it* just want to hear from other women who somehow made it through.  I&#39;m glad you were able to get help.  and congrats on a gorgeous baby!!  </p>
<p>It sounds like you have good support&#8211;I have a lot of books/online resources if you need more and I&#39;m happy to help.</p>
<p>Ps. we have dear friends on Bainbridge Island and the next time we visit I am putting your restaurant on the list!</p>

      <p>I worried about the same thing when I was diagnosed with PPD after the birth of my middle child. I didn&#39;t want to be on antidepressants forever. I was on them for six months, then I gradually tapered off and didn&#39;t relapse. I will say that, for me, it always took about 1.5-2 years to feel totally myself after birth. This is mainly because I am an introverted creative person, and the littles don&#39;t allow much time for solitary creativity. It gets easier though. I&#39;m glad you recognized it and helped yourself!</p>

      <p>Thank you for writing this. My baby was born 6 months ago and at first, despite him being in intensive care, I felt fine. But slowly this feeling of wrongness just kept building and worsening. I didn&#39;t think it was PPD because I didn&#39;t feel sad exactly, just wrong, not me, sort of isolated. It was like I was insulated from the world and angry at the same time if that makes any sense. Angry with the world, my partner, everyone except the baby (thank God). I&#39;d look at his perfect little face and think why am I not happier? I never told anyone because I was terrified they would find out what an awful mother I clearly was and I somehow managed to fake it through meeting friends etc. Reading this and the comments made me think for the first time that maybe this was hormonal not just me being an unfit mother. It gave me the confidence to speak to my doctor about getting help but (and this is why I am writing this) then 2 days ago my period suddenly started even though I&#39;m still breastfeeding and honestly, it is like a cloud has lifted. So thank you for having the courage to write this, I hope other women who are where I was 3 months ago see your post and don&#39;t have to go through all this agony. And also thanks to the kind person who mentioned the Cup of Jo article that made my sudden lift make sense. I hope your reprieve is in sight too, you are in my thoughts. </p>

      <p>Molly &#8211; first, June is absolutely precious&#8230;.  This is such a hard topic, so personal but so pervasive for Mommy&#39;s.  And I agree, it isn&#39;t much spoken about, so your candid, heart-felt words are all the more poignant.  I had my first baby six months ago and I plunged into some pretty dark weeks, though in hindsight, I didn&#39;t talk much about it or seek help&#8230;because I was afraid that I may have to admit that I have something slightly more real and weighty than &#39;mommy blues.&#39;  I wanted to be &#39;normal&#39; and a good mom.  Not the Mom with &#39;problems.&#39;  I found my way through the hard weeks through lots of prayer, my husband of course, and allowing the love to heal the pain and turmoil.  And yes, eventually the hormones subside and sweet normalcy seeps back into life.  And what you are left with is another stitch in the eternal quilt of motherhood, worked on by many a brilliant and knowing mother since time immemorial.  I wish you strength and grace!  You will get through this.</p>

      <p>Molly &#8211; first, June is absolutely precious&#8230;.  This is such a hard topic, so personal but so pervasive for Mommy&#39;s.  And I agree, it isn&#39;t much spoken about, so your candid, heart-felt words are all the more poignant.  I had my first baby six months ago and I plunged into some pretty dark weeks, though in hindsight, I didn&#39;t talk much about it or seek help&#8230;because I was afraid that I may have to admit that I have something slightly more real and weighty than &#39;mommy blues.&#39;  I wanted to be &#39;normal&#39; and a good mom.  Not the Mom with &#39;problems.&#39;  I found my way through the hard weeks through lots of prayer, my husband of course, and allowing the love to heal the pain and turmoil.  And yes, eventually the hormones subside and sweet normalcy seeps back into life.  And what you are left with is another stitch in the eternal quilt of motherhood, worked on by many a brilliant and knowing mother since time immemorial.  I wish you strength and grace!  You will get through this.</p>

      <p>Ditto on a lot of that. I was overwhelmed, not sad, and I, too, write better when I&#39;m unhappy. So I wrote, a lot, and eventually wrote myself out of it. (Well, that and therapy and medication, but honestly writing helped a lot.) </p>

      <p>I, too, suffered from postpartum depression after my first child. Unlike you, I didn&#39;t seek professional help and boy-oh-boy was that a mistake. My friend, you&#39;re going to be ok.

      <p>Molly, had my first baby a few months before your little one was born and I struggled with postpartum depression too. I had anticipated it, as I&#39;ve struggled with depression some before, and figured it probably would rear it&#39;s head again with all of the hormones. <br />It&#39;s a beast. It makes us feel like beasts. The thoughts we have aren&#39;t our own. Thankfully, it will pass, and with the help of our loved ones, we can grope through the fog. <br />Good, quality sleep, and time, those were the things that helped me the most. I never ended up going on medication for this bout, though if I had, it might have ended sooner. <br />But fear not, there is light on the other side. 🙂 I finally enjoy being a mom (of an 8 month old!), something I worried I would never do. Sending prayers and love your way. -Lauren</p>

      <p>I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re going through it, but I&#39;m glad you found a way to post about your postpartum depression.  Dealing with it is the best way to get rid of it, and other parents will benefit from your experiences.</p>
<p>My first baby is almost 21 (!), and I now realize that I had post-partum depression after she was born.  I distinctly remember that feeling of being overwhelmed and became incapacitated by the baby&#39;s needs, my emotions, my fears&#8230;  I didn&#39;t recognize what it was at the time, but maybe should have suspected since my mother went through it with my sister.  I thought it was just a reaction to my inexperience.</p>
<p>I felt so distant from, and jealous of, the other new mothers I knew who were coping just fine.  They took things in stride, where I worried over every detail.  I imagine these differences made me less inclined to reach out. </p>
<p>My husband and family were, and are, very supportive, and the depression eventually passed as my hormones settled down and I became more confident in caring for the new baby.  It also did not return when I had my second daughter 3 years later.</p>
<p>I&#39;m here to say you will get through this, and be able to enjoy your baby, husband, and life again.  Best of luck to you!</p>

      <p>I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re going through it, but I&#39;m glad you found a way to post about your postpartum depression.  Dealing with it is the best way to get rid of it, and other parents will benefit from your experiences.</p>
<p>My first baby is almost 21 (!), and I now realize that I had post-partum depression after she was born.  I distinctly remember that feeling of being overwhelmed and became incapacitated by the baby&#39;s needs, my emotions, my fears&#8230;  I didn&#39;t recognize what it was at the time, but maybe should have suspected since my mother went through it with my sister.  I thought it was just a reaction to my inexperience.</p>
<p>I felt so distant from, and jealous of, the other new mothers I knew who were coping just fine.  They took things in stride, where I worried over every detail.  I imagine these differences made me less inclined to reach out. </p>
<p>My husband and family were, and are, very supportive, and the depression eventually passed as my hormones settled down and I became more confident in caring for the new baby.  It also did not return when I had my second daughter 3 years later.</p>
<p>I&#39;m here to say you will get through this, and be able to enjoy your baby, husband, and life again.  Best of luck to you!</p>

      <p>When my midwife suspected that I was going down that road, she recommended a book called Laughter and Tears.  It was helpful to see what I was feeling in black and white on a page.  Be reassured that it is overwhelming for most.  <br />Love the clear blue eyes!</p>

      <p>Kia kaha, Molly! That loosely translates to stay strong, and I know from this blog and your book (of which I just bought three copies; one for me and two as gifts) that you are so strong, even if you don&#39;t feel that way right now.</p>
<p>And what a lovely, lovely baby you have! I have only seen the photo on the back cover of the book, but she looks like you!</p>

      <p>So glad you are getting the help you need! This is very common&#8230;you need to OWN that. There are plenty out there having these experiences and you are so lucky&#8230;you have a network of support and a beautiful baby and you are going to be just fine!<br />Of note, I&#39;ve heard that some women experience this with one baby but not ALL pregnancies so&#8230;don&#39;t let this scare you off of another, if you want one, and know that there is nothing to be ashamed of&#8230;heck, I&#39;m so glad there are people like yourself TALKING about this to give women courage to seek help and treatment!</p>

      <p>Thanks for sharing. I had (undiagnosed) PPD with my first child, and it was awful&#8230; especially thinking it was so stigmatized I couldn&#39;t talk about it. Now that I&#39;m through it, I tell everyone I know &#8212; this happened to me, it could happen to you, it&#39;s not a shameful thing, you can get help, it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re a bad mom, or don&#39;t love your beautiful baby enough &#8212; all things I thought! Anyway, the light will shine again, you&#39;ll get more sleep soon, and you will be the person your friends can talk to when this happens to them. Thanks again for posting this.</p>

      <p>Dear Molly &#8211;<br />thank you for writing about this and sharing in the fabulous way that you always do.  I love your writing and have followed your blog ever since reading your book a couple of years ago. <br />As sorry as I am to hear that you have been suffering from PPD, I am relieved to know that&#39;s why you haven&#39;t been in this space. I&#39;ll admit I was very worried when you weren&#39;t posting that something was wrong with the baby, but clearly- she is the most beautiful girl ever!  and appears to be hale and hardy and I am so glad to know that.  I kept telling myself you were just dealing with being a new mom, no sleep etc, so sorry that wasn&#39;t exactly the case but I know that you will get through this time as women with PPD do and I&#39;m very glad you sought help and are getting it.  hang in there and when all else fails, gaze on that lovely child.</p>

      <p>One in ten hey? I&#39;m surprised it isn&#39;t more. Good on ya for getting help and also writing about it. Just remember, in the moments when you may be feeling judged or fear that you may be judged that you are out there doing your best, that you are the &#8220;man in the arena&#8221;. If you haven&#39;t read it yet, I send you a little something from Teddy Roosevelt that I hope will give you courage and hope in moments you may need it:</p>
<p>THE MAN IN THE ARENA<br />                                          Excerpt from the speech &#8220;Citizenship In A Republic&#8221;<br />                                          delivered at the Sorbonne, in Paris, France on 23 April, 1910</p>
<p>    It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. </p>

      <p>Hi Molly. I hope you&#39;re holding up ok. I love reading whatever you write (and cute baby pictures are a bonus these days). Also I just wanted to say: Banana Cereal Muffins. Life Changing. </p>

      <p>Wow at 301 comments I&#39;m no sure if you&#39;ll read this. It doesn&#39;t matter, I just feel compelled to respond to something so close to home. I went through it too. A good month after the birth of my 3rd daughter. It was hard. It took me a year to crawl out of it. It was even harder to be honest about it but thank god, it didn&#39;t stay that way and I had a loving, helping, patient husband that helped tremendously. I love to read your blog and enjoyed your book so much. This kind of honesty is just adding to the reasons why I come back for more. Also that baby is gorgeous! 🙂 Don&#39;t beat yourself over it, enjoy the little happy moments even if they feel lost in the big grey ones. It&#39;s great that you asked for help, so few of us do. You&#39;ll pull through! Hang in there Mama! xoxo</p>

      <p>Thank you for this.  My son is five months, and since his birth I have felt so overwhelmed but come up with reasons why that was the case.  I keep telling myself to just deal with it.  I think this is the push I needed to talk to the social worker my son&#39;s pediatrician recommended when I did the &#8220;my friend has this problem&#8221; kind of thing.</p>

      <p>I think it&#39;s great that you speak up. As a mother of a toddler and a three month old I know what it means to become a mother. Ok, it&#39;s not always so much fun to be pregnant, and yes, it hurts to deliver the baby but the emotional (and hormonal!) side of it &#8211; that&#39;s the REALLY tough part. To care for this tiny human being so totally dependent on me, I felt was the one task in my life that I had to get done well. It&#39;s just huge and yes, overwhelming. I&#39;m sending you a virtual hug and hope that you&#39;re feeling better already!!</p>

      <p>I think you hit a nerve here. I also had postpartum depression &#8211; undiagnosed except by me. At the time, I just kept going and I smiled at the right times. But every evening I cried &#8211; it was the loneliest time when I was most desperate. Every day for weeks I wondered whether I would ever have fun and feel happy again. I wondered how anyone could possibly have two kids. It was dark and dreary in my head. </p>
<p>I recovered, but I wish I&#39;d be aware enough to get help. It wasn&#39;t nearly so bad with my second baby.</p>

      <p>Thanks for writing this. </p>
<p>My daughter is three-and-a-half now and I was one of those who had postpartum depression and got help after suffering for too long. I will say this about having a kid: It can destroy you. But if you give it time and love yourself and your family through it, the experience builds you up into a stronger person capable of loving not just your child but the whole world in a way that might astonish you. </p>

      <p>Greetings from Olympia! This was me with our first daughter. I knew something wasn&#39;t right when I found myself just wanting to give her to someone else to raise and go back to my &#8220;normal life.&#8221; I was so overwhelmed and nursing was hard and, you said it, I was full of crazy hormones. I was nervous it would happen again with our second daughter, but it didn&#39;t. I saw my daughter for a long time through the eyes of someone who connected her to that hard time, but now I see we &#8211; she &#8211; thrived in spite of the hardship. I feel like we triumphed in the face of a great storm together. We&#39;ve got your back, girl. And June is a stunner! Sending good thoughts northward to you. </p>

      <p>Another gal mentioned Seattle-area PEPS, and I want to double-nominate it!  Being in the presence of other moms going through the same thing at the same time (including PPD!) is a HUGE support system that you never knew you needed.  We run a similar non-profit organization in Southern California and seeing moms support each other through this very crazy period of newborns is nothing short of incredible.  When people say &#8220;reach out for help!&#8221;, that doesn&#39;t always mean babysitting, housework, and diaper changing&#8230;emotional help is just as crucial.  </p>
<p>PPD is short, intense, and it SUCKS.  It is very, very real.  I hope you find a great support system through other moms with newborns the same age.  Thank you for sharing your story &#8211; and may tomorrow be less foggy than yesterday!</p>

      <p>Hi Molly &#8211;<br />I&#39;ve been reading your blog for a while and I love your writing.  You are an inspiration.  I had perfect baby boy 8 months ago and I felt <i>awful</i>.  There are so many &#8220;should&#8221; statements around childbirth and new motherhood, and for the first 4 months my experience was the opposite.  It&#39;s easy to tell ourselves that it&#39;s the hormones (and thank goodness that mecidine has come far enough that we know that!), but in the moment that&#39;s hardly a consolation.</p>
<p>Please know that you are SO strong to confront this and deal with it.  And that this shall pass and normalcy will return to your life.  Well&#8230;  At least a new kind of normalcy 🙂  But you <b>will</b> feel like <i>you</i> again.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly&#8230;&#8230; I am so glad you are feeling better. Depression of any sort is totally not understandable until you experience it yourself. I know that you will remember how you felt and bring this experience to others you may meet or know throughout your life.It is important for all of us to take care of others. Sometimes a little sharing can make such a difference in another person&#39;s life. Being kind is something so simple&#8230;. so basic&#8230;. but the one thing we always forget to do.I continue to enjoy your writing and think of you three often. Hugs to you across the miles between Idaho and Washington. Since I am about your mom&#39;s age and from the mid- West originally ( Kansas)I am especially proud that you are such a creative talented young woman. You and Brandon will continue to be wonderful parents to June. Also remember to BE KIND to yourself!!!<br /> janie Walker</p>

      <p>Pacific Northwest winters and a new babe&#8230;uugh, it almost seems unfair.  There should be bright pink flowers on all the trees and Disney bluebirds fluttering about. But no, just rain and darkness.  I went through the same thing with my second daughter and although I didn&#39;t read all 397 comments to make sure this advice hasn&#39;t already been given, I&#39;m going to run the risk of redundancy because it&#39;s so important:  DO NOT LISTEN TO COUNTRY MUSIC!  I&#39;m not even kidding.  In fact, I had to listen to only reggae for six months.  Seriously.<br />Also, juicing and listening to metaphysical podcasts.<br />It was ridiculous but also kind of sweet and gave me a little bit of mood busting light from within.<br />Thanks for being so honest.</p>

      <p>Well, this is comment 401 because I just checked back in with your blog and read this. I want to say two things:<br />1. June is freakin&#39; adorable!<br />2. I am proud of you (that sounds really old and motherly but I mean it from a different place) for writing about something like this, a harder more unpleasant part of motherhood. I have a blog and also, don&#39;t like writing when I&#39;m not in a good space. And yet, I&#39;ve been dealing with infertility. Again, not something fun to dwell on but something very real going on in my life. And also, something that many women go through. So, if I can reach any other person dealing with that, I also will feel better for putting it out there. Good for you.</p>

      <p>I had it too. My son is 4 now. I worried so much that my PPD would somehow rub off on him, that I&#39;d somehow NEVER be able to be the kind of mom I&#39;d hoped I could be. And it is so alienating, and the insomnia is so awful, especially when people are constantly saying, &#8220;You&#39;ll never sleep again! Just wait until they&#39;re teenagers!&#8221; And they JUST DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND that the insomnia that can accompany PPD makes the sleeplessness of new parenthood so, so, so, SO much more intense. And there&#39;s not a ton written out there about it. But I&#39;m a survivor, and I&#39;m happy, and my four year old is wonderful, smart, and healthy, and I love him and I love being a mom now. And I didn&#39;t for a while, even though I tried so hard to love it. This is a bit rambling, but: I&#39;ve been there. I get it. Huge, huge virtual hugs from me, a stranger who really isn&#39;t such a stranger after all, but rather a comrade-in-arms. </p>

      <p>Oh Molly. The place you are in resonates. I had ppd after my second daughter was born, 18 months after her sister. My husband worked two jobs &#038; classes. I was 22, hours from family and felt completely overwhelmed and even worse- hopeless. My sisters had never felt that way and tried to tell me I was fine which just made me feel crazy. I remember reading somewhere &#8220;how do you eat a whale?&#8221; and thinking &#39;you can&#39;t, that&#39;s ridiculous&#39; and seeing the answer &#8220;one bite at a time&#8221;. I suddenly realized that it was the big picture (the whale) that was freaking me out. I stopped worrying about the whale, and just worried about the bite in front of me. I also learned about what I call &#8220;survival mode&#8221;. This week I used survival mode while I was sick &#038; hubby was on duty (we have 4 kids now!). Survival mode is this. I must breathe, I must make sure kids eat. The rest is gravy. Maybe they don&#39;t get veg that day, maybe they wear dirty socks tomorrow. WE WILL SURVIVE! And mankind has &#038; does survive much worse. Read Little House books to little June someday. Thinking of those pioneer moms dealing with blizzards and no running water helped me put &#8220;survival mode&#8221; into historical perspective. </p>

      <p>This mom brain! I swear! The thing I intended to say before I got into that long memory, was this: FlyLady.net. I heard about her on a mom website and she saved my life. She is all about baby steps, and how to keep up when your aren&#39;t a born organized type of gal. She does what she does for free and thousands of moms have been able to get their heads above water thanks to her. Just ask around!</p>

      <p>I stumbled onto your blog for the first time yesterday while searching for a recipe for sweet potato fries. </p>
<p>Instead, I found your entry which made me feel better about the human race. I&#39;m saddened to learn that you&#39;ve been dealing with PPD; I hope it is rapidly fading to a blurry memory. However, your writing about it clearly has -and will- help others. Furthermore, the outpouring of compassionate, supportive, affectionate responses reminds me that we humans are fundamentally a good and decent lot. Sometimes we forget that. Thank you, all, for the lift.</p>
<p>PS. Molly, I showed the photo of your small enchantress to my husband of 52 years, remarking that I was sorry we didn&#39;t have a young one in our family currently. He replied, &#8220;She&#39;s gorgeous, -but you DO remember that&#39;s not the dangerous end, don&#39;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>-Spoken by a man who changed many diapers. He still makes me laugh.</p>

      <p>Just read this and was completely caught off guard because I am the happiest I have ever been in my life and had somehow forgotten that a year and a half ago my postpartum depression was so bad I wanted to die. It gets better, then better and so much better. I don&#39;t even know how the fog lifted, but I imagine it was some time around the time I got to sleep again. Only then was coping possible. Nothing can prepare you for the utter exhaustion that comes with a new baby and feelings of loss of self. Much love from Vancouver. </p>

Nothing can prepare you for the utter exhaustion that comes with a new baby and feelings of loss of self. Much love from Vancouver. </p>

      <p>My God, what a beautiful baby.  Thank you for having the courage to share your story.  Sharing our stories brings us women together and reminds us that we are not alone in our journeys, which are wonderful and messy and sometimes difficult.  Best wishes to you, and I promise, you will return to your normal self again. 🙂</p>

      <p>I see that you have already had such wonderful response, but i would like to share my experience as well.  I had (undiagnosed) post-partum with my first child, and I remember feeling so alone.  I don&#39;t need to explain the feeling to you, I know, but I do now share my experience with any expectant mother who I am close enough to share it with &#8211; not to scare them off, but to let them know that they are not alone, no matter how it may feel.<br />talking about it always helps.  I was so afraid of having postpartum the second time around that I nearly had anxiety attacks right after my son was born, until I realized that I had the tools to confront and handle it if it did happen&#8230;and then it dissipated.<br />thank you for your honest words, and your little June is so very dear!!</p>

      <p>I had not checked in on you for a while.  So, reading this morning I was sad to read what you are experiencing/or experienced by this point.  When I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, one of the other surgeries I needed was to have my ovaries removed.  After this surgery, I experienced something very similar.  Again, the abrupt disruption of hormones contributed to the development of depression.  I too, had the same experience of having something that I did not immediately see as depression.  I was overwhelmed.  Fortunately, I had experience with depression and a great cancer team who helped me toward medication and better days.  Your post pulled at my heart strings and I wanted your to know that I wish you well as you recover and with your treasured little one!</p>

      <p>I just want you to know that I read this, originally back when you posted it, and my heart went out to you.  </p>
<p>And then I had my second son, and what do you know: I lived it, too. And when I was going through it, this post of yours kept popping up from my memory banks, and it really did bring me comfort.  No one talks about it, you&#39;re right.  We should. </p>
<p>So anyway, I was Pinning your creamy beans recipe, and made a point today to go back and seek out this post so that I can say: Thank you, so much. Not only for sharing great recipes and your lovely stories, but for this post in particular.  It made me feel not quite so awful and horrid because of the horrible feelings I had post-partum.</p>

      <p>Thank you for your sharing this generously Molly. not many would face it and talk about it here. I was reading ‘a homemade life’ two days ago while commute home from work. so here I am today reading this post of yours.</p>
<p>I could relate a lot, I met my husband via email, we have a 8mo now. I suffered PPD the first three months due to a colicky baby and dealing with the toughest task of running and manning a ‘milk factory’ right after birth. I must admit the milk pumping at wee hours makes things tougher, dusky and lonely. I am thankful now &#8211; people and the proverb are right ‘after the storm comes the sunshine’. I am glad I found this post of yours and Well Done Molly!</p>
