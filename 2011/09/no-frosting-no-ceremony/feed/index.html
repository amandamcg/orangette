					<description><![CDATA[I love this cake and have made it a couple of times since you posted the recipe. I had some late season peaches that I needed to use up and substituted 3 peaches (cut into 8ths) for the plums, I also substituted 1/2 cup of barley flour for some of the regular flour. The results were excellent. Can&#039;t wait to make it again with plums now that they&#039;re all over the markets.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, this gem has sat in the back of my mind for a full year, and finally, today, while four plums grew mushy on the counter, I cam back to this. Can&#039;t believe I remembered it rattling around up there for so long! In my frenzy, I subbed buttermilk for milk and agave for golden syrup and oh, MY!! I&#039;m going to have to leave the house to ensure the 8 piece yield! Thanks for this gem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve now made this twice with plums and twice with pears. We usually eat it with salted caramel ice cream from Strauss family creamery, which is divine. Today&#039;s version was my favorite: I only had Asian pears, so I poached them first in Marsala and sugar to make them a little richer. We boiled down the Marsala, and used it as a sauce for the cake. Delicious.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this today with Italian plums.  Had to hunt all over for the golden syrup--found it at Whole Foods in Portland.  &lt;br /&gt;Just ate the first piece.  Wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for converting to metric weights--makes accuracy so easy.&lt;br /&gt;Still, I used a lot of pans and bowls to make this.  Definitely worth it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just popped the cake in the oven.  My golden syrup expired back in &#039;08 and so used some local, organic honey instead.  Unfortunately, my plums looked pretty sad.  I&#039;m hoping the oven heat will fix that and intensify their sugars, otherwise, I&#039;ll be giving this cake another try over the weekend!  The batter is delish.]]></description>
