					<description><![CDATA[I recently had a houseguest who left behind a huge bag of fresh corn. After making corn and black bean tacos, corn fritters with sweet chili dipping sauce, and so forth, I turned to this recipe to use up the rest. It could have been a little spicier (or maybe I had a wimpy jalapeno) but boy was it good! I used diced red onion instead of the scallions but otherwise did not deviate from the recipe. I ate the entire thing for dinner along with some toast (I&#039;m a little horrified at having consumed 3 tablespoons of butter in one sitting but it was worth it).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made a double recipe of this for a impromptu dinner party and had it as a side for a giant bowl of mussels. I have no leftovers and half the people didn&#039;t come! Talk about a raving endorsement. Thank you for sharing :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Jalapeno peppers need to come with posted reminders though: Don&#039;t touch anything after you chop them until you&#039;ve washed your hands with soap three times. It never fails, I always get some in my eyes or somewhere on my face and then walk around like a dork.]]></description>
