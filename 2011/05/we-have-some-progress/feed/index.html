					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s finally warming up here in Utah, too. And I love that video of the Boss! My favorite song of his is Hungry Heart. Did you know he actually wrote it for the Ramones after Joey requested that he write them a song? But then he liked the song so much he decided he had to record it for himself... Anyways... great video. Great song. Thanks for the link!]]></description>
