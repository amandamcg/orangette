					<description><![CDATA[I stumbled upon this recipe the other day and made it last night for my family with local (for us) Vermont kimchi.  Since my family includes a devastatingly picky 14 year old daughter who is &quot;allergic&quot; to the slightest hint of spice, and a perpetually hungry 17 year old son who really just wants to eat spaghetti with red sauce every night, I opted NOT to answer the &quot;what&#039;s for dinner?&quot; question with &quot;Kimchi Fried Rice.&quot;  Instead, I called it &quot;Bacon Fried Rice with Fried Eggs,&quot; and wouldn&#039;t you know that they responded with moderately guarded enthusiasm, as opposed to the eye-rolling outrage I get with some of my less &quot;normal&quot; answers?  And they both ATE IT UP, literally.  Note to parents: marketing matters, and if you can incorporate the words &quot;bacon,&quot; &quot;fried&quot; and even &quot;rice&quot; into what&#039;s for dinner, your teenagers will probably accept it.  So I call that a success.  I LOVED it, by the way, and will definitely be making it again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t even tasted it yet, but I made this tonight. About to eat it now. Used my new cast iron pan (actually an old one my mom got from a garage sale) from christmas for the first time! &lt;br /&gt;Also, first time commenting but I love Love LOVE your blog, and your book!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boyfriend, who normally waits for me to eat (as hospitality peeps we do this) says he already dug in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we added minced carrots, after the bacon was done, and scrambled the egg in there before the rice. With homemade kimchi :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read your blog religiously but have never commented.  After making this about once every two weeks (ok, sometimes once a week, if I&#039;m being honest) for the last few months as my go-to lazy meal, I feel compelled to thank you for bringing it into my life!  I&#039;ve started adding cubed baked tofu a few minutes after the kimchi is added, and it works great.]]></description>
