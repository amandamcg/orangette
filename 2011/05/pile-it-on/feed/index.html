					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://orangette.net/2011/05/pile-it-on/#comment-24061&quot;&gt;caroline&lt;/a&gt;.

This has been my platonic perfect egg salad for - gasp - nine years now. Wow. And I think I just started my 9 year old avowed mushroom-hater son on a better path, with this salad which I (going forward) will now have to make in doubles quantities.  Thank you for keeping your blog up. It is always a memorable experience to come back to these words that first brought me to recipes that have since rooted in my back pocket.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly - I’ve made this egg salad more times than I have hyperbolics to describe. I’ve made it alone and have eaten it with relish in aloneness. I also made it for my boyfriend and simply said, “I know it looks like cat vomit, but...” and set down the plate. Seven years later we’re now engaged. I’ve been following your blog since I was sixteen - and I’m now 31 and not at all sorry for the math I just set down in front of you. Thank you for this and for your book and your hands, elbows and heart. When my partner and I moved to Orcas Island I made sure we stopped at Delancey and it was truly something special. I’m the head pastry chef now at Roses Bakery and Cafe on Orcas. Stop by anytime with your not so wee one and Ash and I’d love to try and fail repaying you with sweets.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a HUGE egg lover and my husband is crazy for mushrooms so I thought this would be a perfect fit for us!  I made homemade buns and it looked heavenly, but to both of us it just tasted like... potato salad made with mushrooms instead of potato.  In fact several times I caught myself thinking &quot;I should add some potato.&quot;  Not that that made it unpleasant in any way, I just think I prefer my egg salad significantly more eggy, and my potato salad more potato-y.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Read this recipe a few nights ago and just made this for lunch, DH and myself. delicious even without the dill.  Like you, used a smaller amount of Best Foods mayonnaise.  That one is going to be made again and again.  YUM.]]></description>
