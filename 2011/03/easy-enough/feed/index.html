					<description><![CDATA[Moving is such a bore, it&#039;s true, but hopefully you&#039;ll see its rewards fairly soon. We moved recently and I told my husband &#039;this is the last time!&#039; but thankfully you forget when things settle down!  Love your blog - I&#039;m going to try the soup tonight - it sounds amazing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When the plate is overflowing, why not add one more piece of roast? Congrats on the move and good luck settling in. Finally tried the soup tonight. Husband and 4-year-old son were visiting the in-laws and I worked late into the evening. In just 30 minutes I had a steaming bowl of creamy parsnip-y goodness. Just the ticket! This will certainly become a go-to comfort food for me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the parsnip soup recipe. I used it on a crusty old parsnip that had been dug up to make way for my saffron bulbs. The parsnip soup was just magic - unbelieveably sweet.Who&#039;d a thought it! Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds great! I made a roasted parsnip and carrot soup for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it. I will have to try this one. I also love your Pantry idea. I have been tossing around a swap market idea with all hand made, home made items, including foodstuffs, for people in our area. Your blog is very inspirational and I have enjoyed following it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sad to say I don&#039;t even know if I like parsnips, because they are one of those scary vegetables I&#039;ve always avoided (shame on me, right?) But if this soup is anywhere near as good as your green garlic and spinach soup (which I am making right now all the time and LOVING) then I should (and will) give it a try.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this recipe! Not sure if this will be helpful to anyone, but I gave this to my 9 month old twins prior to adding salt. They loved it! One of them is extremely picky, so this will definitely be a keeper.  And my husband and I love it with salt.]]></description>
