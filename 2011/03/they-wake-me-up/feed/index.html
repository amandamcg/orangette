					<description><![CDATA[These were easy to make despite the fact the dough seemed way too heavy.  I ended up using the full 1 1/2 cups of cream in the end, and then when kneading I folded the dough over itself over and over a few times.  Then I rolled it into a ball with everything tucked under, heavily floured the dough and surface so it wouldn&#039;t stick, and rolled it out with a rolling pin in two directions.  It made it so much easier to get it into an oblong shape for cutting and that was uniformly 1/2&quot; thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the person who had the bottoms of the biscuits black I&#039;d suggest trying to cook at a lower temperature for a longer time (if needed).  Maybe it&#039;s the oven.  I didn&#039;t have that problem at all, but I also brushed the bottoms with butter, not just the sides and tops.  Came right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ended up cooking for probably 7 more minutes than stated, checking each minute until the tops were golden brown.  That&#039;s probably just an oven thing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have made these biscuits twice now and I am honestly struggling with them. In order to get them to cook all the way through, I have to bake them to a point where the bottoms burn. The rest of the biscuit is perfect and the outsides are just golden brown, but every time, the bottoms are black. Any tips on how to avoid? Thanks!]]></description>
