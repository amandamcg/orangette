					<description><![CDATA[Molly these are absolutely delicious! I cook radishes quite often in Thai or Far Eastern-inspired stir fries. But I never thought to braise them. The first time I tried this, I had a few dried up sad-looking radishes that had been lingering in my fridge for God knows how long, and a few equally shriveled mushrooms that needed using up. I thought the flavor pairing wouldn&#039;t be off the mark so I threw in the mushrooms along with the radishes. Delicious!&lt;br /&gt;I made these a second time yesterday evening, with bright pink radishes I had bought that same morning. This time they were a feast for the eyes too with their pastel pink hue and little green tops!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great idea!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve done this braising thing with carrots the way the French do but the radishes seem a uniquely piquant variation.  The radishes in my garden are just about right.  Gotta try this!]]></description>
