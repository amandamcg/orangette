					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this beautiful recipe. I made it this afternoon and we had it for dessert for dinner. It was the best part of the meal! At first I was worried I had done something wrong because the cake got quite dark around the edges before it was done in the middle and it took about an hour and fifteen minutes to cook, so I was worried it would be overdone around the edges, but the texture was wonderful throughout the cake.  And it had the perfect balance of almond, butter and salt. I will save this recipe and make it again.]]></description>
