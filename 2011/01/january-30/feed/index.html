					<description><![CDATA[very excited about #2 since i&#039;m about to finish #1 very soon. it&#039;s not your fault i&#039;m reading this book in the dead of february in chicago, but i feel there should have been a protective sleeve/warning over the slow roasted tomatoes recipe. &quot;a do not read unless it&#039;s tomato season&quot; warning. july and august are very far away and that is heartbreaking. silver lining: there was a lot of heavy breathing when i came upon the custard corn bread. i will make it for my birthday dessert in a month. best wishes on #2!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reading your book &quot;A Homemade Life&quot;.  I love, love, love it!  You are writing about your life and recipes and I feel as though I&#039;m reading a John Grisham novel. I don&#039;t want to put it down and I don&#039;t want it to end. I love reading about your dad, he reminds me, in ways, of my dad who died almost 3 years ago.  &lt;br /&gt;This is my first time visiting your BLOG...I know I will enjoy this too.  I love your spirit....&lt;br /&gt;Linda in Utah]]></description>
