					<description><![CDATA[I have been making popovers once a week since Jan 2015, and i stopped late June and just went to make them and the humidity is 50% and they didn&#039;t rise.  I do make them in a real popover pan using the following ingredients...i put 2 eggs in a 2 cup measure to make sure they are 1/2 cup, add 1 1/4 cup milk, 1 tablespoon butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon sugar, and microwave 1 minute.  In a bowl i put 1 1/2 cup reg flour and then mix together when the milk is warm.  I heat the oven which says it is 450 on the thermometer, then spray the pan which has been heating all this time.  Rack is at 1/3 of oven.  Pour batter in using measure cup and put in over.  Cook 20 min and lower over to 350 for 20 min more.  This has worked up until June.  What is wrong????]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[BIG thanks for the dark pan heat tip. I&#039;ve not made popovers since 8th grade home ec and that&#039;s been many, many moons ago. I finally sprung the dough for a popover pan. My hubby had never even heard of them, so for him it was like magic to see them bake! I followed Betty Crocker&#039;s simple recipe and they got so dark, I had to take them out early. On the next attempt, I lowered the oven a few degrees, but still too dark...  They were still good filled with feta + scrambled eggs. Pan came with Rosemary Shallot recipe that sounds savory, but first am going to try your recipe/method and hope for golden results!
