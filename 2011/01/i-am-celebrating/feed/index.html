					<description><![CDATA[I love your blog!  And split pea soup is one of my all-time faves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to mix it up and use either vegetable or chicken stock instead of water, as it makes it more flavorful without confusing the taste of the soup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also add fresh thyme, bay leaf, rosemary,and potatoes, which makes it heartier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#039;s my version:&lt;br /&gt;http://inthekitchenwitheva-eva.blogspot.com/2010/06/soups.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a bit disappointed in this recipe.  I made it exactly as written, including the Benton&#039;s country ham (by mail order, a pricey way to get an ingredient), and it just seems kind of boring.  The ham is absolutely delicious on its own, but in my opinion is kind of wasted in the soup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Molly!....I love most of your recipes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help!  this is the second time I have made this soup, and have loved it both times, but both times it cooked for FOUR HOURS before the peas were mooshy.  I didn&#039;t add salt as I know this can slow down the peas softening but am wondering if you have any insight?  Maybe cooking on too low a heat?  Should it be a simmer or a low boil?  Love the blog, love the book!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this without any ham and it was so good and hearty! It&#039;s a shame it takes 90-120 minutes to cook it but otherwise it&#039;s a really great meal!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here in Norman OK, I too have been having a split pea binge this winter.  Instead of ham, I prefer just using chicken stock for part or all of the water.  I sometimes add celery, sometimes parsley, sometimes a bay leaf. In January my binge morphed into lentil soup--same ingredients and techniques, but sometimes adding garlic. Nothing gets me through an afternoon of OKC teaching like leftover split pea soup at lunch (works better than lentil, but why?).  Well, guess I&#039;ll get into the kitchen right now, where there is a fresh bag of split peas on the island!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Being half French Canadian I was raised on pea soup and ham.  I make it on a regular basis and prefer using my own instincts.  Your recipe is very much what I use including some local, Vermont ham whenever possible.  I have taken to adding some diced celery and it seems to add more of the flavor that I remember growing up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Calhoun, yes, you can definitely take out the ham and put it back in later.  But just so you know, the ham takes up  a lot of room in my (5-quart) Dutch oven, too, and it&#039;s not been a problem: it&#039;s pretty thin and floppy, and I just stir it around with the vegetables.  Hope that helps!]]></description>
