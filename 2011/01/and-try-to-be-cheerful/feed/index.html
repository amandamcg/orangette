Could you send me a pic of her autograph? I have a signed copy I found used in a bookstore and want to confirm if it&#039;s really hers. I can&#039;t imagine someone forging it. Jmc376@gmail.com.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Asian Pear Ginger Muffins: My box of #2 apples from the farmer&#039;s market had some Asian Pears. I added a couple or peeled and very coarsely chopped Asian Pears to the ginger lemon mixture after it has cooled a bit.  To adjust for the moisture in the pears, I subtracted 1/3 c butter milk, added 1/3 c flour, and up-ed the backing powder to a scant teaspoon.  My family likes these even better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[UGH, thank you.  I just hit 7 weeks into my first pregnancy, and I&#039;m feeling it all- fatigue, soreness, and mostly nausea (constantly).  This muffin is perfect eaten crumb-by-crumb early in the morning, and scarfed down late afternoon to tide me over til supper. I weighed 3 oz. of ginger and ended up with almost half a cup of processed ginger, but added it all- and it&#039;s definitely not too much. Love these!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll tell you why you keep the skin on the ginger, and why you get that nice domed shape. the skin of ginger actually contains natural yeast, so when you make the ginger-sugar syrup, you are actually starting a fermentation process. great, right????&lt;br /&gt;this is also the basic recipe for making ginger beer, fyi.]]></description>
