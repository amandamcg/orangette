					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t believe I never tried this recipe until now! I&#039;m glad for the previous experience though - I went a bit off the rails.  I used Jessica&#039;s method of tossing the fruit with the dry ingredients first.  I also subbed in white whole wheat flour and buttermilk - the result is still light and delicious.  Also, I love the food processor butter pulsing method for pastries - but my food processor is a bit small for a recipe as large as this one.  It finally dawned on me to dump out about 2/3 of the flour mixture before pulsing the butter.  Anywho, they are great - I love a scone that comes together this easily.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve made these a few times now, with different fruit each time (PEACHES, y&#039;all, do it), and I&#039;ve found this little tweak to the method really helps to cure that crushing-the-berries ailment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toss your fruit into the dry mixture to blend it well, and then pour the vanilla&#039;ed HnH over top (drizzle it around a bit). I let it sit for about two minutes, then come back and give it a quick 1-2-3 stir, and it&#039;s perfect!]]></description>
