					<description><![CDATA[@ SE - re corn syrup.  No really, corn syrup does contain high fructose corn syrup.  Look at the ingredient list on your corn syrup at home.  Probably it&#039;s Karo and probably it says Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt; Light Corn Syrup, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt, Vanilla. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Studies done by pepsi-cola and corn sugar.com tend to suggest that it gets processed the same as sugar.  Studies done by impartial parties tend to suggest that&#039;s not the case and it&#039;s not real good for you. The Mayo clinic seems to say research is still evolving and don&#039;t consume too much sugar/sugar substitute.  Which is sound advice that as a dessert-with-every-meal person, I certainly don&#039;t follow ;p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#039;s everyone&#039;s own personal choice and tons of professional bakers use corn syrup all the time.  I&#039;m just a sugar gal, and wanted to present alternatives.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, Jeni&#039;s Ice Cream is one of the main things that I miss about living in Columbus, Ohio. (That and the thrift stores, our charming historic neighborhood, and the burgers at Northstar Cafe.) I&#039;ve been meaning to pick up a copy of her book, and this reminded me! My favorite flavor of hers (and I think I probably sampled them all!) is Gravel Road (salty caramel with smoked almonds) and the runner up is lime cardamom yogurt. So amazing.]]></description>
