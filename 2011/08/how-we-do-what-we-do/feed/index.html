					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your writing. I&#039;ve come to realize that it&#039;s a warning sign that I&#039;m afraid of confronting something in that cave whenever I start avoiding writing purposefully. I&#039;m a writer and it&#039;s how I think...even if I find myself not writing regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#039;t seem anyone&#039;s mentioned Twyla tharp&#039;s book The Creative Habit. If sitting down to write is harder than the actual writing she argues training your body to have a routine shortcuts the ability to self doubt and procrastinate. Maybe those writers who &quot;wake up and write every morning&quot; don&#039;t find it any easier-- it&#039;s just what they&#039;ve done for so long, they can&#039;t NOT sit down to that paper each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I also agree with others who talk about the &quot;writing&quot; that happens in your head as you&#039;re processing and creating internally before the itch gets you to sit down and pour it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)]]></description>
