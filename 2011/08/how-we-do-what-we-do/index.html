    <p>I’ve been out of town for the past week, helping with preparations for my cousin’s wedding in Oakland, and the whole time I was gone, I had the strangest feeling. It took me a long time to figure out what it was, because I’d never felt it before. Turns out, I missed writing.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/f6bb0-59550011-11.jpg"><img decoding="async" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5633735809631379474" class="alignnone" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/f6bb0-59550011-11.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="1600" height="1576" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>No offense to my cousin and her new husband. Those people know how to throw a party, the kind that blows out an amp and a subwoofer. But I missed writing. <span style="font-style: italic;">I missed writing</span>! I know that probably seems like a perfectly normal thing to feel, given that writing is what I do. But the truth is, most of the time, I will do anything to avoid it.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/a04a8-5968804722_78322cf150_b1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5633721721466709522" class="alignnone" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/a04a8-5968804722_78322cf150_b1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="1024" height="1008" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I understand that some people wake up itching to write. They feel as though they somehow aren’t complete unless they’re writing. I have never been one of those people. I have wondered what it’s like to be one of those people. Sometimes I have wondered what it would be like to punch those people. I had coffee with a writer friend a couple of weeks ago, a friend who is working on a cookbook, and she confided that she was feeling a little envious of the process that lies ahead of me with <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2011/04/its-still-at-it.html">my next book</a>. You get to do that whole immersion thing, she explained. You get to go headfirst into the cave, the cave where the story is, and there’s nothing else that feels like what that feels like: intense and exhausting, but also electric sometimes, as though you weren’t really alive until you got in there. I knew she was right, and I have occasionally felt that way, but the thing is, getting into the cave is very, very uncomfortable. It’s almost painful. I will do anything to avoid it. I’ve been sitting by the mouth of the cave for four months. I’ve been sweeping my flashlight around on the walls inside, checking for bats, worrying about bats, wondering if I’m going to die from whatever that virus is that’s transmitted in bat guano, wondering if maybe I already have that virus, wondering if that’s why my skin is acting up, and yes, obviously, why didn’t I see it before, <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>’s why I’ve been feeling bloated! I will do anything to avoid going inside. I will make myself miserable, just to avoid it.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/c5f90-polajackoncouch1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5633721722002806594" class="alignnone" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/c5f90-polajackoncouch1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="1120" height="867" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I remember feeling this way when I wrote my first book, and I remember not wanting anyone to know, because I thought I was the only one who feels this way about her work. I have wondered many times if I’m maybe not supposed to be a writer, because I will go to such lengths to avoid writing. I thought it was a sign. When we opened <a href="http://www.delanceyseattle.com/">Delancey</a>, even though it was the hardest work I had ever done, physically and otherwise, I thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">AH HA! I KNEW IT! I wasn’t supposed to be a writer! I’m supposed to run this restaurant! Ding ding ding!</span> But that feeling passed. And though I wasn’t ready to put it into words then, I knew that something wasn’t right, and it was that I wasn’t writing. So here I am, at the cave again.</p>
<p>Brandon and I have been talking a lot about my next book, trying to remember all the details from the earliest days of Delancey, almost two years ago now. Really, the book is as much his as it is mine. A couple of weekends ago, the day after my conversation with my writer friend, Brandon and I went to the farmers’ market to buy a bunch of stuff for the restaurant, and then we went out for a quick lunch before Brandon went to work. I was trying to jog my memory about a particular moment during the opening of the restaurant, a story that I planned to write down that afternoon, and we sat there over our plates of fried rice, hashing out the chronology. I was feeling weird. I felt itchy to get home and start writing, but I also felt like maybe I needed the afternoon off, and maybe tomorrow afternoon, and maybe, you know, maybe I would never write this book at all. And I wondered yet again if this procrastination is a sign that I am in the wrong profession. I suggested this to Brandon. And then he told me something that blew my brain out of my head. Remember how, when I met Brandon, he was studying to be a composer? Apparently, he is an even more accomplished procrastinator than I am: he opened Delancey, he now confesses, to avoid having to write music. World, we have a new Procrastination Champion! I have never felt more thoroughly understood in my entire life.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/0b483-5968786770_c892b0e888_b1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5633721726726016962" class="alignnone" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2015/09/0b483-5968786770_c892b0e888_b1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="1024" height="1009" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And that, that feeling, changed something for me. It made me feel less alone. It made me feel ready to write. And it made me feel ready to go into the cave. Even though it’s still very, <span style="font-style: italic;">very</span> dark in there. Make no mistake.</p>
<p>So I wanted to write this down, this way-too-long post. I remember when <a href="http://www.101cookbooks.com/index.html">Heidi</a> was working on <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSuper-Natural-Every-Day-Well-loved%2Fdp%2F1580082777&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Super Natural Every Day</a></span>, and she would put up a post every now and then to chronicle her process, and how it made me think about my own process and feel more brave about it. Most of us spend our days in some process or other, and I want to share what that process has looked like for me lately. Actually, what I really want is for us to sit around &#8211; you, me, all of us who write or draw or design or compose or do any kind of remotely creative work for a living &#8211; and talk about how we work, how we do what we do. Creative work means making something where there was nothing before, making something out of <span style="font-style: italic;">ourselves</span>. I have a feeling that I’m not only one who spends a lot of time pacing at the mouth of the cave, wringing her hands, worrying about the bats.</p>
<p>I’ve been reading <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBird-Some-Instructions-Writing-Life%2Fdp%2F0385480016%3Fs%3Dbooks%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1312430274%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Bird by Bird</a></span> again. It’s my third time. Brandon has taken to calling it <span style="font-style: italic;">Third by Third.</span> He thinks he’s very clever. In any case, my writing for the next book is currently in what Anne Lamott might call the Shitty First Draft stage, and owwww, is it awkward. So far, the book is very&#8230; workmanlike. But I’m enjoying the process anyway, for the first time. I want to remember that. Anne Lamott says this thing on page xxxi that really resonates with me: &#8220;. . . [S]ometimes when my writer friends are working, they feel better and more alive than they do at any other time. And sometimes when they are writing well, they feel that they are living up to something. It is as if the right words, the true words, are already inside them, and they just want to help them get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw my friend Sam the other night, after a long afternoon of writing, and we were talking and laughing, and he said, &#8220;Wow! You’re really happy when you’ve been writing, aren’t you?&#8221; I didn’t know that about myself. I’m glad I’m learning now.</p>
<p>P.S. If you haven’t heard Elizabeth Gilbert’s <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius.html">TED talk on genius and creativity</a>, do yourself a favor and listen. That’ll light a fire under you.</p>

      <p>Thank you for this! I feel it too, though not just when I have something to write but also in my work as a scientist. New projects are big and daunting as well as exciting and fascinating. I procrastinate and read and run small errands a lot. It&#39;s difficult to accept that one&#39;s &#39;first draft&#39; won&#39;t be neat and precise with well-composed results.</p>
<p>This week I stepped into the cave. 🙂</p>

I don&#39;t use it often for blog photos because the film is expensive, and the development is expensive, and it requires advance planning.  But it&#39;s my favorite camera, by far.</p>

      <p>Oh, so many truths. A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about why I blog. A sense of completion. Funny thing is my little babe sent a post out for me today  that wasn&#39;t ready and then my mouse broke. So now it just out there. Unrefined. Just a skeleton of a finished product and I was shocked how vulnerable it left me feeling. My new mouse will arrive on Monday and then I too will head back to writing.

      <p>Oh my goodness, I&#39;ve been sitting outside for my own cave the past few days and I thought it was just the hormones! 😉 When it comes to writing, especially the Shitty First Draft stage, it&#39;s a little like wrestling with your inner editor/ego, trying to shut it up so that the good stuff can flow and give you something to work from. That wrestling is the hardest, and is probably why I procrastinate so much on writing. Because I want to avoid the battle. Sometimes wine helps, sometimes it doesn&#39;t. Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet, deal with the discomfort and go for it. Works like <i>Bird by Bird</i> certainly help. Go Molly, we&#39;re all rooting for you!</p>

      <p>I have also found that Ted talk moving: posted here on it: <a href="http://jacquelinechurch.com/ldg/1717-ole-ole-ole-toro-restaurant-food-and-the-presence-of-the-divine rel="nofollow"> Ole, Ole, Ole &#8211; Toro, food and the presence of the divine.</a></p>
<p>I have such a different feeling about the writing process, I feel like I could do it all the time, and all the other stuff I <i>have</i> to do gets in the way. </p>
<p>Glad to see your success! Long may it continue!</p>

      <p>There are several books I&#39;ve been meaning to write and one in particular that is banging loudly at the door right now&#8230; if only I&#39;d make the time to go in to the dang cave! 😉</p>

<p>Excessive loitering around the entrance to that cave often tricks me into thinking that perhaps I&#39;m not a writer, after all &#8211; and then, I wonder: what the *!@# am I going to do about these signed contracts and looming deadlines, now that I&#39;ve realised I&#39;m not a writer at all, but just some phony who happens to be good at writing proposals and convincing people that she is a writer?

      <p>Too often I have these exact feelings. There is something intrinsically prone to procrastination in writers but think of the time you now consider wasted as preparation.

      <p>Ah&#8230;the cave analogy totally works for me.  All I do is avoid the cave these days, too.  I&#39;m not exactly sure what part of the cave I&#39;m scared of &#8212; if I were I could overcome it.  And when I finally do get immersed in writing it usually feels good.  But, it takes every bit of focus and energy for me to get myself going.  I write and read blogs to distract myself from my real, academic writing&#8230;and I feel like that&#39;s a pretty encompassing distraction.  A restaurant, though!  That&#39;s impressive. </p>

      <p>Tolkien said he felt he had put his heart up to be shot at after submitting a manuscript. The things we truly love are scary.

      <p>This is an amazing post. It reminds me of a book by Stephen Pressfield called the War of Art, in which he talks about how that which we most resist often tends to be what our true calling is. There are a lot of reasons to avoid writing or composing or painting or whatever, but the greater the friction we feel when we come up against that <i>thing</i> means that that it is what has gotten the most under our skin.</p>

      <p>Wonderful post! I know that feeling so well. I&#39;m starting to make peace with it, starting to understand that it&#39;s also part of the process.

      <p>Molly, I&#39;m a designer, not a writer, but I feel this way all the time too. It&#39;s the tyranny of the blank page, the fear that you won&#39;t be able to do anything good, so you don&#39;t do anything at all. Every time I sit down to start a new project I think, what if nothing comes to me this time? It&#39;s never not come to me, and every time, I just need to learn a little more, turn a few more corners, and I find myself in front of something that might actually work.

      <p>Oh, my heavenly stars. I never knew there were other creative people who did this. I thought it was something broken in me, something inside that couldn&#39;t be more of a finisher and less of a stutter-starter. WOW. I also procrastinate. One of my favorite ways to not write was to cook creatively. When that became uncomfortable, I wrote a cookbook about the way I cooked. When I became unwilling to cook anymore, I began to knit. When I came up with my own patterns, I wrote the knitting patterns. Obviously, I need to write. But I need to overcome a higher level of frustration with the process than I am usually willing to surmount. Hence the long dry writing spells. When the need becomes greater than the frustration with the process, the writing flows and I love the word flow, like a dolphin swimming. Thank you for writing this blog post. I hope you continue writing your process, and helping other writers see their lives through your eyes.</p>

      <p>Such a beautiful post. I can&#39;t wait to read the next book. Have just ordered a copy of Bird by Bird. I too, read your blog when I need some procrastination/inspiration. Like you, I&#39;m sure my blog isn&#39;t so much a cave, it&#39;s more a comfy little tent. But the big writing, the stuff that scares me, that&#39;s a cave. And that one I normally can only enter at dusk, in my special chair, with the comfort of a campari on ice to my left, just in case it all gets too much.</p>

      <p>Thanks for expressing this so beautifully, Molly!  I live in a tent at the mouth of the cave, and each evening at dusk I watch the bats fly out in a vast, fluttering cloud.  And I think to myself, &#8220;Well, no point in going in now.  The bats are gone.&#8221;  In the daytime I think, &#8220;Can&#39;t go in now &#8211; the bats are back and I don&#39;t want to disturb them by stumbling around in their cave, waving a flashlight.  With all that white-nose stuff going on, they don&#39;t need any more stress.&#8221;  Then I spend a lot of time thinking about pollination and spelunking, neither of which is in any way relevant to the two projects &#8211; one writing, one design &#8211; that have been sharing space on the back burner for a long, long time.<br />Life is not comfortable in the tent at the mouth of the cave, but it certainly has become familiar.</p>

      <p>Thank you for sharing this, oh my, of course you are not alone. I feel like that way too often, yet I know I&#39;m doing what I was meant to do! (well, at least I believe so). I&#39;m not a writer, but I remember spending the whole month avoiding looking at all the photographs for my first book and actually starting to put it together. For the next two month I had to almost chain myself to the desk to keep working. It&#39;s getting easier with each new project though, don&#39;t you think?</p>

      <p>Thank you so much for writing so honestly about writing. <br />I spend a lot of extra time working on photography in order to avoid writing, even though I consider myself a writer first and a photographer second.

      <p>This a great post &#8211; AND I love how you write. You are clearly doing something right. </p>
<p>I have a similar feeling when I haven&#39;t been cooking. It&#39;s like a little itch of something missing. Sometimes it results in me in the kitchen cooking at 11 pm (aka my bedtime) or up at 6 am (aka too early). I never really realized the sentiment that makes me do that until I read your post.</p>

      <p>Molly, Thank you for sharing this. Writing is such hard work, but I feel like it&#39;s selfish play, too, because I love it so much. It&#39;s an indulgence. It&#39;s hard to balance the feeling of play and work, especially when there is no money involved&#8230;because all work yields money, right?</p>
<p>I think I do most of my writing in the form of a blog because it&#39;s only on a certain level. Writing something for (paper) publication is deeper and scarier and much, much harder. I don&#39;t know if I have the stuff it takes to write that deep, or, as you say, go into the cave. So, until I work up the courage and confidence, I&#39;ll blog.</p>
<p>(And, oh yes, I love Bird by Bird. It&#39;s on my shelf.)</p>

      <p>Molly,  Wonderful post!  I am not a writer but I find myself &#8220;outside the cave&#8221; with regard to other areas of my life and responsibilities I have.  Also, I was in Seattle two weeks ago and I told the friend I was visiting I had only one request:  to eat at Delancey.  Turns out she lives relatively close so it was easy to do.  We both loved it and I know she&#39;s been back at least once since then.  I&#39;m looking forward to reading your next book!  Good luck with the bats.</p>

      <p>YES.  I feel this way about my research (I&#39;m a PhD student in mathematics).  It&#39;s hard for me to come to terms with the fact that my first idea (and my second, and my third, etc) will almost certainly not pan out &#8212; and then to persevere, to keep searching for the right idea, having faith that it will show up eventually.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be very tempting to say &#8220;Well, even if I work on research today, odds are I won&#39;t get any results, so I might as well spend hours wandering around the internet.&#8221;  I have to keep reminding myself that the time and energy invested in those first fruitless ideas isn&#39;t time wasted.</p>

      <p>It&#39;s refreshing to read such a brave post that reveals your creative doubts. We all have them and to see that makes it so much more acceptable to feel them. I am currently going through a phase where I&#39;m not sure where my cave is at all. But perhaps that&#39;s my creative doubt speaking and really I&#39;m at the mouth of the cave looking into the darkness while backing off.

      <p>Molly, thank for for writing about something that people don&#39;t often talk about, but so often go through. Part of the reason I recently began my blog was because I no longer have an outlet for writing in my &#8220;real&#8221;job, and it definitely feels good to be writing again. But there are still days when it makes me very, very uncomfortable, even  anxious. For me, part of it is that I feel I have to recreate in my mind whatever it is I&#39;m writing about, and to do that, I have to get to that same place emotionally&#8230; which isn&#39;t always fun. Thanks for the reminder that I&#39;m not alone 🙂</p>

      <p>I love this post because, honestly, I have long felt the exact same way. Deep down I consider myself a writer&#8230; who doesn&#39;t write. I&#39;ve never done much writing other than for school, but my teachers always told me how good I was and I was always so proud of myself after finishing a piece. But the thing was: I was such a procrastinator and it would take me FOREVER to even start. I&#39;m a perfectionist and I wanted what I was writing to be perfect and I would end up driving myself crazy. I love to write, and yet&#8230; I hate it! </p>
<p>So it feels great to know that I&#39;m not alone in this and that I guess I can still consider myself a writer without feeling guilty. And you&#39;ve given me hope that maybe someday I will write more&#8230; </p>
<p>Thank you 🙂</p>

      <p>Thank you, SO MUCH, for this post. My goodness. I&#39;m a freelancer. I spend *hours* pacing at the cave&#8211; and yes, those bats are freaking terrifying.

      <p>Hi Molly, I&#39;ve always been so curious about your writing process and have to admit I loved hearing that you sometimes struggle like this. Your writing is so beautiful and it&#39;s hard to not assume it&#39;s effortless for you, and that these words just fall into place easily. I consider myself a writer and feel like I have so much I want to write about, but with two little boys, I never have adequate time to really focus on my writing and coax the right words out, so for the most part, I just put it off altogether. I hope that changes some day. For now, I&#39;m going to order Bird by Bird since this is the second time I&#39;ve heard about it this week. And I can&#39;t wait to read your second book since your first was so fabulous.</p>

      <p>Miss Molly, you have no idea how much I needed this post right now.  I feel like the queen of ADD as the moment I have a deadline fast-approaching, I find a million other things that &#8220;must&#8221; be done. And, as writing is not my &#8220;thing&#8221; &#8211; photography is &#8211; it is a stretch on a good day. And yet, I know I can do it, and actually enjoy it, a little.  So this post inspires me to be a little more gentle with myself and just enjoy the process, with all of it&#39;s ups and downs.<br />Thank you.</p>

      <p>Beautiful.  Thank you for your honesty.  I often avoid my own cave for fear of finding inside the Horrible Truth that I&#39;m just no good,  not a cavern of wonders, but a dead end after a belly slog through suffocating fissures. It&#39;s good to know that even the successful(that&#39;s you!)have to override their demon resistance.  The only secret seems to be to just do what you&#39;re led to do anyway. I need to remember that when I start pretending to be a culinary school baking instructor in two weeks.  That&#39;s a scary cave, too.</p>

      <p>What a beautiful post Molly! I adore Anne Lamott because she gives you a kick in the rear when you feel like stopping and the grace to say whatever this attempt ends up looking like, it&#39;s OK.</p>

      <p>How inspiring. Sometimes, just hearing how another comes to the conclusions they come to and how that process and reveal takes place can really help someone else understand his circumstance, even if it isn&#39;t the same thing. I have not commented in a  while, (I&#39;m sure you noticed, ha! 🙂 But I read every post and am a huge fan your your book. You are a very thoughtful writer and a subtle, brilliant storyteller. You make me want to make whatever it is you are talking about even if it&#39;s something initially unappealing to me like braised cabbage. You will talk about the how the delicate leaves wilt and marry with the cream and turn into something completely different, all it&#39;s own and I am somehow itching to get to the store and buy me some cabbage! You do it all without pushing it, as I tend to do, and it&#39;s really very nice and beautiful. Keep writing Molly. Sometimes we have to get uncomfortable to get comfortable. Go kick some bat-ass!</p>

      <p>Molly, thank you so much for your bravery in sharing this. I am trying to finish my dissertation in the next few months, and I cannot tell you how many times in the last seven years I have felt just what you are feeling, have employed all the same miserable methods of procrastination, have wondered endlessly if I am in the wrong profession. You have no idea how much it has helped me, and, doubtless, so many others, just to see this daily struggle verbalized by someone as honest and talented as you are. I am in the dark cave with you, believing that the light will come.</p>

      <p>Molly, thank you so much for your bravery in sharing this. I am trying to finish my dissertation in the next few months, and I cannot tell you how many times in the last seven years I have felt just what you are feeling, have employed all the same miserable methods of procrastination, have wondered endlessly if I am in the wrong profession. You have no idea how much it has helped me, and, doubtless, so many others, just to see this daily struggle verbalized by someone as honest and talented as you are. I am in the dark cave with you, believing that the light will come.</p>

      <p>Dear Molly,<br />I love reading your blog and I especially love your long posts. Apart from giving me a reputation of being a good cook, you give me a sense of peace with your beautiful sentences in your blog and book.<br />My books will most probably always stay a collection of notes and pages but I am very happy you are heading into your cave.</p>

      <p>Molly, find your blog earlier this year led me to your book, which together inspired me to start photographing and writing about my adventures in the kitchen.

      <p>You know what happens in New England when you&#39;re exposed to bats? They give you shots. A lot of shots. For reasons that I don&#39;t quite understand. They don&#39;t even have to touch you, and &#8212; tough luck &#8212; you gotta get the shots. Plural. </p>
<p>Right now, the bats are stuck in my hair, the way my grandmother always promised me they&#39;d be if I ever saw some and harassed them. Which means, since I live in New England, I&#39;m lining up for the shots.</p>

      <p>Thank you so much for this post!  Procrastinators unite!  I have actually taken on an entire career, which is nothing more than daily tedium and attention to details that I care nothing about, in order to put off doing what I&#39;m really meant to do.  I&#39;m a certified yoga instructor, and I taught some classes, but its been several years ago.  I live in a small town, so demand for yoga classes is not high.  I took my current job to make ends meet, and its slowly managed to &#8220;eat up&#8221; every other aspect of my life.  I don&#39;t even practice my own yoga any more!  Why do we do this?  Everytime I do yoga, it feels like just exactly what I need.  I think its maybe some kind of protection mode.  A wanting to protect that part of me which is most authentic and beautiful.  Not wanting to risk having that part of me rejected.  So instead, I just pretend to be something that I absolutely am not.  It is not a good strategy.  Thanks for your willingness to put your true self out there.  I think I&#39;ll go sit by the cave for a while, and if I don&#39;t break out in hives, I&#39;ll consider going in.  </p>
<p>Much love to you.</p>

      <p>Hey, I have a cave, too. I don&#39;t think about bats too often (my best friend is a bat biologist &#8211; maybe that&#39;s why?).

<p>It doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;m pulled three ways. I have my academic writing, my food writing, and my fiction writing; each one makes the others better, I think, but I also have a job.</p>

      <p>Molly, I draw. And I sometimes feel like there&#39;s a whole street lined up with caves around me. I still battle the feeling that apparently i should find another profession. Your words strengthen my resolve to give it my all.</p>

      <p>Thank you for sharing this!  I think a lot of writers feel the same way when starting new pieces.  I love that feeling when there are words on the page, when I can get in a writing groove and move sentences and paragraphs around, when the whole story starts to come together.  But I absolutely hate the blank page and that moment of starting.  I&#39;d rather eat a whole hot pepper.  Or at least a bite &#8211; and I don&#39;t have a high tolerance for spice.  </p>
<p>Your post makes me think of Ann Patchett&#39;s Truth &#038; Beauty.  Have you read it?  It&#39;s a story about friendship, really, but Ann mentions that her friend Lucy does everything possible to avoid starting her second book.  It was the first time I read that someone else struggles with starting a piece, and it made me feel so much better.  </p>
<p>Anyway, good luck with the book!</p>

      <p>Great post! I feel like that about making sculpture&#8211;I love it and loathe it at the same time. I&#39;m afraid to get started yet I&#39;m grouchy because I&#39;m not working. I have a friend who confided in me that he loves ceramics so much that he has to restrain himself from running as fast as he can into his studio. I really hate him sometimes.</p>

      <p>Yes! I was going to comment and recommend that Elizabeth Gilbert TED talk, which I adore and in which I find great comfort, but there it is waiting for us in your post script! </p>
<p>I, too, am glad to know I&#39;m not the only one pacing the mouth of the cave. My great dread and greatest achievement arrives in lesson planning&#8211;creative, academic, thoughtful, careful.

      <p>This is a lovely way to describe the balance between the writing and not. Can&#39;t have one without the other and there&#39;s no purpose in feeling guilt (or anything else) when engaged in either! I love to think of my non-writing time as research because that&#39;s when everything experienced and observed can be drawn from the next time I&#39;m BICHOK 🙂</p>

      <p>I love that you&#39;re brave enough to share that you get scared at the mouth of the cave. Pacing around in front of that yawning, black hole could make you (or, me) want to do just about anything else. But I find that once I dive in, and am persistent (even when I don&#39;t feel like it), it tends to get easier. Shitty first drafts, telling the story in inch-wide picture frames, and turning the KFKD radio station off are my favorite chapters of Bird by Bird. Bonne chance! You&#39;re going to rock it.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m a writer. I love having written. I love it when I lose myself. It takes a lot of work to lose oneself. It&#39;s not instant &#8211; sit down and you&#39;re lost (well&#8230; maybe I am lost but without losing myself!) Maybe &#39;tis time to crack open Bird by Bird again. Congrats on the NY Times Delancey review &#8211; that&#39;s a lovely coup! Will be in Seattle next week &#8211; just the days when Delancey is closed! But will still dream of that white pizza.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m a writer. I love having written. I love it when I lose myself. It takes a lot of work to lose oneself. It&#39;s not instant &#8211; sit down and you&#39;re lost (well&#8230; maybe I am lost but without losing myself!) Maybe &#39;tis time to crack open Bird by Bird again. Congrats on the NY Times Delancey review &#8211; that&#39;s a lovely coup! Will be in Seattle next week &#8211; just the days when Delancey is closed! But will still dream of that white pizza.</p>

      <p>I swear I am not making this up. I wouldn&#39;t do that. But it was procrastinating writing that found me reading this post. Not only do I feel the way you do, but I feel that way right at this very moment. I&#39;ve always been terrified of this thing Rilke said- that you must search the depths of your soul, and if you do not truly, honestly NEED to write, then you are not meant to. That is what has always made me think that I&#39;m doing the wrong thing. I thought I wasn&#39;t worthy because I&#39;m so lousy at actually following through with it. But I think we&#39;re both on the right track. Thanks for reminding me, and good luck with the cave!</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been standing at the edge of the cave for over three years now. I have a photo project I love and know is good, but I can&#39;t bring myself to do anything with it or create more work. The fear of what&#39;s on the other end of the cave can be paralyzing.

      <p>YOU WONDERFUL PEOPLE!  I love the conversation that&#39;s happening here, and all the books and ideas and quotes you&#39;ve shared!  Thank you.  So, so much.  I&#39;m going to come back and read these comments over and over, I think, whenever I&#39;m stuck.</p>
<p>And to those who asked about the camera I used, photos 1, 2, and 4 were taken with a Hasselblad 500c/m.  It&#39;s a medium-format film camera, and it&#39;s an incredible piece of machinery.  Fanciest camera I will probably ever own.  I&#39;m in love with it.  And the third photo was taken with a Polaroid 600, using Fuji instant film.</p>

      <p>I loved reading this and it is so inspiring to hear about your process, however difficult, and more so your discovery of the importance of writing in your life.</p>
<p>I wish that creative endeavors could go quickly from point a to point b, but I am learning that sometimes the things that sneak up on you, that you didn&#39;t know you cared so much about, end up being the best and most important.</p>

I completely understand what you are talking about with the procrastination and the avoidance, I&#39;ve been gearing up for a very big challenge that I will face tomorrow and even though the training has been so very gratifying each time I have to push myself I avoid it like the plague.  But your post is so INSPIRING!  I have no other word, inspiring is it.  Good luck with the writing, I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on your next book.  Thanks again. M&#038;M</p>

      <p>Oh Sweetie, You are NOT alone! I&#39;m a quiltmaker and I bubble over constantly with ideas and sometimes I do the mouth-of-the-cave number you were writing about over one of these fantastic ideas. It&#39;s blue fear, basically. But I can assure you that once I start cutting up fabric and putting different colors together, the cave doesn&#39;t seem like a frightful place anymore. I get swept along into the idea that was fantastic to begin with and I forget about the walls of the cave altogether. Be well, Sweetie, your writing is wonderful!</p>

      <p>Wonderful post for all of us who sit outside caves waiting until  that random perfect moment comes, and then we create!  I am often afraid the creative fire is lost, but have learned it will always reappear if I wait and watch.</p>

      <p>Molly, thank you so much for this post. Not only was it beautifully written (like virtually everything you write), but it really struck a cord with me. I&#39;m just finishing my master&#39;s degree and have been battling with the idea of pursuing a Phd in literature, and the reason I&#39;m not running headlong into it is because it&#39;s so hard for me to write my academic papers. To paraphrase what one of the commenters quoted: it&#39;s not the writing that&#39;s hard, it&#39;s the sitting down to write. When I&#39;m in the middle of a paper, completely in &#8220;the cave,&#8221; to borrow your gorgeous metaphor, it&#39;s downright exhilarating. But when I&#39;m at the edge of the cave, not yet in, it&#39;s so damn frightening. In fact, I get so scared that I doubt my ability to even be able to write a paper at all. And lord, do I procrastinate. Sometimes, when I&#39;m at this stage, I&#39;ll read a paper I&#39;ve written in the past, and be shocked that I could possibly have written it, and start feeling like I could never write anything like that again. Getting into the cave is so difficult, that it&#39;s made me doubt that an academic career is for me. And yet, there&#39;s no greater satisfaction for me then when I&#39;ve finished a paper&#8230; This post, and all of the comments here, have made me feel like maybe it&#39;s ok that I feel this way, maybe it doesn&#39;t mean that I shouldn&#39;t go down this career path, that maybe I should, after all, follow my heart.</p>

      <p>Dear Molly, </p>
<p>What a brave and important post. It has taken me a few days to really think about what I wanted to write. </p>
<p>As someone who has only been writing for a few months and as someone who is totally inspired by your writing it was interesting to hear how you were feeling. I would love to be where you are now and it is tough knowing that I may never be good enough. I guess it just shows that whatever level you are at in the creative process you will always have that feeling of self doubt. </p>
<p>My boyfriend is an artist and he always talks to me about &#8220;climbing mount improbable&#8221;. It&#39;s like being at the bottom of a cliff face looking up at the summit. It looks scary and impossible but it&#39;s much easier to go round the back and take little, gradual steps and eventually you will get to the top. Well that is the idea anyways. </p>
<p>Also, when I am doing drawings I am always worried about mucking it up. When I think about it rationally it is only a piece of paper that is wasted, it is really no dramas. With writing it is just the same. </p>
<p>Having just read a homemade life a few weeks ago I know you have it in you to do an amazing second book. </p>
<p>Best wishes<br />Ruthie x</p>

It makes me feel incredibly vulnerable, and rather fearful too.<br />Thank you for posting. Your writing style is beautiful. I always feel calmer after I&#39;ve read something you&#39;ve written.</p>

      <p>I always love writing once I&#39;m in the thick of it, but I also always put off starting for days&#8230;months&#8230;YEARS. I need to tattoo &#8220;WRITE TODAY&#8221; across my fingers.

      <p>Wow, I am so glad you wrote this. I (and I see from all the comments &#8211; so many other people, amazingly) feel the same way!

      <p>Such an apt description, Molly.  Thanks for sharing!  It&#39;s funny, but I&#39;ve been muttering, &#8220;you&#39;ll do it bird by bird,&#8221; a lot to myself lately, trying to do my work, to do at least some work.  I&#39;ve been having to admit to myself that through all these years where I&#39;ve described myself as a &#8220;process-oriented person,&#8221; I&#39;ve been describing myself aspirationally.  Most of the time I don&#39;t like process at all!  It is itchy and anxiety producing &#8211; and you start to think your genius really is totally lame &#8211; just as you describe.  But, on the days when you do embrace the process, oh how lovely those days are.  Living is a process.

      <p>Oh my. I was sitting here at my computer tonight, procrastinating about writing a new article for my cooking blog, and I thought &#8220;I hope Molly has a new post at Orangette. Reading her blog always makes me feel good.&#8221; </p>
<p>So I did and I loved it and I totally empathize about sitting at the mouth of the cave &#8211; that&#39;s where I am now, too &#8211; and when I got to the part about Bird By Bird, I laughed out loud!

If I had to tally up the times I&#39;ve read Bird by Bird, it would be in the dozens; usually, I read a chapter or two until I&#39;m out of my funk and ready to write again. </p>

      <p>Dear Molly, </p>
<p>You are an excellent writer. I cried reading you first book, the chapter about your heartbreak in Paris sang to me. I feel the same about writing sometimes, I&#39;m a dietitian and I often doubt that I&#39;m a good writer, I&#39;m better off counseling people and teaching others. But I find such joy in writing, it&#39;s amazing when the words just flow seamlessly though. I can&#39;t wait for your next book! Don&#39;t be afraid of the cave!</p>

      <p>Phew. I thought I was losing my mind and that I must be the most lazy, immature, irresponsible person ever. To find myself avoiding writing or creating pictures to clean out under my bathroom counter? What&#39;s wrong with me? So thanks for sharing. And I too am in the middle of reading Bird by Bird. It makes me feel sane. I think I&#39;ll read it each year for therapy of sorts.</p>

      <p>Phew. I thought I was losing my mind and that I must be the most lazy, immature, irresponsible person ever. To find myself avoiding writing or creating pictures to clean out under my bathroom counter? What&#39;s wrong with me? So thanks for sharing. And I too am in the middle of reading Bird by Bird. It makes me feel sane. I think I&#39;ll read it each year for therapy of sorts.</p>
<p>Thanks again. Wishing you much luck in the cave.</p>

      <p>Ha! Looks like this resonated with quite a few people. 🙂 I&#39;m a graphic designer and wow, I&#39;m right there with you on the cave. And that there is no better feeling than when you&#39;re fully immersed and producing. But oh man, getting there. Hard. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve found it&#39;s A LOT easier to brave the cave for clients. When I&#39;m doing my own work, whew, it languishes for weeks/months/years(ouch!). Until I feel like perhaps I&#39;m not really a designer&#8230;</p>
<p>But, all it takes is one really good afternoon and I realize designing brings me more satisfaction and happiness than anything I&#39;ve ever done before. </p>
<p>Glimpses of brilliance! And enjoying those languishing moments, without drowning in them. These are my goals. Great post!!!</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your feelings about writing, the ups and downs. Thanks for your honesty! As a painter, I can relate to you far too well. <br />I feel like I&#39;m usually fighting myself in the studio, or avoiding the studio altogether- but it always calls me back, a language I can&#39;t forsake because it is the best way I can say what I have to say. It&#39;s my best form communication in a sense, because it gets the deepest inside of me.<br />Anyway, not to get all mushy, but thanks for sharing with others the truths of what it is like for you as a writer.</p>

      <p>Molly, reading your thoughts shifted something inside me. thank you. i never realized other creators feel the way you describe. all my life ive been throwing myself from one thing to the next in an effort to avoid those things i love doing (the more love there is, the greater the velocity). my path has included loss of identity (needed, i see now), addiction, public humiliation, and a large amount of nerve-splitting, body-shaking fear. all because i couldnt face my desires, and the work it takes to actualize them, squarely. </p>
<p>thank you for sharing your thoughts and the TED video. both continue to resound in my head as they rearrange my perspective. </p>

      <p>One of the reasons I blog at all is to document my creative journey &#8212; the bumps in the road as well as the triumphs &#8212; partly in the hope that when I hit a rough patch I can get some perspective. And it&#39;s also in the vague hope that others may find it reassuring or helpful.

      <p>I certainly relate to this post and your process and both your and Brandon&#39;s procrastination. I guess the important thing is to hang on. To not let our desire to run away or sweep the front of the cave make us think we are doing that because we have nothing inside us to give. Maybe that procrastination in and of itself is a key part of our own idiosyncratic process and all we can do is keep moving toward it, and hope we outlast it.</p>

      <p>I am so thankful that you wrote this post, Molly! I feel EXACTLY the same way. I loved where you said, &#8220;I wonder what it would feel like to punch those people&#8221;. The people who tell you that you aren&#39;t really a writer if you aren&#39;t writing every day. Grr&#8230;.</p>
<p>I love writing&#8230;once I get into it. But when life has intervened, and it&#39;s been a while, it&#39;s excruciating to get back to it. Even though I miss it. Even though I feel guilty about not writing every single day. If my day job was writing novels, I know I could write everyday, but trying to balance my fiction writing with my PR writing and my journalism can be hell on earth.</p>
<p>Good to know someone else has the same struggles.</p>

      <p>I am so thankful that you wrote this post, Molly! I feel EXACTLY the same way. I loved where you said, &#8220;I wonder what it would feel like to punch those people&#8221;. The people who tell you that you aren&#39;t really a writer if you aren&#39;t writing every day. Grr&#8230;.</p>

      <p>What a fantastic post! Love your analogy to a cave. I think sometimes the things we are best at/enjoy the most are the hardest to get started at because we a) either know we will become so wrapped up everything else goes on the backburner or b) have such daunting high expectations. Either way, looking forward to your work 🙂</p>

      <p>Dear Molly </p>
<p>I discovered you and your blog by some strange coincidence a few months ago. I read your blog just now again after some well timed coincidence.

<p>The man I love prefers to see me writing to the early hours of the morning even if this means I am tired the next day because I shine and glow with happiness. And today I just writing again and added to a blog I had almost abandoned. </p>
<p>I would be honoured if you read my post but equally I can&#39;t wait to read your old and new books in the future. </p>

      <p>Hello Molly, <br />I&#39;ve been reading your blog for a while now, (I also loved your 1st book and am quite psyched for the 2nd one). I just moved to Seattle this year and am also a writer, or trying to be in my free time as a pre-school teacher down in West Seattle. Anyway, I just wanted to say how much this post helped me to understand my own writing process and put a visual to how I feel at the moment. I too am stuck standing in front of the cave fighting going in, despite how much I want to be inside. The fear is winning right now, but I know it won&#39;t be for long. </p>
<p>My issue is that I&#39;m standing just in the entrance where about three or four caves splinter off in their own direction and I cannot decide which one to dive into. They might all lead to the same center, but I&#39;m still not sure which path to take. Thank you for providing the visual to a feeling that I have felt far too often, and like you worried I was the only writer who often dreaded doing the one thing I know brings me to life: being dead center in the middle of the cave with my laptop, my books, and my notes. I miss being in the middle of the dark. Good luck to you taking that first step inside! Oh, and I just watched that same TED talk last week with EG, she is wonderful 🙂</p>

      <p>Your post here resonated, oh yes, it did. I envy all of you folks who are able to go into the cave, or even shine the flashlight in and look around. I&#39;m still living on the outside, way down here in the valley&#8230;but I&#39;d like to go up there and go inside and see what&#39;s there. But you think you&#39;re scared?&#8230;man, I&#39;m just alookin&#39; at the cave from way off in the distance sorta sideways like. Too nervous or unsure of myself to get any closer.

And I read &#8220;The Writing Life&#8221; by Annie Dillard recently and just finished Stephen King&#39;s &#8220;On Writing&#8221; and.. well you get the picture.  Now I just need to, well, write.  Thanks for sharing your struggles too!</p>

      <p>Molly, I feel for you. Maybe calling philosophy papers &#8220;creative writing&#8221; is a bit of a stretch, but it still requires imagination and a lot of searching for the right words, the right way to approach something. So there. It&#39;s what I&#39;m supposed to be doing as a grad student, and like you, it&#39;s what I often avoid doing&#8230;to the point where I wonder whether philosophy and I are meant to be. I think we writers all go through periods like this. I wish I had more to say about how to get through them, but really, I think it&#39;s just a matter of patience, friends, and continued confidence in yourself.</p>

      <p>Wow&#8230;where to start? </p>
<p>I should be working on a blog post for Hello Giggles. I sent them a pitch, they liked it, and now I just have to write it. I also should be doing the work I actually get paid to do (aka, my &#8220;day job&#8221;), which has absolutely nothing to do with the career that I&#39;m shooting for. Instead, I&#39;m pinning pretty images on Pinterest (aka, internet crack) and reading my favorite blogs. </p>
<p>I loved Bird by Bird, and I also adore Elizabeth Gilbert. I was lucky enough to see EG speak at UW when she was in Seattle a few years ago. I&#39;ve been thinking about her &#8220;monkey mind&#8221; stories&#8230;once she missed her flight (when she was actually sitting at the gate!!!) because her mind was jumping from subject to subject so much that she didn&#39;t even notice that her flight was boarding. That&#39;s kind of how I feel when I&#39;m clicking all over the internet instead of adding words to my empty page. </p>
<p>Now I&#39;m going to focus. Seriously. I loved A Homemade Life and can&#39;t wait for your next book! 🙂</p>

<p>I&#39;m especially in awe of how you have woven recipes into your life experiences. I&#39;ve never seen it done quite like that. It&#39;s precious.</p>

      <p>yes, I just cried a little while I felt excited at the same time.  presque vu (almost seeing), right?  I have felt that for so long. . . the feeling that I have so many words to write, so many stories, so many things to elucidate.  I wrote when I was young and was encouraged by so many teachers but when I went to college I put it off by majoring in different subjects than English.  Once I was brave enough to tell someone I wanted to be a writer but when he asked what I wanted to write about it put me into eternal procrastination.  I figured I needed to live first.  So I tried to become a dancer and then I did become a wife and mother, a chef, then I opened a restaurant.  I am slowly putting stories on paper, finally, and softly laughing at myself as I look back and ask why it took so long.  I thank you for talking about this and helping me examine my process and my inability to head on into that cave.  I admire you so!  You are very, very brave and a light for me.</p>

      <p>yes, I just cried a little while I felt excited at the same time.  presque vu (almost seeing), right?  I have felt that for so long. . . the feeling that I have so many words to write, so many stories, so many things to elucidate.  I wrote when I was young and was encouraged by so many teachers but when I went to college I put it off by majoring in different subjects than English.  Once I was brave enough to tell someone I wanted to be a writer but when he asked what I wanted to write about it put me into eternal procrastination.  I figured I needed to live first.  So I tried to become a dancer and then I did become a wife and mother, a chef, then I opened a restaurant.  I am slowly putting stories on paper, finally, and softly laughing at myself as I look back and ask why it took so long.  I thank you for talking about this and helping me examine my process and my inability to head on into that cave.  I admire you so!  You are very, very brave and a light for me.</p>

      <p>My gosh, this post spoke to me. I always wanted to be a creative writer. And what did I do when I graduated from college and couldn&#39;t find a job? I went back to school and got a MBA! I essentially ran away from my creativity, scared that I would waste my time on crap. It&#39;s only been recently, since I had a baby and left work, that I force myself to &#8220;do something for me&#8221; that I&#39;ve returned to writing.</p>

      <p>Molly,<br />I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever posted on your blog or not, but I felt I needed to comment on this entry. I actually just finished reading <i>A Homemade Life</i> and I loved it. </p>
<p>The similarities in our childhoods were eerie to me&#8230;I&#39;m also a 2nd marriage only child with oldest half sister and two half brothers who was taught to love the kitchen by my experimental-gourmet-father and follow-the-book-baker-mother. Ok, the similarities mostly end there, but this is to say reading your book felt like having a conversation with an old friend. </p>
<p>I love the movement between story and recipe, I felt as if I were sitting at your kitchen table hearing your life story as you whipped up delicious food. There&#39;s definitely a place in the world for writing like that, so please, keep doing it!</p>

      <p>I loved your post. I think procrastination is part of writing, of any creative endeavor. I&#39;m feeling particularly motivated these days and procrastination seems like a foreign land. When I&#39;m feeling motivated I always foolishly think it will be like that from now on. I go around thinking/feeling I am now and forever more a diligent and productive person. When I&#39;m procrastinating I feel the same way but opposite- I will never be productive again.</p>
<p>I think the question is how do you feed your soul so that you feel inspired to show up everyday? At least that is the question on my mind lately. I know there are things that I have to do everyday like reading and meditating to feel whole and inspired. Like you, I&#39;m curious about how people work and how they do what they do.  </p>

      <p>How accurately you describe the procrastination that seems to go hand in hand with my creative process! Sometimes I just have to have a stern talk with myself and force myself to enter the cave, just to take the first step inside. Such a struggle!</p>

      <p>What a beautiful post. I am just coming off of a year with my new baby where I was immersed in him&#8230;and my writing. All of my creative energy was spent daydreaming, planning, crafting and composing. As I return to my day job I find my mind constantly drifing back to how I will set back at my computer to write again. The biggest challenge is how to balance my compulsive need to communicate with the rest of life, including my new family.</p>

      <p>Thank you so much for sharing this &#8211; it&#39;s always so comforting to have the people you admire greatly confess to the same fears, insecurities and semi-deranged coping strategies that you yourself have! Procrastinators unite!<br />I can so perfectly relate to pacing at the foot of the cave &#8211; it&#39;s so hard to go to that place of truth inside yourself. It can be a beautiful and exhilarating process, but often it can be exhausting and SO difficult, and not many people will admit to that.<br />I think that&#39;s the great thing about stepping away for a few days though, you finally figure out what really matters when you can gaze at your life from a small distance. <br />Love that Elizabeth Gilbert speech by the way, and am ordering Bird by Bird 🙂</p>

      <p>along with Bird by Bird&#8230;I&#39;m going to re-read this post when i find myself running errands to avoid writing or starting anything new that has anything to do with expressing myself creatively.  i read a quote last week that got me out of the cave&#8230; &#8220;Everything that is not given is lost&#8230;&#8221; Including our words and energy toward the things that touch our heart&#8230; Sharing is good &#8220;giving&#8221; practice.

      <p>Molly, you made me gasp in recognition and laugh out loud. I am a writer and musician/composer. I will gladly &#8220;just write&#8221; to avoid the music. Somehow for me, the writing has no ego, so I don&#39;t care if I write crap. The music must be perfect, since I spent my life energy, education and $$ immersed in it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I use a reward system for writing. I used to say, &#8220;I&#39;ll write this darn article if I can watch Grey&#39;s Anatomy at the same time.&#8221; That&#39;s the only way I&#39;d sit down to do it! Lucky for me, I had a chill editor and managed to eek these things out&#8230;</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m like, if you finish this query letter (which usually gets good response, but is really a dog &#038; pony show to &#8220;convince&#8221; an agent/editor that I&#39;m a real writer, which of course I&#39;m not), then you can go to a movie later! or have pizza, etc.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t function creatively without rewards. Every day. Write on, Molly! Looking forward to reading more from you&#8230;</p>

<p>Anyway, I use a reward system for writing. I used to say, &#8220;I&#39;ll write this darn article if I can watch Grey&#39;s Anatomy at the same time.&#8221; That&#39;s the only way I&#39;d sit down to do it! Lucky for me, I had a chill editor and managed to eek these things out&#8230;</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m like, if you finish this query letter (which usually gets good response, but is really a dog &#038; pony show to &#8220;convince&#8221; an agent/editor that I&#39;m a real writer, which of course I&#39;m not), then you can go to a movie later! or have pizza, etc.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t function creatively without rewards. Every day. Write on, Molly! Looking forward to reading more from you&#8230;</p>

      <p>Molly, your post really resonated with me. I am a new blogger and I feel exactly the way you describe every time I sit down to write a post &#8211; anything to stay outside the cave! I haven&#39;t read Anne Lamott, but what she says makes a lot of sense. Time to buy a book I think:) Thanks for this wonderful post!</p>

      <p>Hi Molly! I just started reading Orangette, and love it!  I&#39;ve been thinking recently about a lot of the things you wrote about in this post, so I really appreciated reading your thoughts. I&#39;ve been exploring my own creative process lately with the help of Julia Cameron&#39;s book, The Artist&#39;s Way.  Have you heard of it? It kind of makes me feel like a crazy person at times, but is really amazing</p>

      <p>Thank you for your writing. I&#39;ve come to realize that it&#39;s a warning sign that I&#39;m afraid of confronting something in that cave whenever I start avoiding writing purposefully. I&#39;m a writer and it&#39;s how I think&#8230;even if I find myself not writing regularly.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t seem anyone&#39;s mentioned Twyla tharp&#39;s book The Creative Habit. If sitting down to write is harder than the actual writing she argues training your body to have a routine shortcuts the ability to self doubt and procrastinate. Maybe those writers who &#8220;wake up and write every morning&#8221; don&#39;t find it any easier&#8211; it&#39;s just what they&#39;ve done for so long, they can&#39;t NOT sit down to that paper each morning.</p>
<p>But I also agree with others who talk about the &#8220;writing&#8221; that happens in your head as you&#39;re processing and creating internally before the itch gets you to sit down and pour it out.</p>
