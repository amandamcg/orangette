					<description><![CDATA[I just started reading your book, and must tell you that of the many things I&#039;ve read since we lost my father in law this past spring, your chapter on your dad really hit me in a way nothing else has(in a bittersweet, good way).  One minute Dad was here, and then he wasn&#039;t and -- like your dad -- we felt there was still much unfinished.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was not much of a cook, but he was an ace at grinding cranberries for the massive batches of cranberry-orange relish he and my mother in law made each holiday for friends.  And -- much to his credit -- he always appreciated a nice meal and let you know it (even when it was just so-so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your dedication nicely put into words what I think often:  &quot;We know we are shining, even though we cannot see each other.&quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweet, super, super, sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great book!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I traveled to France and Italy this last summer and I took your book. I loved it and couldn&#039;t believe how much I connected to it...the food, the cooking, Paris as a savior and a lover, the words, and the beautiful moments of a family in real life. I just wanted to say that I so appreciated your hard work and your heartfelt outpouring of your life&#039;s story; it is a great picture. And, I loved adding sticky notes to the recipes that someday soon I will delve in to. Oh, and I even used a line from you as advice to my partner about buying a house together! ha ha Merci beaucoup]]></description>
