					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://orangette.net/2011/02/by-popular-demand/#comment-25155&quot;&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;.

Definitely!!! That&#039;s how I first tried a very similar drink called The Italian Greyhound. The bartender smoked the chilled glass with rosemary (!) then built the drink that they make with vodka not gin (I&#039;m not really a vodka drinker, btw), strained it into the glass and topped with club soda. After I took a delightful sip and complimented her creation, she admitted she likes it even more topped with Prosecco, so I said let&#039;s do that. Wow it was amazing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aperol is my new love, particularly a spritz with lots of club soda. I do not love, however, the red and yellow dyes that are used.  I&#039;ve been trying to find a recipe so that I can make it myself, knowing that I won&#039;t mind one bit if it&#039;s not bright orange!  Any ideas how to find something close?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly and readers,
I have a MUCH belated recommendation for an Aperol drink.  It was made by the bartender at Bar Avignon in Portland, OR.
The cocktail is called a &quot;Pinky Swears.&quot;  I looked it up online and it doesn&#039;t typically include tequila.

     Pinky Swears (Bar Avignon) ;
            1/2 oz. Aperol
            1/2 oz. St. Germaine
            1 oz. grapefruit juice
            1.5 oz tequila

Pour into a shaker, filled with ice.
Shake.  Strain into a coupe glass (like the one in the Pampelmousse photo).  Serve.

Sorry that I can&#039;t give specific credit to the bartender.  Forgot to ask his name  :-(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Aperol Spritzer was a pleasant surprise for me as well. I absolutely love Marlow and Sons! I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever had a bad dish there, or at Diner--the place next door that they initially started to handle the customer overflow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Marlow and Daughters, which is their traditional butcher shop right around the block, is one of the only two places i depend on for great meat. With the other being, the Meat Hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;ve just started my own fledgling blog about my obsession with food. And I&#039;d love some constructive criticism: http://forkinaround.wordpress.com/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read this post when you first posted it, looked for Aperol once in the liquor store near my apartment in France, then gave up. But, I am traveling in Italy, and one of the first things I saw in Milan was Aperol on the menus! I&#039;ve had two so far--one there, in a giant tumbler glass with far too many finger foods for one girl, for 8 euros. And another teeny one in a plastic cup in Venice on the last day of Carnival, as I walked back to my hostel from the celebrations. What an easy thing to love. Thank you for alerting my attention to it! The memory of your post has traveled far and wide!]]></description>
