					<description><![CDATA[Just baked this in San Francisco for several French friends-- totally delicious! Of course there was discussion about the similarities to Tarte Tatin...I love how there are no super shmancy ingredients -- just the good ole baking basics used in a slightly new way.  Merci beaucoup]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love the crumble, but I was just wondering... Why would you throw away the coffee cake? Baking powder doesn&#039;t really go &quot;bad&quot;, it just can become less active because of accumulated moist, but there&#039;s nothing there that can become poisonous, so unless the cake did not rise at all, there was really no good reason to throw it away... Just saying :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love all things by Mr. Slater and got very excited about this recipe as soon as you posted it. Today I got around to making it and was thoroughly pleased - as were the friends I fed it to. Thanks so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I feasted at Delancey last Sunday and oooooh that pate was delicious! And I&#039;m so sad I missed out on Rachel&#039;s delicious ginger beer my last few times too b/c I finally tried it (per a friend&#039;s enthusiastic recommendation earlier in the week)! And then, of course, as always the White Pie was damn good. I could keep going and cover our whole menu...but, instead: Thank you! Thank you to Brandon and you and the fantastic Delancey crew!]]></description>
