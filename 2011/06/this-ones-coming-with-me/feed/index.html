					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m more of a lurker than a commenter, but I kind of just wanted to tell you that this is the best shortcake recipe, hands down. I&#039;ve made it at least a dozen times since I found it last strawberry season, and a couple of Sundays ago I made it for the first time this season. They&#039;re in the oven again right now, and I can&#039;t wait. I have a flat of strawberries we picked this morning, and I plan on spending at least a third of them on shortcake. Thanks. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just found this wonderful recipe and tried it last night. We are past prime strawberry season here (WI)but I got some great peaches at the market and decided to try grilling them. I cut them up and macerated them with some Grand Marnier and sugar and put them over these shortcakes.  A little cream whipped with some Grand Marnier was the finishing touch, Yum! I have to admit, I changed up the recipe a bit and made it into more of a scone with some cinnamon sugar on top, sorry Dorie! This is going into my permanent file.]]></description>
