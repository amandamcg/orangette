					<description><![CDATA[Amazing recipe. I have never made Deviled Eggs any other way than the &quot;usual&quot;, these were wonderful! I probably used less of the yolk filling, because of the addition of the basil aioli.. I am a bit weird about texture, it worked very well. Didn&#039;t fry the capers (got lazy) but drained and dried them off enough to not add any more moisture. Used more basil than I should have.. Didn&#039;t measure correctly.. But it didn&#039;t hurt. Hah!! This recipe is so wonderful because it doesn&#039;t HAVE to be exact. It&#039;s not the portions that make the egg, it&#039;s the initial idea to mix these flavors together! Thank you so much for posting!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had some issues with the hard boiled eggs..figured out that adding salt to the water, and using eggs a week or two old, yields the best peeling experience, had to make them twice, oopsy! :-P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the photo, if the link doesn&#039;t work, just copy and paste to your search bar ... www.instagr.am/p/drhKl &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Deanna J Baker]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love all the comments and tips!  I use a sieve to press the yolks through- it makes the yolk mixture, when done, perfectly smooth like think whipped cream for a pretty presentation.  I have also boiled chopped beets in vinegared water and soaked the peeled hard boiled eggs for a few hours- up to overnight covered in the pink beet juice.  When you slice them open, the beet juice stains the egg whites, and depending on how long you soak them- it creeps into the whites.  It just takes a little planning ahead, and the outcome is gorgeous, and it does not affect the flavor of the egg whites.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read most of the posts, and didn&#039;t notice anyone suggesting THIS METHOD OF PEELING EGGS, so thought I&#039;d share.  I&#039;m NOT patient enough, and too picky, to appreciate the pock-marked typical outcome of egg peeling.  I happened upon this method a while back, and am IN LOOVE!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. After chilling the eggs enough to handle, tap them lightly, just enough to crack the shell.  &lt;br /&gt;2. Crack the shell around the entire egg, in the center - you should have one &quot;line&quot; of cracks around the thickest part of the egg.  &lt;br /&gt;3. Insert the tip of a spoon into the crack, so that the shape of the egg nestles into the bowl of the spoon.  &lt;br /&gt;4. Use the spoon to lift and remove the shell.  It - the shell - should come off in 2-4 pieces.  &lt;br /&gt;5. Voila!  A sleek quickly peeled egg, begging to be included in all sorts of fabulous dishes.]]></description>
