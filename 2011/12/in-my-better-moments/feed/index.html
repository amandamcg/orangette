					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I love your writing. If you weren&#039;t so honest and didn&#039;t talk about the struggles you sometimes have it wouldn&#039;t mean half as much to me. You know how sometimes you just can&#039;t help but be irked by people who are always so &#039;perfect&#039;, even though they are entirely nice and you&#039;re unjustified in being irked? Well I&#039;m so glad I don&#039;t feel that way about you. I love that you can admit that sometimes your gems of writing don&#039;t come easy. Writing is a scary thing to do, especially when you&#039;re writing about yourself. I just blogged about my new year resolutions, that I almost failed on keeping already, due to my fear of writing and putting myself out there. I&#039;m hoping it&#039;ll make me stick to them more! Good luck with the book, you know all your fans will love it. x]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hope you find inspiration from somewhere Molly. I hope it grows like wildflowers. I just came across your book recently and I bought your book on Amazon last night (Kindle edition), stayed up til the wee hours reading it last night and finished it today. I imagine it is annoying that something that takes time to construct takes so kittle time to read, but if it is any consellation, my copy is filled with my virtual highlights and bookmarks and notes. Gutted that the Kindle edition doesn&#039;t include illustrations. It&#039;s not often a foodie book has drawings, I was looking forward to the visual treat. Is there anywhere I can view them online?Can&#039;t wait to read what else you have in store for us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As Anne Lamott says, it&#039;s okay to have shitty first drafts. In fact, they lead to great final edits. Can&#039;t wait for the new book!]]></description>
