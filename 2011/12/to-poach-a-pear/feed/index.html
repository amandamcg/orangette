					<description><![CDATA[I found your blog after searching Google for a recipe to poach pears but I have found so much more in your beautifully written blog. The pears were poached yesterday (I think the comment I left then is lost forever in the ether), and we have enjoyed them today. Despite my love of cooking and my advanced years I had never poached pears before -what a treat I&#039;ve been missing!&lt;br /&gt;I have a passion for cookery books, especially cookery books that are more than a bunch of recipes and I was delighted to see that you had written a book. Even more delighted to source a hb copy (here in the UK) which is now on its way to me.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow! I first want to comment on your photos’;  I truly enjoyed the pictures.  The poached pears look fantastic. This has given me an experimental idea.

					<description><![CDATA[Robyn, thank you!  And as for the pears, it should be fine to store them in their liquid for a day or two.  I left mine that way for a day, and the texture was still really lovely.]]></description>
