					<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed your Christmas eve story. So nice to get a chance to go crabbing when you live in an actual city!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older sister runs a printing studio on Guemes Island, which is one of the San Juans (it is a 5 minute ferry ride from Anacortes). People go crabbing there a lot, so much that she made a print/painting of crab pots. You should check it out, and the other sea-inspired stuff she makes too! Here is a link to that print: http://slowshirts.com/product/crab-pots-print&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as &quot;cleaning&quot; crab goes, it can be pretty brutal to &quot;put them down&quot; in a humane (not possible!) way. My dad has a crab guillotine we use when we&#039;re out in the San Juans. Puts an axe straight through the middle of the crab. It&#039;s horrifying - but he claims it&#039;s the &quot;nicest&quot; way to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just read your most recent post and now I need to find the granola ingredients here in Norway so I can make some of it myself! I am not lured in by store-made stuff since there really isn&#039;t any sold here! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for the great post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We live in Oregon and I have been wanting to try crabbing for quite some time - ironically, crab is a Christmas Eve tradition in our home too.  Maybe next year I can bring home the bacon (or crab).]]></description>
