              <p>Hi, friends.</p>
              <p>
                This is not the post I had expected to write next. In my head,
                there were going to be cheers, an obscene number of exclamation
                points, and maybe a picture of the evening street outside our
                apartment in Paris. But due to sad and unforeseen circumstances,
                our Paris Diary project has been postponed. I don&#8217;t know
                how I even managed to type that sentence, because I hardly
                believe what it says. Your support for this project blew me
                away, and I canâ€™t tell you how sad I am.
              </p>

                I was due to fly out of Seattle this past Wednesday, go to
                London to see my friend
                <a href="http://bferry.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Brian</a
                >, and then take the train down to Paris on Sunday. Because I
                had already paid for the plane ticket and cleared my schedule,
                and because I have forty rolls of film waiting to be used, I
                went ahead and boarded my flight. I arrived in London yesterday.
                Now I have to decide what to do next.

                There was an older woman sitting next to me on the flight, and
                we started talking when I helped her find the switch for her
                reading light. She never introduced herself, but I saw on her
                landing card that her name was Pauline. Pauline wore frosted
                taupe nail polish and had a snore like a lawnmower, though when
                she asked me if she&#8217;d snored, I assured her that I
                hadn&#8217;t heard a thing. Her parents were British
                missionaries, she told me, and she was born in Calcutta. She
                lived in Bangalore until she was seven, and then she lived in
                Australia, then in England, and then moved to the US in 1969.
                But she still has relatives in England, and she comes back to
                visit them every year.
                <span style="font-style: italic">You&#8217;re lucky</span>, she
                told me.
                <span style="font-style: italic"
                  >Traveling is so much easier now than it used to be!</span
                >
                Her mother died in India years ago, and with the way things
                worked then, Pauline couldn&#8217;t get there in time for the
                funeral. We were silent for a while. As we came down out of the
                clouds and flew toward London, she stared out the window, and
                then she turned to me and smiled.
                <span style="font-style: italic"
                  >I love the English countryside</span
                >, she said,
                <span style="font-style: italic"
                  >the way they divide up the fields with those pretty
                  hedges</span
                >.

                I found myself thinking about Pauline this morning, when I woke
                up too early from the jet lag. Maybe I&#8217;ll go see the
                English countryside, for her. I like that idea. Maybe I&#8217;ll
                go to Scotland, too. I&#8217;ve never been. Brandon went there
                as a teenager, and he&#8217;s always told me how beautiful it
                is. I have a couple of friends who live in Edinburgh, so I think
                I might take the train up. This may not be the trip I planned,
                but I&#8217;m going to make something of it. I&#8217;ve got my
                two favorite cameras, and wherever I go, I want to share this
                trip with you. I think that&#8217;ll make us both feel better.
              </p>
              <p>I&#8217;ll see you back here in a few days.</p>

                        I hope you can make the most of it and see some of
                        Europe anyway, since Seattle is a very long way away

                        Some tips, in case you need them: Ryanair and Easyjet
                        are cheap airlines that go between most European cities.
                        It might be cheaper to fly to Edinburgh than take the
                        train, be sure to check it out. I&#39;m sure your
                        Edinburgh friends are already helping you with this one.

                        If you can manage it, definitely get up to Edinburgh. If
                        you can manage even more, go to Stirling, St. Andrews,
                        or the West of Scotland (Oban, Mallaig, Fort William are
                        probably too far but if you rent a car, you&#39;ll have
                        a real treat driving through Argyll).

                        I&#39;m so sorry your Paris project had to be postponed.
                        I hope you can make the most of it and see some of
                        Europe anyway, since Seattle is a very long way away

                        Sorry to hear that your plans didn&#39;t work out, but

                        I agree with everything Lizzie says. It is a beautiful

                        and film to go enjoy it. I am stuck in the office at
                        Blackfriars and the people next to the window have put
                        the blind down as it is too sunny for their computers.

                        So sorry to hear about this Molly &#8211; but look on
                        the bright side. It&#39;s a sunny Friday morning in
                        London, a city which has so much to offer. Days of
                        exploring await even if you don&#39;t go anywhere else,
                        there&#39;s great food from all over the world and great
                        coffee too. Wander around, avoid the most turisty bits,
                        look for hidden corners and treasures.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For example&#8230; If walking by the river from Richmond
                        towards Hampton Court palace, you can get wonderful
                        chocolate in Richmond, visit Petersham Nurseries for a
                        quick bite (I think that&#39;s on Brian&#39;s to-do
                        list), pick a loaf of bread in a great German
                        bakery/deli along the way, grab some great cheese in
                        Teddington and while there &#8211; if time permits
                        &#8211; stop by in our little coffee roastery and say
                        hi, then continue through Bushy Park with its deer
                        towards the palace where Henry VIII lived once upon a
                        time for a bit of history&#8230; Or take the train and
                        see many of the wonderful towns and places.
                      </p>

                        Hi Molly &#8211; been a long-time reader but not
                        commented before&#8230;but your post made me take the
                        plunge! Sorry to hear your Paris project is postponed,
                        but I hope you can make the most of your time here in
                        the UK. Can I recommend a day trip to Oxford if time
                        permits? I spent 3 very happy years there as a student
                        and it&#39;s beautiful at this time of year. The ice
                        cream made at G&#038;Ds on Little Clarendon Street is to
                        die for. As a current Londoner though, I definitely
                        recommend spending some time pottering in our city
                        &#8211; one of my favourite places is the National
                        Portrait Gallery which is fascinating.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Hope you get to Paris soon (I also spent a year there as
                        a student, and it is my spiritual home!)

                        and adventures; imagine getting home full to the brim
                        with unsought and unplanned memories and being able to
                        say &#39;it wasn&#39;t the trip I expected but I loved
                        it anyway&#39;.<br />I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have all
                        sorts of people leaving comments here telling you of

                        Coast will be stunning, find a Landmark Trust property

                        for a while. I&#39;m sure whatever you end up doing will

                      <p>Hi Molly</p>
                      <p>
                        Sorry your trip to Paris was cancelled and I hope that
                        the reason for that does not overshadow the rest of your
                        trip. I&#39;ve been reading your blog for a while now,
                        and I&#39;ve never posted a comment, but I find myself
                        compelled to do so now that you are stranded in the UK!
                        I&#39;m not from England (Australia, actually) but have
                        lived here for ten years and must add my voice to those
                        suggesting Bath and Oxford for day trips &#8211; such
                        wonderful, wonderful cities, particularly at this time
                        of year. But while you&#39;re in London you must go to
                        Borough Market for the amazing food and atmosphere
                        &#8211; it would be criminal not to! Hope you enjoy your
                        time over here.
                      </p>

                      <p>Hi Molly</p>
                      <p>
                        Sorry your trip to Paris was cancelled and I hope that
                        the reason for that does not overshadow the rest of your
                        trip. I&#39;ve been reading your blog for a while now,
                        and I&#39;ve never posted a comment, but I find myself
                        compelled to do so now that you are stranded in the UK!
                        I&#39;m not from England (Australia, actually) but have
                        lived here for ten years and must add my voice to those
                        suggesting Bath and Oxford for day trips &#8211; such
                        wonderful, wonderful cities, particularly at this time
                        of year. But while you&#39;re in London you must go to
                        Borough Market for the amazing food and atmosphere
                        &#8211; it would be criminal not to! Hope you enjoy your
                        time over here.
                      </p>

                        Paris IS beautiful, but so is England/Scotland!
                        Edinburgh was absolutely beautiful [you should do the
                        scotch tasting up near the castle ðŸ™‚ and climbing
                        Arthur&#39;s Seat is a must], and I loved hiking through
                        the Yorkshire Dales and the Hill Country.

                        If you get a chance Bath is an amazing city with
                        excellent architecture [can you guess my major in
                        college yet!?], and Fountains Abbey/Studley Royal is a
                        perfect example of: a Jacobean mansion, a Victorian
                        Church, abbey ruins, and the juxtaposition of a romantic

                        If you want countryside and fields with hedges and
                        drystone walls then you want to visit Cumbria and the
                        Lake District. (Although my home county of Lancashire is
                        pretty darn good too). Sit on the left hand side of the
                        train leaving London for Edinburgh and shortly after you
                        pass through Lancaster Station you will get to Cumbria.
                        Then by the time you reach Carlisle you will be
                        practically in Scotland.

                        not because of the slight regret in the undertones of
                        the story. it&#39;s beautiful to hear someone who&#39;s
                        lived a long part of their life share their experiences,
                        their input on traveling, their observations on things
                        that have changed, etc. it&#39;s beautiful what time and
                        travel can do to a person. i want to sit with pauline

                        You are a brave lady, and yes, lucky. Some thoughts: the
                        train to Edinburgh from London is *long* but mostly
                        stunning, especially as you get closer to the border
                        country. There is a wonderful overnight train that is
                        lovely, though, and there&#39;s nothing quite like
                        pulling into the Edinburgh station (you&#39;ll see why)
                        very early in the morning. I do love Auld Reekie. A word
                        to the wise: if you DO take the train, don&#39;t make
                        the assumption that trains emanating from north of
                        London won&#39;t go south, back to London, before they
                        go on to Edinburgh. I learned this when I was at
                        Cambridge (which, by the way, you might want to visit).
                        <br />All will be well; I can&#39;t wait to see what you
                        shoot.

                        You are a brave lady, and yes, lucky. Some thoughts: the
                        train to Edinburgh from London is *long* but mostly
                        stunning, especially as you get closer to the border
                        country. There is a wonderful overnight train that is
                        lovely, though, and there&#39;s nothing quite like
                        pulling into the Edinburgh station (you&#39;ll see why)
                        very early in the morning. I do love Auld Reekie. A word
                        to the wise: if you DO take the train, don&#39;t make
                        the assumption that trains emanating from north of
                        London won&#39;t go south, back to London, before they
                        go on to Edinburgh. I learned this when I was at
                        Cambridge (which, by the way, you might want to visit).
                        <br />All will be well; I can&#39;t wait to see what you
                        shoot.

                        being postponed. I hope your unexpected time in the U.K.
                        is wonderful. Definitely go to Edinburgh! We lived in
                        Scotland for a while including 4 years in Edinburgh, and
                        I&#39;m certain you and your cameras will love it! The
                        train is expensive but such a lovely journey. And if you
                        can, keep heading north to Fife &#8212; there are such
                        beautiful fishing villages (Crail, Pittenweem,

                        Molly, if you want to see a nice countryside have a look
                        at the Cotswolds around Bath. Or alternatively, on your
                        way up to Scotland, have a stop around Bradford/Leeds.
                        The Bronte sisters grew up in Haworth which I
                        experienced as a lovely place to experience the
                        Yorkshire countryside. Similarly, have a look at
                        Saltaire (around Bradford as well), which is an old
                        textile industry town, with the Salt Mills that are now
                        a museum to David Hockney (who is from around there).
                        Just a few suggestions. I am positive you are going to
                        have a great time in the UK. Sometimes the best things
                        come out of unexpected changes in plans.

                        Molly, I know this sounds crazy, but maybe I can find
                        you a place to stay in Venice, where I am from. Shoot me
                        an e-mail if it something you would consider. I met you
                        years back when you were presenting your book at the
                        Omnivore bookstore, and I know you are a nice and kind
                        person I can trust ;o)

                        I loved Scotland, and Ireland as well. If you decide to
                        stay in GB, I highly recommend a trip to the Aran
                        Islands, magical!

                        about Pauline. Scotland sounds like a great idea, and 40
                        (!!!!) rolls of film! I hope a Hasselblad is involved,
                        too.

                        I&#39;m sorry to hear that, Molly, but I loved hearing
                        about Pauline. Scotland sounds like a great idea, and 40
                        (!!!!) rolls of film! I hope a Hasselblad is involved,
                        too.

                        Definitely eat at Bea&#39;s Bakery in Holburn and sample
                        vegetarian fare at Food For Thought in Covent Garden.
                        Nuzzle around the high street in Islington (the markets
                        are fantastic!).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Then yes! Get yourself on a train and enjoy the country
                        north of London&#8211; Especially Glasgow and Edinburgh,
                        and i *highly* recommend taking the ferry from Glasgow
                        out to the Isle of Arran&#8211; the most unique
                        geographical place on earth! Your camera will flip out!

                        Disappointment is so difficult, but often with setbacks
                        or changes of plans, come the best opportunities for
                        real adventure. And the best part is that because your
                        expectations have been exploded everything is a bonus.
                        Do enjoy. I know you will.

                        Definitely eat at Bea&#39;s Bakery in Holburn and sample
                        vegetarian fare at Food For Thought in Covent Garden.
                        Nuzzle around the high street in Islington (the markets
                        are fantastic!).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Then yes! Get yourself on a train and enjoy the country
                        north of London&#8211; Especially Glasgow and Edinburgh,
                        and i *highly* recommend taking the ferry from Glasgow
                        out to the Isle of Arran&#8211; the most unique
                        geographical place on earth! Your camera will flip out!
                      </p>

                        Disappointment is so difficult, but often with setbacks
                        or changes of plans, come the best opportunities for
                        real adventure. And the best part is that because your
                        expectations have been exploded everything is a bonus.
                        Do enjoy. I know you will.

                        Your posts make me feel a combination of admiration and
                        maternal nurturing. I admire the way you&#39;ve managed
                        to take all the things you love and weave them into a
                        warm, creative life. I&#39;ve drawn inspiration from
                        that and from how you use food and friends as a lens for
                        viewing the world. Seeing your disappointment on this
                        page makes me want to serve you a warm comforting bowl
                        of soup (hmmm, which kind?). Remember you can have it
                        all, just not all at the same time. Adventures await you
                        in the UK. You&#39;ll be richer emotionally as a result
                        of those adventures as well as the loneliness and
                        disappointment. Revel in it all and keep us posted.

                        So much to do in London..go to the National Portrait
                        Gallery and eat in the Portrait Cafe on the top with not
                        only the best view of roof top London, but great English
                        food with all those lovely puddings. Try to get their
                        recipe for Rhubarb Eaton Mess. Go to Persephone Books on
                        Lambs Conduit Street (persephonebooks.co.uk) for their
                        unique shop, and their beautiful paperback editions of
                        books by forgotten Women authors of the late 19th and
                        early 20th centuries.<br />
                        Edinburgh is also a beautiful city..BEST TEA EVER
                        (shortbread to die for) in the Balmoral Hotel right next

                        I love London! You should stop by the South Kensington
                        tube station and have a savory crepe from Creme de la
                        Crepe. Then try the Apple Crumble crepe for dessert! Of
                        course, Borough Market is really a must for a food lover
                        too. Then, for writing inspiration, you could go look at
                        the original manuscripts in the British Library. I was
                        so awed by the collection there. I love Paris, but I
                        love London more. If you do go to Scotland, you might
                        think about driving up to the Isle of
                        Skye&#8230;it&#39;s incredible. The weather may not be
                        great right now, so maybe check on that first. Hope you
                        end up having a great trip despite the disappointment

                      <p>
                        I&#39;m sorry the Paris project has been postponed (but
                        isn&#39;t &#8220;postponed&#8221; a much nicer word than
                        &#8220;cancelled?&#8221;) but as a fellow Paris lover
                        (my father&#39;s ashes are in the Seine as well) there
                        is a LOT to love in the British countryside. I
                        honeymooned in Scotland &#8211; we just rented a car and
                        drove, and I remember stunning beauty and unique
                        landscapes. Edinburgh is a magical city, but head into
                        the highlands &#8212; Dornoch, Inverness, Speyside. See
                        Birnam Wood and Cawdor castle. Go over the sea to Skye.
                        Or do England. The Cotswolds are breathtaking &#8211;
                        visit the town of Burford, ramble on the public paths.
                        Head into the West &#8211; see Glastonbury, and Bath. Or
                        visit the places I&#39;ve always wanted to&#8212; the
                        Peaks District (Chatsworth House is supposed to be a
                        model for Mr. Darcy&#39;s Pemberley), Devonshire (Sense
                        and Sensibility and Clotted Cream!), the Lakes District
                        (the Hundred Acre wood!) It&#39;s so easy to stay in
                        cities as visiting Americans, but outside of the city is
                        where I think you get a real feel for a place.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But before you leave London, do yourself a favor and eat
                        at the Harwood Arms in Fulham. The best restaurant meal
                        I&#39;ve had in a while.

                        Hi Molly- am so sorry to hear that your adventure has
                        been postponed. London itself can be pretty fabulous.
                        Come to Borough markets tomorrow morning (I&#39;ll be
                        there, doing my weekly shop&#8230;) There&#39;s a
                        chocolate festival on just next to it as well. Or, if
                        you fancy a trip on the train, head to Cambridge. The
                        editor of Fire and Knives has just opened Fitzbillies,
                        which has reinvigorated the classic chelsea bun. Could
                        be right up your alley.

                        Come to Borough markets tomorrow morning (I&#39;ll be
                        there, doing my weekly shop&#8230;) There&#39;s a
                        chocolate festival on just next to it as well. Or, if
                        you fancy a trip on the train, head to Cambridge. The
                        editor of Fire and Knives has just opened Fitzbillies,
                        which has reinvigorated the classic chelsea bun. Could
                        be right up your alley.
                      </p>

                        For moody and beautiful countryside go to Haworth in
                        Yorkshire &#8211; where the Brontes lived (and died).
                        Lovely little Bronte museum and you can wrap yourself in
                        a flowing cloak and walk on the moors. Perfect for an
                        October weekend with lots of photo ops.

                        I hope everything is alright, and I look forward to the
                        Paris Diary when it comes! Enjoy.

                      <p>Hello Molly,</p>
                      <p>
                        I&#39;ve read your beautiful book and followed your blog
                        for some time and tonight I&#39;m going home to make
                        banana sour cream cake for a friend&#39;s goodbye party.
                        And if you didn&#39;t think I was some kind of stalker
                        already, I&#39;ll compound the fact by saying
                        &#39;Welcome to my home town!&#39;
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        You will have a wonderful time. And no matter the
                        gloomiest predictions from climate change scientists,
                        Paris isn&#39;t going anywhere.
                      </p>
                      <p>Here are some suggestions:</p>
                      <p>
                        1) Go to Petersham Nurseries. I used to work there so
                        could eat for free (it&#39;s not cheap) but it would be
                        worth a trip nonetheless. Walk across the field from
                        Richmond station. This is the only view in London
                        protected by Parliament and you will see why.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        2) Buy an eccles cake from St John. This will change
                        your life.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        3) If Brian needs thanking for having you, and who
                        knows, you may decide to stay the month, take him to The
                        Anchor and Hope in Waterloo.
                      </p>
                      <p>Have a lovely SUNNY weekend,</p>
                      <p>Augusta</p>

                        The Cotswolds are beautiful this time of yearm and will
                        soothe your disappointment, I predict. You can also
                        check out Oxford. And there are many lovely gardens all
                        around that part of England. Perhaps Paris just needs a
                        little time to ripen. Meanwhile, if you want some very
                        fun books to read about Paris in the meantime, let me
                        know. Looking foward to your continuted posts.

                        I agree with Susan. All Things Happen for a Reason, and
                        there must be a reason for you to be in England instead
                        of France. Whoever said &#8220;When one door closes,
                        another one opens&#8221; knew exactly what they were
                        talking about, though sometimes you have to look around
                        a bit for the new door.

                        I was very much looking forward to your trip to Paris
                        (because I can&#39;t wait to re-live my own through you)
                        but it will be interesting to see how this little detour
                        comes out.

                        If you get a chance go to Scotland, the more north the

                        Oh do go to Scotland. I think that you&#39;ll find it is
                        a culinary feast. Edinburgh alone will delight. It is

                        clear your head like no other. Climb up to Arthur&#39;s
                        Seat for a spectacular view that will leave you
                        gobsmacked, get some Indian take-away at Kebab Mehal
                        where to students from the Univ. of Edinburgh go a
                        Nicholson Square, tea and chocolates at Plaisir de
                        Chocolat on the Royal Mile, cocktails with a view at
                        Harvey Nichols, enjoy wonderful and world-class seafood
                        at Martin Wishart (Michelin stars here) in Leith which
                        is where Edinburgh meets the sea. Endless food
                        opportunities. Not to mention the fish mongers, cheese
                        mongers, butchers, ciders, beers, and wonderful local
                        produce sold to make your own food. Yes, sorry, but I
                        love Edinburgh, probably as much as Paris.

                        mongers, butchers, ciders, beers, and wonderful local
                        produce sold to make your own food. Yes, sorry, but I
                        love Edinburgh, probably as much as Paris.

                        I am so sorry! Hopefully a fabulous adventure forms out

                        I am sorry your paris trip fell through but get to
                        Scotland if you can. Try and see a bit of each part of
                        the country &#8211; the highlands are completely
                        different from the lowlands and the west a different
                        vibe from the east. You will meet wonderful warm people
                        and if possible head to the Isle of Skye &#8211; so
                        beautiful. Also second the going to Edinburgh. Happy
                        journeys &#8211; can&#39;t wait to read about the
                        adventures you find. What did my mom always say &#8211;

                        there is a reason why things come out as they do. later
                        on you will have a perspective to see this. I think you

                        this weekend. We&#39;re picking olives and making olive
                        oil. I&#39;m expecting 25 people. You can help me cook!

                        Add me to the list of those sorry that the Paris trip is
                        on hold, and hoping that whatever the situation that
                        interfered is&#8230;well, you said it was sad, so I will
                        hope that those who need comfort and support right now
                        receive it in full.

                        Never having been to the UK, I don&#39;t have any
                        personal suggestions for how you might spend your time,
                        but if you are a fan of Patrick McGoohan&#39;s series
                        <i>The Prisoner</i>, maybe you could go to Wales to
                        visit Portmeirion, where the series was filmed. It
                        always struck as a beautiful place.

                      <p>

                      <p>
                        Add me to the list of those sorry that the Paris trip is
                        on hold, and hoping that whatever the situation that
                        interfered is&#8230;well, you said it was sad, so I will
                        hope that those who need comfort and support right now
                        receive it in full.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Never having been to the UK, I don&#39;t have any
                        personal suggestions for how you might spend your time,
                        but if you are a fan of Patrick McGoohan&#39;s series
                        <i>The Prisoner</i>, maybe you could go to Wales to
                        visit Portmeirion, where the series was filmed. It
                        always struck as a beautiful place.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Whatever you decide to do, have as wonderful a time as
                        possible.

                        Molly, if I may be so bold as to make a suggestion for
                        you&#8230;There&#39;s this French bakery in Stoke
                        Newington (right by Newington Green) called The Belle
                        Epoque. I know you are disappointed about not getting to
                        Paris (and having spent lots of time in both cities, I
                        understand why) but if you go to the Belle Epoque (which
                        is out of the way and not a place you&#39;d find as a
                        tourist) I promise you&#39;ll feel like you have a bit
                        of Paris right there in London. I don&#39;t usually do
                        this, but I&#39;m going to share the link to the post I
                        wrote about it simply because I want to show you *why* I
                        think it might help, especially for someone like you who
                        truly understands the necessity of French pastries:

                        Yes yes, go to Bath! It&#39;s the only place I&#39;ve
                        seen that comes close to capturing A Pattern Language
                        (and if you haven&#39;t read that book then you should).
                        Take long lovely walks all over town, but especially: by
                        the Crescents, along the canal to Bathampton, in the
                        Widcombe/Prior Park neighborhood, and along public paths
                        through the sheep pastures and allotments scattered
                        liberally around the hills above town.

                        so jealous! I&#39;ve always wanted to go to London.
                        Maybe you can find a fun food item to feature on Spilled
                        Milk. Get something that would horrify Matthew. That
                        would be fun. Take care!

                        I say hire a car if you can to drive to
                        Edinburgh&#8230;it&#39;s not that far really, and you
                        can explore some hidden gems as you travel north. When
                        you&#39;re about an hour south of Edinburgh, there&#39;s
                        a place called Bamburgh on the coast of Northumberland,
                        with a massive sandy beach and a huge castle coming out
                        of the rock. It&#39;s a gorgeous quiet place to walk and
                        write and think&#8230;so long as you remembered to pack
                        your woolly socks.

                      <p>Hi Molly,Â </p>
                      <p>
                        May I suggest a sojourn to Shoreditch? It is my current
                        favourite hangout place. As with most places in London,
                        it&#39;s got a curious mix of traditional and modern
                        Britain.Â 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I usually start with a visit to Geffrye museum, a
                        typical example of Brit&#39;s love affair with museums.
                        It is a 18th century almshouse turned into a museum. The
                        building itself is lovely to look at with a garden at
                        the back to wander about. Â The museum houses furnitures
                        and domestic items. But instead of displaying them in a
                        cabinet, they re-created a room from the house according
                        to the style of each period with genuine articles from
                        that period. And beautifully done as well!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        They also have a little darling of a cafe with glass
                        wall overlooking the garden. I recommend it highly. The
                        Geffrye museum is free like any museums in London.Â 
                      </p>
                      <p>

                      <p>Hi Molly,Â </p>
                      <p>
                        May I suggest a sojourn to Shoreditch? It is my current
                        favourite hangout place. As with most places in London,
                        it&#39;s got a curious mix of traditional and modern
                        Britain.Â 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I usually start with a visit to Geffrye museum, a
                        typical example of Brit&#39;s love affair with museums.
                        It is a 18th century almshouse turned into a museum. The
                        building itself is lovely to look at with a garden at
                        the back to wander about. Â The museum houses furnitures
                        and domestic items. But instead of displaying them in a
                        cabinet, they re-created a room from the house according
                        to the style of each period with genuine articles from
                        that period. And beautifully done as well!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        They also have a little darling of a cafe with glass
                        wall overlooking the garden. I recommend it highly. The
                        Geffrye museum is free like any museums in London.Â 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        After the visit, I would recommend Loong Kee, the first
                        Vietnamese restaurant as you walk away from the museum.
                        Pho is quite good. Steamed roll is specialty of the
                        shop.

                        I love and remember what a monk said once and he gave
                        examples&#8230;when something good happens it may not
                        always be good when something bad happens is it not
                        always bad. You made a good choice to still travel and
                        write about that. I hope the other project gets

                        I love and remember what a monk said once and he gave
                        examples&#8230;when something good happens it may not
                        always be good when something bad happens is it not
                        always bad. You made a good choice to still travel and
                        write about that. I hope the other project gets
                        accomplished soon too.

                      <p>
                        I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your trip being postponed
                        â€” but what a wonderful place to end up in the meantime!
                        I spent the last year living in the UK, and London is
                        absolutely one of my favorite places in the world.
                        It&#39;s a great food city, but such a wonderful place
                        to wander, as well. If you can swing a meal at Nopi,
                        Yotam Ottolenghi&#39;s new restaurant, or any of the St
                        John restaurants, do it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you do travel around the UK (which I highly
                        recommend), take the train. Flying can be cheaper, but
                        the train is absolutely wonderful, and the ride up to
                        Edinburgh is not too long (about 7 hours, I think).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Also, if you have time â€” I know this will seem sort of
                        out of the way â€” visit Ely cathedral. It&#39;s
                        absolutely stunning, and I think it&#39;s hands down my
                        favorite cathedral in Europe.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Enjoy your trip! I&#39;ve only been back in the US for
                        about a week, but I miss London already.

                        Go to Paris anyway. When I was there 2 years ago (right
                        at this time, as mentioned in comments for your last
                        post) I was heartbroken. The city was gloriously

                        that again: So alive! It&#39;s a good spot to be when
                        you&#39;re mournful; it will lift, inspire. You can

                        Hi Molly, Folks are right, things happen for a reason
                        and something magical will come of this unexpected
                        change, a gift perhaps. See if you can get to Hampstead
                        heath, or Golders Green or take a bus ride along
                        Holloway Road in North London. The ravens at the Tower
                        of London are truly amazing.

                        So sorry! But do go to Edinburgh. We went there this

                        a scone and clotted cream at Always Sunday. And a bagel
                        with fresh salmon at Elephant and Bagel. You get the

                        Hi Molly! I&#39;m sorry about Paris. However, I would
                        suggest that you get thee to Edinburgh. I worked on a
                        study abroad program in London this July &#8211; and
                        while it was lovely, especially the parks (Kite Hill at
                        Hampstead Heath is spectacular) and markets (Columbia
                        Road Flower Market!!) &#8211; I went to Edinburgh and
                        felt like I fell into a fairy tale. My friend and I were
                        punch-drunk in love with the place at first sight. We
                        took the train to Scotland from London&#39;s King&#39;s
                        Cross Station. It was around a 4 hour trip along the
                        English &#038; Scottish countrysides. Get a window seat
                        and take pictures. You&#39;ll see a lot of vast expanses
                        of green, tiny villages, and crashing seas. It&#39;s
                        just otherworldly. I do suggest booking in advance, as
                        it is considerably cheaper.

                        oh my dear. i am just so sorry. as i sit here and write
                        this, i&#39;m looking at your beautiful photo that hangs
                        on my wall (from sundays are for lovers) and thinking of
                        you on this now very (i do hope) wonderful adventure.
                        explore! take photos! i just read a lot about england,
                        scotland and ireland in all of the above comments
                        &#8211; but no talk of wales. i visited all of those
                        countries after i graduated from high school and fell
                        deeply in love with the welsh countryside. it&#39;s
                        simply lovely. if you do visit, pick up a copy of
                        &#8220;deep country&#8221; by neil ansell. it&#39;s
                        quite fitting for such a trip of exploration.

                      <p>
                        I&#39;m sitting here thinking, how very cool it is to
                        travel. I have been no farther east than Missouri and no
                        farther west than Hawaii. Those you who get travel to
                        faraway places are so blessed to be able to do that. I
                        just moved 250 miles, ok 232 I googled it, east of my
                        former residence of just about forever. I moved from the
                        cooler wet Willamette Valley to Hermiston, Or. Dryer and
                        in the winter much colder I hear. Oh and the summers are
                        triple digits most years. That move just about drove me
                        insane. I can&#39;t imagine flying to London or Paris!
                        How lucky you are. Actually now that I think about it, I
                        haven&#39;t been in a plane since the mid 90&#39;s.
                        Haven&#39;t had to endure all of the searches of body
                        and stuff. <br />Sorry that you didn&#39;t make it to
                        Paris, but London and the surrounding countryside so
                        wonderful.

                        One thing: on the outskirts of London there&#39;s a
                        bakery called Violet. I&#39;ve never been but I&#39;ve
                        had the biggest bakery crush on it ever. The baker is an
                        American (ex-chez gal) and it&#39;s supposed to be quite

                        has to offer and walk for miles and miles, just being
                        careful of the bikes that zoom at you from nowhere. You

                        HI Molly, <br />So sorry to hear about your change of
                        plans. You sound so disappointed, but I am glad you are
                        rallying around making the best of it. I am flying to
                        Paris on the 18th and will be there for a few days while
                        my husband attends a trade show. Having never been to
                        Paris before, I am excited to explore, especially the
                        restaurants! I have a little tiny blog and am looking
                        forward to writing about this trip. If you are at all
                        interested in exploring together for part of one day,
                        I&#39;d be thrilled. You can learn more about me via:

                        Hi Molly, sorry to hear your plans are postponed. Can I
                        also suggest Dorset / Devon/ Cornwall? Just beautiful.
                        The Tate at St Ives just for one. Also Sussex is so
                        pretty. And north Norfolk. Kettles Yard at Cambridge. So
                        many lovely places to go to!

                        oh, Molly, so many things i want to say. when i read the
                        post about the paris plans, i meant to post a comment
                        because i am head-over-heels, gob-smacked, pee-my-pants
                        in love with paris and whenever i hear of someone going,
                        i relive my favorite moments. i did an
                        uncharacteristicly bold thing (for me) and went there by
                        myself and rented an apartment there for a month. before
                        i left, a friend gave me a bit of advice&#8211;he said
                        &#8220;don&#39;t &#39;take the trip&#39;&#8230;let the
                        trip take YOU.&#8221; it was brilliant advice. in the
                        midst of whatever sadness you are in right now, it seems
                        you have surrendered yourself (in a good way) to that by
                        getting on that plane. and i believe that&#39;s when
                        magic happens.

                        one of my life lessons as been that when something has
                        happened that was big, fat, hairy bad news at the
                        moment, it brought about something that was so profound
                        that i never could have imagined or conjured up. I guess
                        it&#39;s about faith.

                        Hi Molly&#8211;<br />I&#39;m so sorry to hear that your
                        trip was postponed. I would definitely go to Edinburgh.
                        On the way, read 44 Scotland Street, by Alexander McCall
                        Smith&#8211;it&#39;s a wonderful series of vignettes
                        about Edinburgh&#8211;really a love letter to the
                        city&#8211;with a highly entertaining cast of
                        characters. I also recommend Dingle, Ireland. It&#39;s
                        lovely, as is whole area in the Ring of Kerry.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Enjoy your lemonade! It&#39;s cold and cloudy in Seattle
                        today.

                      <p>
                        Hi Molly&#8211;<br />I&#39;m so sorry to hear that your
                        trip was postponed. I would definitely go to Edinburgh.
                        On the way, read 44 Scotland Street, by Alexander McCall
                        Smith&#8211;it&#39;s a wonderful series of vignettes
                        about Edinburgh&#8211;really a love letter to the
                        city&#8211;with a highly entertaining cast of
                        characters. I also recommend Dingle, Ireland. It&#39;s
                        lovely, as is whole area in the Ring of Kerry.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Enjoy your lemonade! It&#39;s cold and cloudy in Seattle
                        today.

                        You have the right attitude to have a magical time
                        anywhere, and the eyes to see wonderful visions to
                        record with your camera. <br />If you go into a bakery
                        in Edinburgh, get a flapjack. It&#39;s not what you
                        think&#8230;and vegetarian haggis are nice. And the Isle
                        of Skye, sigh. So lovely, and the best handknit
                        sweaters. Go forth and enjoy!

                        You have the right attitude to have a magical time
                        anywhere, and the eyes to see wonderful visions to
                        record with your camera. <br />If you go into a bakery
                        in Edinburgh, get a flapjack. It&#39;s not what you
                        think&#8230;and vegetarian haggis are nice. And the Isle
                        of Skye, sigh. So lovely, and the best handknit
                        sweaters. Go forth and enjoy!

                        Maybe the Project has been cancelled, but you can still
                        go to Paris. In my experience, it&#39;s best to follow
                        through on your plans, to the extent that you can.
                        Whatever has stopped the envisioned Project may have
                        been beyond your control, but hopping the train to the
                        Gare du Nord to create a new and different Project is
                        definitely within your capabilities &#8230;. GO for it

                        have you thought about going on to Paris by yourself? It
                        might turn into a better adventure than you ever
                        imagined.

                      <p>
                        I&#39;m so sorry your Paris story has taken this turn.
                        I&#39;ve been a blog stalker of yours for years and have
                        read your book and treasure your recipes. Thank you for
                        writing! Love the PNW so much and I visited last week
                        (where my girlfriend Katie made me your orange marmalade
                        cake). But I now live in London with my husband and one
                        year old. She and I would love to take you to our
                        favorite amazing Ottolenghi take-away and a picnic in
                        our neighborhood Hyde or Holland Park (we live between
                        the two, I think you would love Holland Park). Our
                        schedule is wide open all week, do email me if you are
                        up for a little tour or need a cup of tea in a regular
                        London flat.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        take care, i can also offer any advice, help, or free
                        wifi here if you need it.

                        place in Europe (Paris and Rome are tired for first).
                        Can&#39;t wait to read about all your adventures!

                        Hi Molly,<br />
                        Sorry your plans for Paris didn&#39;t work out! Hope you
                        enjoy your time in England and Scotland, or wherever you
                        decide to go! I would suggest going to Holland if you
                        can get there. You could go to Paris too.<br />
                        Take a lot of pictures! (I know you will) and enjoy your
                        time there! Ask some locals about what you shouldn&#39;t
                        miss! You are lucky! Can&#39;t wait to read your next
                        post. Hope you have a great adventure!

                        and it was delightful. I fell in love with the Lake
                        District, and would love to go back. Travel by train or
                        bus if you can, in England. Such beautiful countryside.
                        <br />I look forward to your photos!

                        Neal&#39;s Yard Dairy. Monmouth for coffee.
                        Liberty&#39;s department store. Yellow tail sashimi at
                        Dinings. Books for Cooks in Notting Hill. Spanish hot
                        chocolate at Garcia and Sons. The list is long but those
                        are a few.

                        minute of the different trip you now have at your
                        fingertips. I lived in London for 13 years (and miss it
                        like a limb &#8211; truly a fabulous place), so make the
                        most of that. I now live in Cambridge (how lucky am I?!)
                        &#8211; come for the day! 45 minutes on the train from
                        King&#39;s Cross and it&#39;s stunning and sooo
                        historic. Scotland is gorgeous, for sure, but what LOUSY

                        I am sorry to hear that Paris is postponed, but Scotland
                        is lovely and I am sure that you&#39;ll find it

                        Can&#39;t believe it no one has said it&#8230;ARBROATH
                        SMOKIES. Scotland is a delight wherever you
                        go&#8230;Edinburgh&#39;s castles, St. Andrew&#39;s with
                        the university and the auld course, the Spey Valley with
                        smoky single malts, the highlands covered in mist and
                        gorse, the Lowlands with Rabbie Burns singing in your
                        ear, Glasgow with its fabulous university and restored
                        red sandstones, the west coast with the smugglers&#39;
                        inlets, the islands full of dreams and myths, Culloden,
                        Loch Lomond, Loch Ness&#8230; So, so, SO MUCH TO SEE AND
                        DO.

                        Can&#39;t believe it no one has said it&#8230;ARBROATH
                        SMOKIES. Scotland is a delight wherever you
                        go&#8230;Edinburgh&#39;s castles, St. Andrew&#39;s with
                        the university and the auld course, the Spey Valley with
                        smoky single malts, the highlands covered in mist and
                        gorse, the Lowlands with Rabbie Burns singing in your
                        ear, Glasgow with its fabulous university and restored
                        red sandstones, the west coast with the smugglers&#39;
                        inlets, the islands full of dreams and myths, Culloden,
                        Loch Lomond, Loch Ness&#8230; So, so, SO MUCH TO SEE AND
                        DO.

                        already made your decision and gone on, but just know
                        that Scotland should definitely be on your bucket list.

                        You have so many lovely responses and ideas to mull
                        over. From my corner of london I can wholeheartedly
                        recommend a stay here. this may have been suggested
                        already, but take a wander along South Bank, from
                        Westminster bridge down past london bridge. It&#39;s the
                        loveliest walk in london. if you go on a friday or
                        saturday, head south (away from teh river) at Borough
                        Cathedral for a wonderful wonderful food market &#8211;
                        the best and most famous in London (if not england). And
                        if you get a chance, go to Vinoteca on St Johns street
                        in clerkenwell for the most wonderful food and wine. It
                        has a non-booking policy and only about 25 covers, so go
                        early (whether for lunch or dinner) Smithfields Market,
                        at the end of St Johns Road, is wonderful &#8211;
                        historic, foodie (it&#39;s London&#39;s meat market) and
                        vibrant. Ah, I&#39;m envious of you and your footloose

                        it&#39;s been a long time since I can remember being

                        I&#39;d suggest Glasgow. Not because the food is great
                        (though there&#39;s some good of that), not because
                        it&#39;s the loveliest of the Scottish cities (others
                        are right; Edinburgh is divine, and anything northerly
                        has the most ridiculous, gasp-inducing topography), but
                        because it&#39;s got a bit, just the faintest of
                        glimmers unless you&#39;re seeing it absolutely in the
                        right way, of magic that&#39;s nearly impossible to
                        explain. I think I&#39;d love to see the city again,
                        through your eyes &#8211; and I think your particular
                        gaze would be able to get that sidealong glance just
                        right enough for sparkling magic.

                        As others have mentioned, I&#39;m sorry, too, for the
                        loss that accompanies this change in plans. But I&#39;m
                        also completely jealous &#8211; it&#39;s been a long
                        time indeed since I&#39;ve had the sort of
                        adventure-capacity that you&#39;ve been granted. My feet
                        are wandering-itchy just thinking about it.

                        I would suggest Scotland as well, but Glasgow. It&#39;s
                        not the loveliest city (Edinburgh is, indeed,
                        breathtakingly lovely, and any roads northerly take you
                        through the most gasp-causing topography &#8211; much of
                        the country boasts a sort of raw beauty that Glasgow
                        can&#39;t really claim), nor could you get the most
                        delicious food there (though I&#39;m sure there&#39;s
                        still plenty of tasty places to discover), but
                        more&#8230; it&#39;s got this glint of magic, but
                        it&#39;s not at all obvious. Rather, it takes a
                        just-askance view, a being a bit-off-kilter, to see it
                        &#8211; and I think you, in these circumstances
                        especially, would be able to capture that. I&#39;d love
                        to relive that city (because oh, it&#39;s been too
                        long!) through your eyes, even just for a bit.

                        what you end up needing.

                        Molly, I&#39;ve never posted on your blog before but
                        this has prompted me to post. Your lens on the world is
                        such a great combination of laser-sharp yet mercifully
                        and alluringly skewed that I bet whatever you aim your
                        sights on right now will be worthwhile and magical. Just
                        go where your heart draws you and observe and enjoy.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I&#39;ve lived in both London and Paris and you
                        can&#39;t do wrong either way. So sorry for the abrupt
                        and disappointing change to the plan you were so
                        thrilled about. Bummer. I respect your privacy about
                        what happened but know your readers are interested to
                        hear the story and support you.

                        Molly, I&#39;ve never posted on your blog before but
                        this has prompted me to post. Your lens on the world is
                        such a great combination of laser-sharp yet mercifully
                        and alluringly skewed that I bet whatever you aim your
                        sights on right now will be worthwhile and magical. Just
                        go where your heart draws you and observe and enjoy.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I&#39;ve lived in both London and Paris and you
                        can&#39;t do wrong either way. So sorry for the abrupt
                        and disappointing change to the plan you were so
                        thrilled about. Bummer. I respect your privacy about
                        what happened but know your readers are interested to
                        hear the story and support you.

                        Hi Molly &#8211; am another &#39;never posted
                        before&#39; but you are in my home town unexpectedly!
                        There is tonnes of good food to enjoy in London and
                        amazing shops. I totally agree you must go to Petersham
                        Nurseries and Borough Market but also try and go to the
                        flower market at Columbia Road this Sunday if you&#39;re
                        still around, it&#39;s gorgeous spot (and then have
                        lunch at Brawn), if you&#39;re looking for a day out get
                        to whitstable and eat oysters on the coast (and there is
                        a famous pub there called the sportsman), or for rolling
                        hills and quaint villages go to upper/ lower slaughter
                        in the cotswolds&#8230; if you need ANY suggestions for
                        food/shops/otherwise just let us know! The website for
                        the Guardian and for Time Out London can be quite good,

                        Oh Molly I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;ve had to change your
                        plans so abruptly. I hope you enjoy this unexpected
                        opportunity to explore the UK. London is a fantastic
                        city, if you can bear to take a break from sampling all
                        the foodie delights it has to offer you should try and
                        take in a show. The Lion King is in the West End right
                        now, if ever there was anything to cheer up a lonely
                        traveller, that show is it. Or if that is not so much
                        your style then check out Les Miserables, its a
                        beautiful show. <br />If you do come north to visit
                        Scotland I would suggest you do it sooner rather than
                        later, its getting increasinly dark and cold up here and
                        it would be nice if you could enjoy it without getting
                        frostbite!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I think you are so brave for striking out on your own in
                        the face of forced alterations to your plans, I am full
                        of admiration for you.
