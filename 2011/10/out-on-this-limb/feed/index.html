I&#039;m so sorry to hear that! That&#039;s horrible. What brand of kosher salt did you use? And was the butter unsalted, or salted? I just ran into someone at our neighborhood playground today who was singing the praises of these cookies, and I&#039;m so sorry they didn&#039;t work out for you.]]></description>

I was so excited.. but mine turned out how you have described. Crumbly, light and definitely bit chewy.  And inedible with that amount of salt! They won&#039;t even stack well. They just crumble. I followed the recipe exactly. I was SO disappointed :( 
I made a DOUBLE batch of the batter to bring some to a dinner party and the rest to work for a colleague&#039;s b-day.  Ohh... 2 wasted jars of PB. And over 2/2 a kilo of butter! I have no idea what I&#039;m going to do with all the dough sitting in the fridge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I stumbled across this recipe this weekend. My husband loves peanut butter cookies, and I have spent the last twelve years trying to find the perfect peanut butter cookies. I thought I had found it about five years ago. That recipe has been replaced.  So, thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ola! I was craving these cookies for the longest time and i stumbled upon this cookie recipe !
I was then inspired to make a these vegan - since i do not eat eggs!
 I used avocadoes to replace the eggs and butter - i had everyone looking at me like i was crazy but they turned out amazing !!! Also since i am living in Brasil Pastry or cake flour doesn&#039;t seem to exist so i mixed 1/2c. of mandioca (root) flour with 1 1/2c. wheat flour instead )
Really lovly blog you have here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used sea salt once (Maldon) for a batch of these cookies. Some people commented about how salty it was. Probably was due to the large flakes of salt crystals. Crushing may not have helped because crushing Maldon sea salt results in a very fine, nearly powdery salt. If you use a measuring spoon equivalent instead of using a scale to weigh the resultant powder, you will end up adding in more salt due to the higher density of finer grains within the same volume of space.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anonymous, I&#039;m sorry for not replying sooner!  If you&#039;re still interested, yes, you can use sea salt instead. Salt is interchangeable by weight, so 12 grams of sea salt should be the same amount of salty-ness as 12 grams of kosher salt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these last night. They smelled great out of the oven. I put the batter in the fridge for 1¬Ω hours to let it firm up like &lt;a href=&quot;http://theviewfromgreatisland.com/2011/10/salted-peanut-butter-cookies-molly-wizenberg-20-of-gourmets-women-game-changers.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sue suggests on her blog&lt;/a&gt;. The baking only half-way flattened out the scoops of dough, rendering the cookies shaped like low-height domes, 2 to 2¬Ω inches in diameter. On the second tray, I had to push down the dough half-way after letting the scoops sit for 15 mins at room temperature before baking in order to achieve a more flattened cookie look. I don‚Äôt see how frozen balls of dough would come out looking like cookies. I used all-purpose flour, Santa Cruz Organic Peanut Butter and Straus Family Creamery unsalted butter. Could it be the hand-held mixer that caused this? I used the paired wire beater attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Eating Experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let everything cool down first. I was surprised at how light the cookie was. It was not hefty. It was not chewy, but delicate and soft. It was almost like eating large macarons, except less airy with delicate crumbs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to let you know that these cookies have become a regular treat for my household. I make them with more invert sugar so they come out a bit softer. I also use Hershey&#039;s milk chocolate for the sour milk taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have found them to make particularly good ice cream sandwiches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yrs--&lt;br /&gt;--Ben]]></description>
