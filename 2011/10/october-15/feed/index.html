					<description><![CDATA[I live in London but have never been to Arch 72 in Druid Street.  Inspired by these pictures and the fact that I am the proud owner of the Doughnut King of the World (11 year old Harry) we went last Saturday.  All I can say is Oh My God!  We will be back.  The Doughnut King awarded the custard doughnut 1 million out of 10.  Thanks for the tip.]]></description>
