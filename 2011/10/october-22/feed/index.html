					<description><![CDATA[I love your blog and always love your photos... and I am secretly (not anymore, I guess) thrilled that I was in Paris on the same day as you were.  I was saddened when I read your trip was cancelled, and then I came home and found that you had gone anyway, how wonderful!  Were you in the Jardin du Luxembourg on the 22nd?  If you were in the Luxembourg, around 3-6pm.. well, I shall be astounded; we were there too!  Glad you went, and especially glad that even though it wasn&#039;t what you had planned or imagined, that it was wonderful.]]></description>
