					<description><![CDATA[On several trips to England I took with my Mom, sister, and brother we took turns writing in our travel journal.  It&#039;s so fun to go back and read them now, &#039;specially since my Mom and sister have since left this world.  Wonderful memories, some hilarious, that might otherwise have been lost.  Have a lovely time!]]></description>
