					<description><![CDATA[Those are beautiful pictures. I have done portions of that hike on Salisbary Craig, I think it is called.

					<description><![CDATA[Oh loved these pictures! I lived in Edinburgh in July - August 2010 and walked in Holyrood Park often but only climbed to the summit once with my other half! We almost died, it is a deceivingly steep hike! Prepare yourself. Also, I loved it when we lived there - even though it was short. I would move back in a flash if I had a job. &lt;br /&gt;Meagan]]></description>
