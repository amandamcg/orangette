					<description><![CDATA[What a lovely post. My favorite church is the Duomo in Milan. It&#039;s the most majestic thing I have ever seen.  I had gone to the roof and found these carvings of birds, flowers and fruit in such great detail on the marble. That church was just so beautiful  inside and out, and with such solemnity, like a grand old lady watching over the city.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow.  I stumbled here from the soggy bread post *I have never had it but it sounds yummo, btw*... and find myself transported into the past and inspired to dig out the albums and diaries from a European trip with my folks. Healthy and in their 90&#039;s, the evil-that-is-dementia has robbed them of so many memories. I&#039;m sure this is just the ticket to spend a lovely afternoon!  We attended Mass in a different amazing church every Sunday during our 7 month  journey through 11 countries via  VW camper in the early 70&#039;s.  Wonderful post and pictures! Thank you for sharing, I look forward more!]]></description>
