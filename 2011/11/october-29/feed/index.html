					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just read your lovely memoir and came by Orangette to see what&#039;s new. I am &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; glad you went to Edinburgh and loved it. It was to me what Paris was for you--I spent 2 years there as a student, met my husband there and still think of it as my second home.  The view from Arthur&#039;s Seat is one of my favorites in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chutney on sandwiches is great! Very few cheese sandwiches can&#039;t be improved by adding it.]]></description>
