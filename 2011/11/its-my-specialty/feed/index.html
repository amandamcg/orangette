					<description><![CDATA[I found this recipe years ago and have made this soup many times, customizing the recipe based on what I have to use up. I have used different greens, or substituted a turnip for the other root vegetables.  I generally use vegetable stock, but have probably also used my turkey stock leftover from the Thanksgiving turkey. So grateful that it is still available here on this site.  It is wonderful to have in the fall or winter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Incredible soup. Simple, easy. Classic and refined but also down-to-earth, healthy, hearty, and quite easy. I doubled the vegetable amounts to make a heavier soup since it&#039;s below zero here! I used a homemade pheasant stock which was killer. I&#039;m a chef and can say....great soup! Thanks for posting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this last year and it was phenomenal. Definitely greater than the sum of its parts. I enjoyed it with a poached egg on top as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone tried this with regular green cabbage?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We add barley to every soup recipe. Sometimes we just throw a bunch of barley in the slow cooker and have it on hand for a spoon full or two. Total comfort food for those who are looking for a healthier snack!]]></description>
