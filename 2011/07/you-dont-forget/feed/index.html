					<description><![CDATA[That looks fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I laughed when I read about you &#039;liking your toast with butter and your scones with themselves&#039; I feel exactly the same so have the same jam eating/making problem. I solve this by making the occasional jam tart. Fabulous warm with cream or ice-cream! Haven&#039;t tried these recipes but felt as you had been so generous with your recipe I should at least include a couple of links. :)&lt;br /&gt;http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2008/07/jam-tart/&lt;br /&gt;http://greekfood.about.com/od/cakes/r/pasta_flora.htm]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I don&#039;t see why you could not can this recipe. You can BWB can fruit packed in light syrup. You can even pack berries in water, apparently. The one thing I would probably be sure is that the syrup is still juicy enough to cover everything, which it looks like it is. Here&#039;s another link to a site that is very food-safety oriented, and which has a recipe for canning strawberries at a rate of 1/2 cup sugar to 1 quart (4 cups) fruit: http://pickyourown.org/strawberries_canning.php. The only thing the conserve does is cook down the syrup to make it denser, which shouldn&#039;t change the acidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. I plan to try this recipe soon as strawberries are in season again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got some scandalously large blackberries at the farmers make this weekend and made this with orange zest and a 1/4 cup sugar to 1 cup of berries ratio.  It was not long for this world!  Thanks for another winning recipe!]]></description>
