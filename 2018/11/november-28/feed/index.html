					<description><![CDATA[Molly!  
It&#039;s 4 am where I live and I can&#039;t sleep.  Truth is I had the worst breakup a couple of months ago and obviously I&#039;m not done grieving over what used to be me , us.  A lost love. 
I noticed that whenever insomnia kicks in,  I find myself  here . I went all the way  back to your oldest posts and I&#039;m now somewhere in 2008 .  Please know that your stories  and comforting words are making a huge difference.  My heart feels better now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing your story and journey with us. I read The Fixed Stars in two days, late into the night, as I have never read any non-fiction before. Your voice, which I enjoyed reading for many years on Orangette, shone through in fierce, blazing glory. I wish you, and all your family, all the warmth, and joy, and forward momentum of life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I miss you! A woman asked in a local Facebook group today which Seattle bloggers we follow. The only blog I could think of that I could recommend with enthusiasm is this one. I wonder how she will feel when she realizes the most recent post was in 2018. Ah, well. It&#039;s all rather timeless, so I told her to just start at the beginning and read.

Your voice is still very much a part of my world. I often think about one night rather late when I found myself reading about buckwheat pancakes and ice cream. (I actually am not totally sure whether you wrote about the ice cream with the pancakes, if I was eating ice cream while reading it, or just craving it, but they are solidly joined in my mind.) I had never tried buckwheat pancakes, but you made me want them so badly. They are now a regular Sunday feature in our house. I make Delancy Meatloaf about once a month. I admit that I have taken great liberties with your recipe, but I think you would approve. Your dad&#039;s potato salad is a summer staple and reminds me of your sweet relationship with him and that there is no shame in liking what you like (I&#039;m talking about you, Hidden Valley ranch dressing).

I bought your new book from Secret Garden a couple of days ago and look forward to reading it. I hope that you&#039;ve enjoyed the process of bringing it into the world. Thank you for continuing to be a part of my world.

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I had forgotten, too. For that, please forgive me. I have been a terrible audience. I began reading you to fall in love with dinner, and have never felt the same way about chick peas. I still kind of check them out in the bean aisle. Now, our daughter is 19, completely all the way out, but struggling with the implications of that, and I am reading Jungian psychology on the middle passage. Youthful crushes are a long time ago for many of us, but I think I might just turn those chick peas into the lemon &#038; parmesan &#038; the good olive oil one more time.  It&#039;s a lot cheaper than a convertible, and more meaningful, too. Looking forward to August with great anticipation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly so happy to hear that you will be publishing a book in 2020!  I was happy to see this post from you. I do listen to your podcast Spilled Milk which I enjoy. Hope you will blog again some day :(    I have also enjoyed your photography— I think you should consider teaching a class or possibly publishing some of your photographs! (Another project to think about ).   Wishing you all good things !]]></description>
