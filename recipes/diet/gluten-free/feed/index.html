					<description><![CDATA[<p>On the night we got there, when we checked in, the lady at the front desk wrote out the wifi network and password on the corner of a pad of paper, ripped it free, and handed it to me. I slid it into my phone case, so that I wouldn&#8217;t lose it, and last week, three months later, I noticed it still wedged there. &#8220;How&#8217;s that Rancho Pescadero wifi working for you?&#8221; Brandon says, peering over my shoulder. &#8220;Little slow, from 2,000 miles away?&#8221; I roll my eyes, yank out the scrap of paper, and crumple it up. But when he looks away, I press it flat again and slip it back in. I first heard about Rancho Pescadero was from a couple of Delancey neighbors and longtime&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Split pea, the ugliest soup! The food whose appearance most closely approximates toxic waste water! The miraculous substance capable of making a home kitchen feel like a military chow hall! Capable of making a person who has never used the words &#8220;chow hall&#8221; in her entire life suddenly feel like Chow Hall is what she will call her vast, sweeping estate in the English countryside, when she somehow inherits a vast, sweeping estate in the English countryside! Split pea, a voyage for the mind! I have written before about split pea soup. It is apparently a January thing for me: I last wrote about it four years ago this month.  Until yesterday, in fact, I wasn&#8217;t going to write about this particular version,&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I first tasted quince the first time I had dinner with my first editor, an exceedingly kind, thoughtful woman of whom I nonetheless was terrified, because she was very New York Publishing World, and because she was my first editor. She had let me choose the restaurant, which only ratcheted up the stakes. I&#8217;m surprised that I don&#8217;t remember what I wore, because I surely would have labored over the decision with a degree of care most commonly seen among people handling live explosives. The evening went better than I had expected: she told a funny story about her cat and gracefully ignored my elaborate, enthusiastic mispronunciation of the white wine she&#8217;d ordered. And when we arrived at dessert, she opened the menu&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>A couple of years ago, late one winter morning, we were out running errands in the neighborhood, and we stopped into La Carta de Oaxaca, on Ballard Avenue, for an early lunch. June was still in a high chair and not yet fully proficient at chewing anything with crunch, so we ordered their sopa de pollo for her, a rich, brothy chicken soup served in a bowl big enough for mixing cake batter, with the meat still on the bone and big hunks of zucchini, carrot, and chayote. I shredded the meat onto a plate and chopped up the vegetables with the side of my spoon. She ate with her hands, the juices running fast down her forearms, which were then still&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s hard to start a post when I&#8217;m bored with the photograph(s) I have for it. The alternate title for this post is &#8220;A Life Fraught with Difficulty, by Molly Wizenberg.&#8221; But I am never bored with beans. I don&#8217;t remember how I first learned of Molly Stevens and her classic All About Braising: The Art of Uncomplicated Cooking, but if you&#8217;ve been around here for any length of time, you will know that it is a longtime favorite. I bought it shortly after it came out, sometime in 2004. I was in graduate school then, planning to become Michel Foucault, albeit with more hair, fewer turtlenecks, and a vastly inferior command of the French language. Like anyone who has tried to read&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I went through a period a few years ago when I couldn&#8217;t cook a pot of dried beans worth a damn. Every bean came out waterlogged and falling apart, like a rained-on newspaper, and on the rare occasion when every bean wasn&#8217;t waterlogged and falling apart, it was only because a few holdouts had a mouthfeel closer to gravel. I did everything I was supposed to do: I soaked them, brined them, cooked them without salt, cooked them with salt, cooked them at a simmer, cooked them so a bubble only rarely broke the surface. Every way, the window of time in which they were just right, tender but not yet reduced to mush, was narrow at best. Occasionally I hit it, but&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Two Mondays ago, the night before the moving truck was due to arrive at my mother&#8217;s new (Seattle!) house with everything she owns, Brandon suggested making a celebratory dinner. My mother, it was agreed, would choose the menu. After a moment&#8217;s hesitation, she requested steak and Caesar salad. We headed out for groceries. I&#8217;m not going to go into great depth about the steak. I don&#8217;t know. I feel bored just thinking about writing it. You know how to cook steak. Right? You don&#8217;t need me. If you don&#8217;t know how, or if you want to try another method, I can tell you that we use Renee Erickson&#8217;s instructions (for indoor cooking, not grilling) on page 195-196 of her dreamy&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I come to you today, June 13th, a fine summer’s day on which you probably have no desire to turn on the oven, to talk about roasted chicken. More specifically, I want to talk about Thomas Keller’s Favorite Simple Roast Chicken, which I prefer to call TK’s Hot Buttered Chicken. I have long been a devotee of the Zuni Cafe recipe for roasted chicken. I imagine many of you feel the same way. Zuni’s recipe, which Judy Rodgers wrote with a rare and reverential thoroughness &#8211; may she rest in peace, and may more cookbooks be written like hers &#8211; relies on three things: using a small-ish bird, salting it a day ahead, and cooking in a crackling hot oven,&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>One evening last week, my friend Sarah sent me a sudden text that said only, &#8220;Yotam Ottolenghi. Carrot and Mung Bean Salad from Plenty More. Just do it!&#8221; These kinds of vital communications are why humans need one another: so that we know what to eat next. I was skeptical about the mung beans: I know they’re used to great effect in many cuisines, I know, I know, but a certain aura of patchouli and tie dye hangs over them. Still, I was willing to reconsider. I took down my copy of Plenty More from the top of the refrigerator, where my favorite and most-used cookbooks live. (Hey: another time when I mentioned this fridge-top collection, one of you asked&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I believe everyone should know how to doctor a can of beans. I also believe that, having said this, I have become my father. I also believe I would do anything, anything, absolutely anything to get R. Kelly’s &#8220;I Believe I Can Fly,&#8221; which lodged itself in my head as I was typing those first two sentences, back out of my head again. Spread my wings and fly awaaaaaaaaaay I come from a family of bean doctors. The beans we ate most often were baked beans &#8211; Bush’s brand, I think &#8211; to which my dad added brown sugar and Worchestershire sauce. We ate them whenever my mom was out for the evening, usually with boiled hot dogs. It felt&#8230;</p>
