I am less pleased to report that I will be living at my desk for several weeks to come. But I\u2019m also sort of excited about it. After a year of feeling like I was mostly writing <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">around <\/span>the story, alternating between panic and elation and panic and elation and desperately needing a beer, I feel like I\u2019m finally <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">inside of<\/span> it. I can see the story differently in here, and I\u2019m finding a lot that I didn\u2019t know about: details, ideas, explanations, a number of stupid jokes (which will hopefully improve before publication). This, to me, is the best part of the job: the way that the act of writing often shows me, for the first time, what was there all along. I could say a lot more about that, but all I really should say is THANK YOU, UNIVERSE, FOR SAVING ME, and then get back to work.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/45466-crumblebars1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/45466-crumblebars1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1506\" height=\"1161\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You, however, can bake some rye crumble bars. The recipe for these comes from Kim Boyce\u2019s terrific <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Good-Grain-Baking-Whole-Grain-Flours\/dp\/1584798300\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\">Good to the Grain<\/a><\/span>, and I stumbled upon it last week, at the end of a good day, while looking for a way to use up some rye flour I had bought. I\u2019d bought the flour for a different recipe, a recipe that I wound up not liking, and I don\u2019t know how things go in your house, but in mine, rye flour will not disappear of its own accord. So I got out Kim Boyce\u2019s book, because <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2010\/11\/i-am-sold.html\" target=\"_blank\">it\u2019s yet to fail me<\/a>, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">boom<\/span>, the streak continues.<\/p>\n<p>This recipe might look a little daunting, time-wise, because it consists of three parts: the shortbread crust, the crumble topping, and, in between, the jam. I didn\u2019t have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen, so I took Boyce\u2019s advice and made mine over the course of a couple of days, as the moments presented themselves, and stashed the components in the fridge until I was ready to assemble the whole thing. Basically, you make a quick shortbread dough from a mixture of rye flour and all-purpose, and then you press that evenly into a pan. (I did a notably crappy job of this, because I was rushing to make a phone date with my mother, and my pressed-out dough wound up looking less like a pastry crust and more like a gently rolling sand dune. But it came out fine.) You bake the crust until it\u2019s firm, and then you spread jam &#8211; you <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">slather<\/span> jam, actually; you\u2019re using quite a lot &#8211; over the crust. Then you top the jam with a crumble made from oats, both flours, two types of sugar, and melted butter, and you slide the pan back into the oven.<\/p>\n<p>Judging by the ingredients, I knew that the bars would be tasty, but the result was even better than I could have expected. I tend to think of rye in the context of rye bread with caraway seeds, which have a strong, sour flavor; I forget how subtle and sweet the flour itself is. It\u2019s nutty, almost malty. I like rye bread, but rye crumble bars have nothing to do with it. Anything with a shortbread base and a crumble topping is bound to taste good, unless you fill the space in between with wood putty, but it\u2019s the sweet, toasty rye flour that makes this recipe, and the way the sweet, toasty rye flour tastes with butter. I filled my crumble bars with a homemade <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mirabelle_plum\" target=\"_blank\">mirabelle plum<\/a> jam that a friend sent us last spring, and while I doubt it gets any better than that, I\u2019m also eager to try a batch with apricot jam, or maybe strawberry. But there\u2019s work to do first.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Rye Crumble Bars with Jam<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\"> Adapted slightly from <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Good-Grain-Baking-Whole-Grain-Flours\/dp\/1584798300\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\">Good to the Grain<\/a><\/span>, by Kim Boyce<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2012-03-21T21:49:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/419?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>For this recipe, I used <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bobsredmill.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bob\u2019s Red Mill<\/a> dark rye flour. You can also buy light rye flour, in which some parts of the grain have been removed before milling, but Boyce suggests the dark type, which has a deeper, nuttier flavor, and I second her recommendation.<\/p>\n<p>As for jam, choose any one you like, but make sure that it has a good level of brightness and acidity. That\u2019ll help it hold up to the richness of the buttery crust. Also, if you come up a little short, don\u2019t worry. I only had 1 \u00bc cups, not 1 \u00bd cups, and it was no problem.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n              <h3>Shortbread crust:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            65 grams (\u00bd cup) dark rye flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            120 grams (1 cup) all-purpose flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            50 grams (1\/3 cup) dark brown sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd tsp. kosher salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            113 grams (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tsp. vanilla extract\r          <\/div>\n                      <h3>Crumble:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            100 grams (1 cup) rolled oats\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            32 grams (3 Tbsp.) dark brown sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            52 grams (\u00bc cup plus 2 Tbsp.) dark rye flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            30 grams (\u00bc cup) all-purpose flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            38 grams (3 Tbsp.) sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tsp. kosher salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            85 grams (6 Tbsp.) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly\r          <\/div>\n                      <h3>To assemble:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            350 ml (1 \u00bd cups) jam, preserves, or fruit butter          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Set a rack in the middle of the oven, and preheat to 275\u00b0F. Rub a 9-inch springform pan with butter, or grease with cooking spray.<\/p>\n<p>To make the shortbread crust, combine the flours, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, and whisk to mix well. Add the melted butter and vanilla extract, and stir until thoroughly combined. (I found the mixture a little dry at first, so I put my hand in and squeezed and massaged a bit to bring the dough together.) Using your hands, press the dough evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan. Put the pan in the freezer for 30 minutes, while you make the crumble. [Or, if you\u2019re doing this step ahead of time, wrap the pan in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge or freezer. If it\u2019s in the fridge, just remember to transfer it to the freezer for 30 minutes before baking.]<\/p>\n<p>To make the crumble, put all of the crumble ingredients except the melted butter into the bowl of a food processor, and pulse until the oats are partially ground, about 5 or 10 seconds. Pour the mixture into a bowl. Add the melted butter and stir with your hands, squeezing the mixture as you stir to create small crumbly bits. Set aside. [Or, if you\u2019re doing this step ahead of time, wrap the bowl in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge. Take it out about 30 minutes before using, and if needed, use a fork to break up any giant clumps that have hardened.]<\/p>\n<p>Bake the frozen shortbread until pale brown and firm when touched, about 50 to 55 minutes. Remove from the oven, and raise the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F.<\/p>\n<p>To assemble the bars, spread the jam over the shortbread crust, and then top with the crumble, evenly sprinkling it over the surface and squeezing bits of it together to create irregular nubs. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until golden brown on top, rotating the pan halfway through for even baking.<\/p>\n<p>When the pan is cool enough to handle but still warm, run a sharp knife around the edge of the pan to loosen any jam that may have stuck. Remove the ring. Completely (or mostly, anyway) cool the bars on the pan base before cutting into wedges.<\/p>\n<p>Note: These bars are best when eaten in fairly short order. After three days or so, the flavors taste less clear.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: Boyce says 10 wedges, but these bars are rich, so I\u2019d say more than that.
