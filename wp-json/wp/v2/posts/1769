As Rebecca tells it, she knew that she <em>had<\/em> to meet Jimmy when she noticed <strong>his apartment window \u201cdisplays\u201d <\/strong>from the parking lot: mannequin parts from a department store, or a Perrier towel hung on the wall and lit from beneath. Their first official meeting was rather auspicious\u2014Rebecca was wearing no pants, a story for another time\u2014and today Jimmy, Rebecca, and Rebecca\u2019s straight husband John all live in the same building here in Seattle, just seven floors apart. <strong>Jimmy is the baker; John is the cook; and Rebecca is the force of nature.<br \/><\/strong><br \/>\u201cMoll, you need two husbands,\u201d Rebecca said solemnly this morning, stirring a small iceberg into her tea; \u201cYou can\u2019t expect one person to be everything for you. I mean, <em>really<\/em>.\u201d Jimmy listened silently, a strategy he\u2019s wisely developed over the years. I nodded\u2014she\u2019s got a point\u2014but frankly, I was distracted by the action in the kitchen. After all, <strong>the method for making a Dutch baby is only slightly less awe-inspiring that that for making a regular human one.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On the stove were two small <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lodgemfg.com\/\">Lodge<\/a> cast-iron skillets, a <strong>hefty<\/strong> cube of butter in each.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Dutch%20baby%20skillet_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/02\/Dutch-baby-skillet_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Turning on the burners, Jimmy carefully melted the butter, brushing it up to coat the sides of the skillets, and then, working quickly and dexterously, he poured the batter\u2014akin to that for a pancake, but with more eggs and less flour\u2014into the melted butter.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Dutch%20baby%20pour_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/02\/Dutch-baby-pour_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>He slid the skillets into the oven, and within moments, the magic began, the pancake rising like <strong>a bowl-shaped souffl\u00e9<\/strong> out of its foaming, sizzling pool of butter.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Dutch%20baby%20medium%20in%20oven.1_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/02\/Dutch-baby-medium-in-oven.1_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>While the Dutch babies baked, Jimmy struggled unsuccessfully to keep Rebecca out of the bacon, and I, while copying down the recipe, made an exciting discovery: Jimmy had inadvertently <em>doubled<\/em> the quantity of butter called for\u2014a very fitting accident, given that he has a well-documented penchant for increasing the fat in everything he touches, recipes and otherwise. This morning\u2019s butter mishap meant that Rebecca and I\u2014Jimmy can\u2019t bear to eat before 11 am and thus would watch us enjoy his creations\u2014would be eating <strong>half a stick of butter each.<br \/><\/strong><br \/>But never mind the pithy details.

They were delicious, eggy and light, their sweet richness countered by the tartness of lemon. And the excess butter in the skillets meant that the babies didn\u2019t even need the usual finishing drizzle of clarified butter. Rebecca polished hers off in record time before returning to the bacon: <strong>one thing at a time, she advises, for maximum enjoyment<\/strong>. And I, being well-trained, left a very, very clean plate. After all, I&#8217;m determined to be invited back. I hear that shortbread waffles are next on the docket, and they apparently feature lots of butter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Jimmy\u2019s Dutch Baby Pancakes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jimmy likes to make his babies in two 6-inch cast-iron skillets, but you can also make this recipe in a single 10- or 11-inch one.<\/p>\n<p><em>For the pancakes:<\/em><br \/>4 Tbs unsalted butter (or, if you\u2019d prefer to try it as we did with today\u2019s happy butter accident, try using 6-8 tablespoons, and then do not add clarified butter when serving)<br \/>4 large eggs<br \/>\u00bd cup all-purpose flour<br \/>\u00bd cup half-and-half<\/p>\n<p><em>For the topping:<\/em><br \/>4 oz clarified butter (or, if you\u2019re not into clarifying, simple melted butter will do)<br \/>Juice of 1 lemon<br \/>Powdered sugar<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Divide the 4 Tbs butter between two 6-inch cast-iron skillets, and melt it over low heat.<\/p>\n<p>In a blender, whir together the eggs, flour, and half-and-half.<\/p>\n<p>Pour the batter into the skillets over the melted butter.
