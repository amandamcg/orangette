My pool game is almost as bad as my bowling, which is bad.

Keaton said I never cease to amaze her. She thinks I should ride a mechanical bull on my birthday. <strong>I think I should ride a real bull<\/strong>. In honor of Oklahoma and all those kids from other states who used to ask me if I rode a cow to school, which I didn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of barnyard animals, tomorrow is <strong>the long-awaited Knight family lamb roast extravaganza<\/strong> for sixty! Kate\u2019s friend Nicho has provided an organically-raised lamb from his family\u2019s farm, slaughtered just today, and it is likely being prepped in the Knights\u2019 garage as I type this. There are many meats to love, but lamb, I love none so much as thee.<\/p>\n<p>This afternoon I trekked out to the wooded Knight abode to help with the preparations. When no one answered the front door, I let myself in and walked through the house until I found the back door open and Bing, Todd, and Bing\u2019s friend Steve down by the water, gearing up the little sailboat for a jaunt out on Phantom Lake. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.margotknight.com\/margot.html\">Margot<\/a> whisked me away to the house, where she offered me the family selection of swimsuits and a story for each. After a few tries and much mumbling to myself, I wound up in <strong>a red string bikini top and a blindingly heinous pair of green and yellow flowered hot pants.<\/strong> I felt like one of the family. It was a gorgeous afternoon. I went out on the boat with Margot and Todd and didn\u2019t even hit my head on the boom.<\/p>\n<p>Early evening found me and Kate picking supple grape leaves for dolmas, while across the garden her father tended a bed of long-necked flowers, his boom box crooning Al Green.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Kate_in_the_grapevines_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/08\/Kate_in_the_grapevines_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Kate was nearly swallowed alive by the grapevines, but they yielded such lovely leaves.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Grape_Leaves_Close_Up_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/08\/Grape_Leaves_Close_Up_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>I stirred a heavy skillet of onions for the rice filling while Margot and Todd bustled, blanched, and chopped, and shortly thereafter I demonstrated my newly discovered and frighteningly impressive skill at rolling and folding dolmas. Kate set a pound of butter on the stove to melt and settled into a relaxed rhythm with her four pans of baklava. Steve and his girlfriend Amy busied themselves with a cheesecake to prop up the just-picked blackberries and raspberries from the garden.<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow will be delicious. For the lamb, I will say:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Northern Pike<br \/><\/strong>by James Wright, from <em>Above the River: The Complete Poems<\/p>\n<p><\/em>All right. Try this,<br \/>Then.
