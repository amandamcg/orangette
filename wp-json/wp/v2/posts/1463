It\u2019s finally happening.  The wedding is upon us, friends. Or rather, it will be, in just under seven weeks. Things are slowly picking up speed.  Plans are taking shape. We\u2019ve been <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/04\/man-plan-food-blog.html\">engaged<\/a> for over a year now, and this show is ready to hit the road.

I\u2019ve never felt like a real \u201cbridal\u201d type, to tell you the truth.  I\u2019m not the sort of girl who knows from the get-go what her wedding will look like and what she will wear.  I\u2019m not very girly, as these things go.  I love dresses and fashion and little details, but I don\u2019t like much fuss.  For as much as I love throwing a party, a wedding is a whole other animal.  A big animal, for one.  Like, 200-people-big.  It\u2019s not my usual dinner party for four.  It\u2019s fourteen months of planning so far, and we\u2019re still counting.<\/p>\n<p>Slowly but surely, week by week, we\u2019ve schemed and daydreamed, crafting a celebration that feels like us.  It hasn\u2019t always been pretty &#8211; the biggest fight in our collective history has been over <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">flowers<\/span>, of all things, and I mean <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">FLOWERS<\/span>, people<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> <\/span>&#8211; but we\u2019ve done it together.  We wanted this wedding to be about both of us, and it is.  We set a date.  We scouted sites.  We asked a lot of questions.   We found a park by the water with a gorgeous view, and we spent a night last summer sleeping in our car, in a parking lot by some railroad tracks, in order to be the first to reserve it.  [It\u2019s a long story, trust me, involving another bride who gave us quite a scare and had a kiddie pool filled with rose petals.]  This spring, I made <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/05\/safe-to-proceed.html\">a test run of our wedding cake<\/a>.  Brandon started brainstorming our wedding pickles.  And last week, when our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/531927837\/\">invitations<\/a> arrived from the <a href=\"http:\/\/seattletimes.nwsource.com\/html\/pacificnw10012006\/2003279550_pacificportrait01.html\">printer<\/a>, he cooked <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/534185433\/in\/photostream\/\">dinner<\/a> and poured wine while I folded and stuffed and addressed and stamped.  Then we sat on the couch, sealed envelopes with the kitchen sponge, and ate cinnamon-sugar banana bread until we thought we would bust.  I should mention, too, that the bread was still warm, and that there were chocolate chips involved.   I\u2019ve tried to do bridal my way, and so far, I really like it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4ee89-bananabread011-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4ee89-bananabread011-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5074994179308377266\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Now, I know, I know.  I can hear you.  The last thing this website needs, you say, is <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">another<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/04\/on-sharing-and-sugar-with-lot-of.html\">banana<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/10\/big-bad-banana.html\">baked<\/a>&#8211;<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/02\/i-really-really-shouldnt.html\">good<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/mussels-wine-and-excuse-to-eat-whipped.html\">recipe<\/a>.  But I have to ask you to humor me.  If I could, I would bake banana bread at least twice a week. I would probably sleep with a loaf under my pillow.  As it is, I have to practically sit on my hands to keep from doing so.   The banana bread recipe for my book is long since tested and ready, so I have no excuse for baking this stuff.   I\u2019m a disaster.  I know it.  You can roll your eyes at me all you want.  But I have to say, you won\u2019t bat an eyelash once you\u2019ve tasted this recipe.  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Ahem<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>I stumbled upon this particular banana specimen a while ago, when Kickpleat, keeper of the blog <a href=\"http:\/\/everybodylikessandwiches.blogspot.com\/2006\/02\/banana-fana-fo-fana.html\">Everybody Likes Sandwiches<\/a>, first posted it.  It\u2019s a bit curious, seeing as it has no butter or oil or obvious fat of any kind, but I didn\u2019t let that stop me, and I heartily suggest that you don\u2019t either.  It comes together in a snap &#8211; and in only one bowl, which means blessedly little clean-up &#8211; and it pays back, flavor-wise, in spades.  Moistened with mashed banana, freckled with chocolate, and topped with a sandy, crackled crust of cinnamon and sugar, it has an open, chewy crumb that sits closer to a true bread than it does to cake.  Unlike conventional banana breads, which are rich, dense, and tight-crumbed, this one has a lovely, light chew.  It feels almost healthy in comparison, so long as you agree that chocolate and sugar can be described as such.  In this house, we certainly think they can.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve adapted the recipe a bit since I first started making it, reducing the sugar and cinnamon a touch, but otherwise, I\u2019ve left it as Kickpleat intended.  I owe her quite a debt of gratitude.  Like a cinnamon-scented magic carpet of sorts, this bread sailed us easily through a long evening of envelope-sealing.  Then, the next day, it fueled me through a second afternoon of folding and stuffing and addressing and stamping.  Then, on Friday, a square of it accompanied me on a flight to San Francisco, where I was joined by four of my favorite ladies for a bachelorette weekend, a whirling 48 hours of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/541033759\/\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">frites<\/span><\/a>, steak on the grill, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cowgirlcreamery.com\/\">Cowgirl Creamery<\/a> cheese, <a href=\"http:\/\/biritecreamery.com\/\">Bi-Rite<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/540846096\/\">ice cream<\/a>, picnics in Dolores Park, \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/540846078\/\">Pin the Macho on the Man<\/a>,\u201d  and a command lip-synch performance by yours truly, wearing hot pink lipstick and powder bronzer in some shade of terra cotta, in my aunt Tina\u2019s dining room.  I\u2019m already planning another batch.<\/p>\n<p>Something tells me that July 29 will be here in no time, so long as the banana supply holds up.<\/p>\n<p><b>Banana Bread with Chocolate and Cinnamon Sugar<\/b><\/p>\n<p>This lovely stuff comes together in less than an hour, including baking time.  And unlike more conventional quick breads, which are best when allowed to cool fully before slicing, this one doesn\u2019t suffer when it\u2019s eaten warm. That makes it, in my book, a perfect last-minute dessert or afternoon treat.  It\u2019s a good one to have in the old repertoire.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and while we\u2019re here, let\u2019s talk about frozen bananas.  I always keep a stash of them in the freezer, and I highly recommend it.  I chuck them in there, peel and all, and when I want to use a few, I just pull them out, sit them in a bowl, and let them defrost at room temperature for a few hours.  It doesn\u2019t take long.  You can then use them in place of fresh ripe bananas in any baked good, and they\u2019re easier to mash, to boot.  The only bad thing is that they look pretty nasty.  Think wet, slippery, and slug-like, and don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.<\/p>\n<p>3 very ripe bananas (the size doesn\u2019t much matter; medium to large works)<br \/>2 large eggs<br \/>1 \u00bd cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>1 cup granulated sugar<br \/>1 tsp. baking soda<br \/>2 tsp. ground cinnamon<br \/>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract<br \/>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips<\/p>\n<p><i>For topping<\/i>:<br \/>2 Tbsp. granulated sugar<br \/>1\/8 tsp. ground cinnamon<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.  Butter or spray an 8-inch square pan.<\/p>\n<p>In a medium mixing bowl, mash the bananas well with a fork or potato masher.  Add the eggs, and stir well to combine.  Add the flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, and vanilla, and stir to mix.  Add \u00be cup of the chocolate chips, and stir briefly.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and set aside.<\/p>\n<p>In a small bowl, stir together the topping ingredients.  Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the batter in the pan, and top with the remaining \u00bc cup chocolate chips.<\/p>\n<p>Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.  Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.<\/p>\n<p><i>Note<\/i>: This bread, like many banana sweets, freezes beautifully.  Sometimes I even like to eat frozen, cut into thick, cold, chewy slices.  It\u2019s the perfect snack for a hot summer afternoon.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Goodness.
