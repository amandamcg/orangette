Heck, I would happily eat an <a href=\"http:\/\/app.mcdonalds.com\/bagamcmeal?process=item&amp;itemID=10005\">apple pie <\/a>from McDonald\u2019s \u2013 you know, the kind that comes in those cardboard sleeves? \u2013 if it came with<strong> a melty dollop of this salted caramel ice cream<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Ice_cream_close_text_again.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/11\/Ice_cream_close_text_again.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Like many great discoveries in my life, I owe this one to Brandon. Back in September 2005, less than five months after we met, he bought me an ice cream maker \u2013 or, more precisely, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Lello-4070-Gelato-Junior\/dp\/B00009365G\">Lello Junior<\/a> gelato machine \u2013 for my birthday. When it arrived at my apartment, the delivery driver parked it outside the front door of the building \u2013 all <em>35<\/em> unwieldy pounds of it \u2013 and I came down, unsuspecting, to carry it upstairs. I read the print on the side of the box and let rip a ladylike snort: I had never declared any desire for an ice cream maker, but on more than one occasion, Brandon had. So here it was, at my door in Seattle. It was quite clear whose present this really was. But I did what any love-struck, butterfat-hungry girl would do: I hauled it upstairs and heaved it into place on the kitchen counter. And when Brandon came for his next visit, he made no fewer than three ice creams and sorbets \u2013 two types, in fact, on his first day in town. In the year or so since, I too have become quite attached to our little Lello Junior. It has pretty lines and curves, not to mention that fancy internal compressor, and it purrs like a fat, white cat. And it made possible this lovely stuff, which I cannot urge upon you strongly enough.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Ice_cream_text_again.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/11\/Ice_cream_text_again.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Salted caramel has been all the rage in recent years, traveling from its humble origins in the north of France to pastry menus around the world. The presence of salt works a subtle magic on caramel, deepening and brightening its flavor, making it taste somehow more like itself. Here in Seattle, I\u2019m rather partial to local chocolatier <a href=\"http:\/\/www.franschocolates.com\/aboutus.asp\">Fran Bigelow<\/a>\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.franschocolates.com\/catalog\/product.asp?cid=8\">grey salt caramels<\/a>, dipped in dark chocolate and freckled with a few nubbly crystals. But my new favorite incarnation of the salt-and-caramel duo is this ice cream, from a recipe that recently ran in <em>The New York Times<\/em>. I have sampled my share of caramel ice creams over the years \u2013 whenever I see them on a menu, I can\u2019t resist; <strong>caramel churned with cream just sounds so <em>right<\/em><\/strong> \u2013 but no restaurant or ice cream parlor has ever really wowed me with their rendition. This one, however, did, and by god, it came from my own kitchen.<\/p>\n<p>It starts with a very dark caramel, which, when churned with milk, cream, egg yolks, and the fancy French salt <em>fleur de sel<\/em>, makes for a very sophisticated, subtly sweet flavor that rumbles slowly around the mouth. And despite its rich ingredients, it doesn\u2019t coat the spoon in that sickening \u2013 nay, <em>scary<\/em> \u2013 way that some homemade ice creams do. Instead, <strong>it feels almost ethereally light \u2013 or, at least, as light as a puddle of egg-enriched cream can<\/strong> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">possibly be<\/span>. Finished with a bit of crunchy fleur de sel, it strikes me as a perfect way to dress up and make special the familiar, spiced flavors so typical of Thanksgiving desserts, from apples to pecans and pumpkin. In fact, it would be an ideal topper for any warming, wintry dessert: a gooey-centered square of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/08\/days-that-are-good-flesh-continuingon.html\">brownie<\/a>, maybe, or a pear crisp with toasted hazelnuts. Just last weekend, I served some in a ramekin alongside a slice of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/10\/tokaji-for-your-tarte-tatin.html\">tarte Tatin<\/a>, and we all sat around the table and swooned. It also made a nice snack the next afternoon, eaten from a teacup, with a book on the side. And for those of us who will spend this Thursday in the kitchen, that might be an awfully good plan for Friday.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Salted Caramel Ice Cream<\/strong><br \/>Adapted from <em>The New York Times<\/em> and Nicole Kaplan of Eleven Madison Park, NYC<\/p>\n<p>Before freezing, the base of this ice cream is surprisingly thin. Brandon and I \u2013 suspicious souls that we are \u2013 feared that it wouldn\u2019t freeze properly and, if you\u2019ll believe it, almost <em>threw! the! stuff! away! <\/em>But thank goodness we didn\u2019t, because once frozen, it was silky-smooth. Note, however, that it will likely take longer to freeze than a thicker, more traditional, cooked custard base. We let ours churn for a good 50 minutes \u2013 much longer than the norm for other recipes \u2013 and even when we spooned it out into a container for the freezer, it was still quite soft. It firmed up like a charm, though, after a few hours in the deep freeze. One final to the wise: the caramel here should be allowed to reach a very dark amber color, darker than you might think. If your stove is good and hot, it won\u2019t take long.<\/p>\n<p>1 \u00bc cup granulated sugar, divided<br \/>2 tsp light corn syrup<br \/>2 cups cream, preferably organic<br \/>2 cups whole milk<br \/>10 large egg yolks*<br \/>\u00bd tsp fleur de sel, plus more for serving<\/p>\n<p>Place \u00be cup sugar and the corn syrup in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan. Do not stir. Place the pan over medium-high heat, and cook the mixture to a dark caramel, swirling the pan as it begins to brown to distribute the sugar. Add the cream; then slowly add the milk. The caramel will seize and harden, but don\u2019t be afraid. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then simmer it, stirring, just until the caramel has dissolved.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, place the yolks in a large bowl with the remaining \u00bd cup sugar and the fleur de sel. Whisk to combine.  When the caramel cream is ready, pour a splash of it into the egg mixture to temper, whisking constantly, and then another splash or two for good measure. Then pour the tempered egg mixture into the caramel cream. Whisk thoroughly.<\/p>\n<p>Pour the mixture through a fine-meshed sieve into a medium metal bowl. Place the bowl in an ice bath to cool the mixture completely. Remove the bowl from the ice bath, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight. Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Serve with additional fleur de sel sprinkled on top.<\/p>\n<p>* Technically, Kaplan\u2019s method &#8211; as with many other homemade ice creams &#8211; may not cook the eggs to an adequate temperature to kill <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Salmonella <\/span>bacteria.  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The New York Times<\/span> didn\u2019t make a fuss about it, so I decided not to either, but if you are concerned, click <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cfsan.fda.gov\/%7Edms\/fs-eggs.html\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: about 1 quart<\/p>\n<p>___<\/p>\n<p>And last but not least, if you\u2019re still putting the finishing touches your Thankgiving menu, here are a few ideas from the archives:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/san-francisco-synopsis-with-stockpot.html\">Apple and Butternut Squash Soup<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/11\/in-praise-of-braising.html\">Braised Fennel<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/01\/tender-is-cabbage.html\">Braised Green Cabbage with Onions and Carrots<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/01\/outline-of-theory-of-cabbage.html\">Braised Red Cabbage with Apples and Caraway Seeds<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/11\/case-of-certain-squash-pure.html\">Butternut Pur\u00e9e with Maple Syrup<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/11\/seattlest-gets-jealous-makes-soup.html\">Butternut Squash Soup with Pear, Cider, and Vanilla Bean<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/09\/tremendous-things-what-im-eating-and.html\">Caramelized Cauliflower<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/11\/best-laid-plans-and-linzer-tart.html\">Cranberry Linzer Tart<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/12\/art-of-so-called-side-dishes.html\">Dreamy White Beans<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/10\/how-i-hit-hard-ball-stage.html\">Fresh Ginger Cake with Caramelized Pears<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/11\/seattlest-macrina-true-love-and-ginger.html\">Ginger Pear Upside-Down Cake<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/11\/state-of-sprout.html\">Hashed Brussels Sprouts with Poppy Seeds and Lemon<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/another-excuse-to-talk-biscuits.html\">Sweet Potato Biscuits<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/10\/tokaji-for-your-tarte-tatin.html\">Tarte Tatin<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/11\/gloom-doom-and-biscuits.html\">Touch of Grace Biscuits<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/08\/and-then-cake-came-forth.html\">The Winning-Hearts-and-Minds Cake<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And come back tomorrow, when I will post my family\u2019s favorite take on the cranberry theme, a <strong>cranberry chutney with crystallized ginger and dried cherries<\/strong>.
