So, it seems that I\u2019ve come down with the flu.   Brandon has been sick since last Wednesday, sweating and shivering and coughing, and by Friday evening, it had felled me too.  Unless you count scrambled eggs and a half-hearted batch of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/09\/start-with-tomato-sauce.html\">tomato sauce<\/a>, we have cooked absolutely nothing in the past five days.

Even <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Diablo_Cody\">Diablo Cody<\/a><span> made me sob a little, because she seems like the kind of girl I would have wanted to know in high school, and by god, she made it big.  <\/span>Needless to say, it was a full weekend.<span><br \/><\/span><br \/>So I hope you\u2019ll take a rain check? An IOU?  I\u2019ll even pay interest.  Hell, I\u2019ll pay interest in <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">euros<\/span>.  You won\u2019t be sorry.<\/p>\n<p>Because assuming that we can peel ourselves out of our flannel pajamas, Brandon and I are going out of town tomorrow.   To Europe.   For two weeks.  We\u2019ve been planning it since early December, when our friend <a href=\"http:\/\/olaiyalandcatering.com\/\">Olaiya<\/a> stumbled upon some cheap(!) tickets(!) online.  The three of us started to plot and scheme, and before we knew it, we\u2019d booked tickets to Brussels.  Olaiya lived there for four years and has been itching to show us her old haunts, and anyway, I can\u2019t say no to a country that\u2019s famous for waffles.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, it\u2019s a handy excuse for me and Brandon to go to Paris, just a hop, skip, and a train ride away. We\u2019ve never been there together, and since much of our early bonding consisted, gag-worthily enough, of gushing about <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">macarons<\/span> and Pierre Herm\u00e9, it seems that we\u2019re long overdue.  And he claims that the baguettes from his favorite <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">boulangerie<\/span> can run circles around the baguettes from <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">my<\/span> favorite <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">boulangerie<\/span>, so a showdown is clearly in order.  Anyway, what\u2019s the use of a savings account if you can\u2019t deplete it in one fell swoop?  That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.  That, and that I need a vacation.  And a Kleenex.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you\u2019ll understand.  I had wanted to leave you with something better than dirty dishes &#8211; ideally <a href=\"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9F02EED6143EF935A1575AC0A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=\">this<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/09\/26\/dining\/262prex.html\">this<\/a>, in fact, which I ate on a recent visit to Portland and is possibly the most brilliant dessert <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">ever<\/span> &#8211; but I can\u2019t.  I\u2019m so sorry.  Really.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll be back soon enough, though, with waffles, buttery pastry, and wine to share.  And without the flu.  I hope.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Okay. So, it seems that I\u2019ve come down with the flu.
