You really know your waffles. Thank you. I should ask you for advice more often, because together, you\u2019re absolutely unstoppable. I\u2019m pretty sure that, given a day or two, you could solve any problem, and if I may, I would like to suggest that you start with my pet conundrum: how to make potatoes come out of the ground already fried. I think a lot of us would like to know.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I read your suggestions, every single one of them, and after much hemming and hawing and hand-wringing, I chose two to try. It wasn\u2019t easy, and my thinking went something like this:<\/p>\n<p>Yeasted waffles got the most votes, so I had to make at least one batch. Of the yeasted recipes mentioned, Marion Cunningham\u2019s was cited most often, followed by Mark Bittman\u2019s and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Cook\u2019s Illustrated<\/span>\u2019s. I looked them up, and it turns out, they\u2019re all remarkably similar in ingredients and amounts. I probably could have tossed a coin, if coins had three faces, and been happy with whatever recipe I got. But I chose to try Marion\u2019s, and I chose it for three reasons: 1) again, it was cited most often, 2) it calls for the type of yeast &#8211; active dry, as opposed to instant &#8211; that I usually keep on hand, and 3) it\u2019s very simple, with no beating of egg whites or other additional steps. Also, and maybe you\u2019ve noticed this, but that recipe has been printed and reprinted <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">everywhere<\/span>. It\u2019s been featured in books by Rose Levy Beranbaum and Shirley Corriher. It\u2019s also all over the Internet. Which sort of begs the question of why I didn\u2019t make it for my mother on Mother\u2019s Day, but oh well. I\u2019m a slow learner.<\/p>\n<p>I also wanted to make a waffle that was not yeasted, to be fair. A number of you mentioned the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Joy of Cooking <\/span>recipe. A number of you also pointed me toward a recipe published in and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foodandwine.com\/recipes\/light-and-crispy-waffles\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Food &amp; Wine<\/span><\/a> and <a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.finecooking.com\/recipes\/light_crisp_waffles.aspx\">Fine Cooking<\/a> by cookbook author Pam Anderson, who should not be confused with Pamela Anderson, formerly of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Baywatch<\/span> and Tommy Lee, and I make that clarification because I was, myself, briefly confused. And there were many other suggestions as well, including several good-looking family recipes. But a lot of you also mentioned a recipe called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foodnetwork.com\/recipes\/40-a-day\/waffle-of-insane-greatness-recipe\/index.html\">Waffles of Insane Greatness<\/a> (WIG). A name like that is very, very hard to ignore. It\u2019s ballsy. It felt like a direct challenge, and I must admit, my interest was piqued. Also, oddly enough, I noticed that WIG has a lot in common with Pam Anderson\u2019s recipe, which I took as a good sign. Both called for cornstarch, and their ingredient lists are almost identical, differing only &#8211; and only slightly &#8211; in the amounts of oil, sugar, and vanilla. I decided to go with one of the two, and in the end, I decided on WIG. I wanted to see if it could live up to its title.<\/p>\n<p>Last &#8211; and I\u2019ll getting to the actual tasting soon, I swear &#8211; I wanted to make a waffle with some sort of whole grain flour, because so many of you suggested it. But after much consideration, I decided that it\u2019s a whole other can of worms, and one best opened on another day. To those of you who suggested recipes involving whole wheat flour, spelt flour, oat flour, buckwheat flour, and any other flour, thank you. I\u2019ll get there soon! As soon as I recover from yesterday morning. We made a lot of waffles.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5a2c5-polatwoamazingwaffles-31.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5471993204700918034\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5a2c5-polatwoamazingwaffles-31.jpg?w=292\" alt=\"\" width=\"920\" height=\"946\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nA meeting time of 10:00 am was set, and there were to be five of us eating &#8211; including two cooks from Delancey, Ryan and Brandi, whose palates I knew I could trust. I did not take this lightly. Crust and crumb were poked and prodded, held to the light, thoroughly examined. The smell of yeast and coffee and hot butter hovered over the table, as heavy and palpable as steam.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e96d8-polaamazingwaffleinside-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5471985400279542514\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e96d8-polaamazingwaffleinside-11.jpg?w=292\" alt=\"\" width=\"921\" height=\"947\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nMuch syrup was consumed. The carnage began to pile up. It was ugly. It was a great morning. I ate five waffles, and I lived to see the afternoon.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/3c224-polawafflefaceoff-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5471994585859510930\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/3c224-polawafflefaceoff-11.jpg?w=292\" alt=\"\" width=\"916\" height=\"942\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nI also came away with not one keeper-quality recipe, but <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">two<\/span>. I\u2019m not saying that to be politic. I mean it. Both recipes beat every waffle I have ever had. (Not counting <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">gaufres de Li\u00e8ge<\/span>; those are totally different.) Who could ask for more? I love you, blog. I love you, comments function. I love you, people.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the thing. For me, the Marion Cunningham waffle, the yeasted one, is capital-W Winner. It\u2019s incredibly light and crisp, but the inner crumb is soft, tender, almost custardy. I can\u2019t say enough about that texture. I wanted to eat waffle after waffle after waffle, just for the way it felt between my teeth. It isn\u2019t particularly sweet, which I like very much, and at first appraisal, it can even seem a little salty. But as soon as you pour on some maple syrup, it makes sense: the salt and the sweetness make each other hum. That complexity, plus the complexity brought by the yeast, plus the good hit of butter in the batter, combine to make the kind of flavor that lasts, that hangs around long after the waffle itself is gone. Plus, and this is a big plus, because the yeasted batter requires an overnight rest, you do 90% of the work &#8211; which is very easy work &#8211; the night before. The morning of, you have almost nothing to do, except make some coffee and turn on <a href=\"http:\/\/kexp.org\/programming\/progpage.asp?showID=13&amp;1413=40314.375-1&amp;96=40314.375-1&amp;20=40314.375-1&amp;256=40314.375-2\">the radio<\/a> and feel pleased that you have almost nothing to do. It\u2019s heaven. It\u2019s the top. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4917a-polayeastedwaffle-41.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5471995380099897026\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4917a-polayeastedwaffle-41.jpg?w=293\" alt=\"\" width=\"919\" height=\"942\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThat said, if I didn\u2019t plan ahead, and if I woke up one morning desperately needing a waffle, I would make WIG. And I would be similarly elated. In fact, sitting around the table yesterday, we had a hard time declaring a winner, and at first, it looked as though WIG might be it. When you bite in, it\u2019s absolutely remarkable, with a craggy, shatteringly crisp crust. I\u2019ve never seen or eaten a waffle with so crisp an outer crust. I think the cornstarch is to be thanked for that. The waffle tastes wonderful, too: nicely toasty and caramelized, complex, sweet but not too sweet. But to me, the flavor didn\u2019t persist the way that the flavor of the yeasted waffle did, and it didn\u2019t have the same depth, and I don\u2019t know. It sort of petered out halfway through. It was delicious, and had I never eaten a yeasted waffle, I would drive around all week with the windows down and a megaphone to my mouth, telling the city to make these waffles. But because I <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">have<\/span> now eaten the Marion Cunningham yeasted waffle, I don\u2019t feel quite so moved. It\u2019s all relative. If only I had heard of WIG earlier! Think of what might have been.<\/p>\n<p>Or don\u2019t, and instead, go make some already. If you\u2019ve read this far, you deserve a waffle.<\/p>\n<p>\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Marion Cunningham\u2019s Raised Waffles<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">From <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreakfast-Book-Marion-Cunningham%2Fdp%2F0394555295%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1274130141%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Breakfast Book<\/span><\/a><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2010-05-18T00:34:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/827?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>This recipe uses dry yeast, which is often sold as \u201cactive dry\u201d yeast.

Mine is Belgian-style, and the batter was a bit too thin to really fill it properly. It wasn\u2019t a biggie \u2013 they still taste great, and they\u2019re pretty on one side, at least \u2013 but just, you know, FYI.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd cup warm water\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 package (2 \u00bc tsp.) dry yeast\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 cups whole milk, warmed\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 stick (\u00bd cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tsp. table salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tsp. sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 cups all-purpose flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 large eggs, lightly beaten\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bc tsp. baking soda          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Pour the water into a large mixing bowl.

(Electric beaters do a nice job of this.) Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let it stand overnight at room temperature.<\/p>\n<p>Before cooking the waffles, preheat a waffle maker. Follow your waffle maker\u2019s instruction manual for this, but my guess is that you\u2019ll want to heat it on whatever setting is approximately medium-high. My waffle maker has a heat dial that runs from 1 to 7, and I turned it to 5. My waffle maker is nonstick, so I didn\u2019t grease it, and Marion Cunningham doesn\u2019t call for greasing it, either.<\/p>\n<p>Just before cooking the waffles, add the eggs and baking soda, and stir to mix well. The batter will be very thin. Pour an appropriate amount of batter into your hot waffle maker: this amount will vary from machine to machine, and you should plan to use your first waffle as a test specimen.
