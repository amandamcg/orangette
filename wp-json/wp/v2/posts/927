It\u2019s a dire situation when you go to the dentist, as I did this morning, and it actually feels relaxing, like some sort of reprieve, to get to sit there for an hour with a faceful of metal instruments and suction devices. Listen, you people out there who have babies and operate on a constant sleep deficit and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">STILL<\/span> manage to blog: you\u2019re a miracle. I don\u2019t know how you do it. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that babies are cute? If Delancey could nuzzle my neck and coo, maybe everything would feel easier.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, what I really wanted to say is this: that I haven\u2019t forgotten about you, or about our conversations here, and that I am trying to find my way back. The first step is for me to cut back my hours at the restaurant, which I have just begun to do. Then, of course, I have to figure out where the hell my energy went. And I have to acknowledge, too, that things are just <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">different<\/span> around here. It\u2019s a new balancing act, and I have yet to master it. But I want to.
