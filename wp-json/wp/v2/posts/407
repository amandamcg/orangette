I blame the editor at <i>Bon App\u00e9tit<\/i> who, as the headnote explained, ate this pound cake at a restaurant in Houston and declared it her \u201cdream dessert.\u201d You can\u2019t use words like that and expect people to go on living their lives as though nothing had happened, as though there were not a pistachio pound cake recipe to be tried.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-550 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/19b2f-64610020-21.jpg\" alt=\"19b2f-64610020-2\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1061\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/19b2f-64610020-21.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/19b2f-64610020-21-662x439.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/19b2f-64610020-21-1324x878.jpg 1324w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/19b2f-64610020-21-870x577.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So one night last weekend, I baked a pistachio pound cake. It should be called a pistachio-<i>citrus<\/i> pound cake, really, because it contains juice and zest from three different citrus fruits. The basic batter is classic pound cake &#8211; plenty of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour &#8211; but into that go fresh lemon juice, fresh orange juice (or juice from a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/tangerinemanstore.mybigcommerce.com\/products\/Ojai-Pixie-Tangerines-10-lb-box.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pixie tangerine<\/a>, if you happen to have some on hand; I highly recommend it), some zest from that same orange (or Pixie tangerine), and some zest from a lime. Then you fold in a generous dose of coarsely chopped pistachios, scoop the batter into its loaf pan, and put another generous dose of pistachios on top. Actually, I should warn you: it may seem as though you have <i>too much<\/i> chopped pistachio to cram onto the top of the cake, but you must persevere. There\u2019s no such thing as too much pistachio.<\/p>\n<p>Like other pound cakes I\u2019ve made, this one bakes for a while (about 90 minutes) in a low-to-moderate oven, which is convenient, because it gives you time to redeem yourself by cooking something nutritious &#8211; or, if you prefer, to rest your feet and nurture your two-decades-long fascination with Sexy Frankenstein, also known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=jonny+greenwood&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnslo&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=STeTT9nXL8_RiAL_yZj5Dw&amp;ved=0CEQQsAQ&amp;biw=1379&amp;bih=806&amp;sei=TDeTT5W7HsjRiAKplZDiDw\" target=\"_blank\">Jonny Greenwood<\/a>, by reading that Radiohead story in <a href=\"http:\/\/ateaseweb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/radiohead_rolling_stone_cover_mag.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">the current <i>Rolling Stone<\/i><\/a>. Meanwhile, the house will fill with the scent of toasted pistachio and orange, heady and almost exotic. When you open the oven door to check on your cake, you\u2019ll be rewarded with the sight of a tall, pistachio-crusted, perfectly browned loaf. I\u2019ve done a lot of baking, and I can\u2019t remember another time when I felt so giddy or so proud as I pulled a cake out of the oven. It\u2019s a handsome thing.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1061\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-560\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/bc89f-64610021-11.jpg\" alt=\"bc89f-64610021-1\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/bc89f-64610021-11.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/bc89f-64610021-11-662x439.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/bc89f-64610021-11-1324x878.jpg 1324w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/bc89f-64610021-11-870x577.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<p>We ate the cake plain, in sturdy slices, for breakfast or after lunch, and while it was very good right away, it gets even better, more delicate, once the flavors settle for a day. Like a proper pound cake, it\u2019s firm and buttery, but it gets a gentle lift from the citrus, both in flavor and in fragrance, and then, behind it, there comes the deep, toasty, rumbling flavor of the pistachios. It\u2019s an ideal afternoon cake. If I were going to dress it up for company, I might cut up some strawberries, soften them in a little sugar, and heap them on top of a slice, maybe with some lightly whipped cream &#8211; or, wait, even better, just spoon on some <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2011\/07\/you-dont-forget.html\" target=\"_blank\">strawberry conserve<\/a>.

Lightly butter a 9\u201dx5\u201d loaf pan, or grease it with cooking spray. Cut a rectangle of parchment paper to line the bottom and the two long sides of the pan, leaving a little overhang. Press the parchment paper into the dish, and grease it lightly, too.<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Using an electric mixer, beat the butter on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the sugar, and beat until well incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes more. Add the eggs one at a time, beating to blend between additions. Add the juices and the zests, and beat until well combined. (Don\u2019t worry if the batter looks curdled.) Add the flour mixture, reduce the speed to low, and beat until just incorporated. Add \u00be cup of the pistachios, and fold in gently. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top. Sprinkle the remaining \u00bc cup pistachios over the top.<\/p>\n<p>Bake the cake, rotating it halfway through, until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 \u00bd hours. Transfer it to a wire rack, and let it cool completely in the pan. Run a sharp knife along the short ends of the pan to loosen the cake; then pull up on the parchment paper to lift the cake out of the pan.<\/p>\n<p><i>Note<\/i>: The flavor of this cake is best on the day after it\u2019s made.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 1 loaf<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Earlier this week, I think it was, one of you kindly wrote to me, asking if I might do a post about what I\u2019ve been eating for lunch lately.
