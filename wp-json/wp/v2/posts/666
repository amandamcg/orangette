At one point, through the wall, I could hear an old man in the next room start to sing. The sound was muffled, and I couldn\u2019t make out the words, and he was not what is commonly called a good singer. But he sang easily, cheerfully, the kind of slow, ambling song you might hear someone sing beside a campfire in an old western. He went on like that for maybe ten minutes. I hoped he would go on forever. For the past few days, I\u2019d been wanting to write here, but I wasn\u2019t sure what to say. Then I heard that man singing, and I thought, <i>Well, there you go. This is what you write about. Exactly what\u2019s happening.<\/i><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My family is not having the Christmas that you hear about in carols and television specials.
