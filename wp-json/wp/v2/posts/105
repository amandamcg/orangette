(I highly recommend, by the way, throwing kids\u2019 parties in public parks, preferably ones that include playgrounds. That way, the kids can lose their minds on the slides and teeter-totters while the adults toss around frisbees, lie in the grass, whathaveyou. And: it\u2019s FREE.) This particular park has a sloping lawn that points toward Puget Sound, and that morning, there was a dense fog hanging over the hill. We claimed a couple of picnic tables, hauled the coolers across the lawn, and hoped for sun. Natalie and Michael brought two big balloons, and I brought two strings of paper flags that Natalie made for Eero\u2019s first birthday party last year and then bequeathed to me for June\u2019s first birthday party a month later, after which my father-in-law carefully folded them into a Ziplock for safekeeping and I stashed them away in the kitchen closet, and now that I have typed all of this, I guess it could seem like a real bummer to reuse somebody else\u2019s old party decorations? \u00a0I assure you, these are some really nice flags. We intend to use them until they fall apart.<\/p>\n<p><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/55e73-_f7a40201.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/55e73-_f7a40201.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nBrandon and I bought a <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/01\/brown-bag-it.html\" target=\"_blank\">chickpea salad<\/a>,\u00a0a platter of tomatoes and fresh mozzarella, and a pile of blankets, and Natalie and Michael brought guacamole, Natalie\u2019s famous cucumber dip, chips, water, and a croquet set.

But I like a challenge, or I sometimes like a challenge. I occasionally like a challenge. Anyway, I decided to work on a fudgesicle recipe.<\/p>\n<p><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/19574-_f7a40511.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/19574-_f7a40511.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>There are a lot of them out there, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed. It\u2019s even fair to say that there\u2019s a fudgesicle mini-craze going on right now: Food52, for instance, just ran <a href=\"http:\/\/food52.com\/recipes\/30333-fudgesicles\" target=\"_blank\">a recipe<\/a> for them. My goal was a chocolate popsicle that resembled, at least somewhat, the Jello pudding pops of my childhood. I wanted it to be silky, creamy, dense, and rich, and not even remotely icy, and I wanted the flavor to lean more toward chocolate than cocoa. What I wound up with posed almost no challenge at all, because it\u2019s only a small tweak on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foodnetwork.com\/recipes\/alton-brown\/good-eats-fudgepops-recipe.html\" target=\"_blank\">Alton Brown\u2019s recipe<\/a>. (Thank you, Alton Brown.) It uses only five ingredients: chocolate, cream, milk, a small amount of cocoa, and vanilla extract. It also comes together in maybe 20 minutes. \u00a0As my aunt Tina, one of June\u2019s namesakes, would have said, <i>What\u2019s not to like?\u00a0<\/i>June smelled like chocolate for the rest of the day, and secretly, I hoped she always would.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/572c4-_f7a40681.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/572c4-_f7a40681.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p><i><br \/>\n<\/i>P.S.

Brown calls only for &#8220;bittersweet chocolate,&#8221; but when I tried using 70% cacao chocolate, which I think of as a pretty standard percentage for bittersweet, it made for a <i>very<\/i>\u00a0bittersweet popsicle. More bitter than sweet. Brandon loved it, and June ate it, but it wasn\u2019t really my thing. I like to combine two types of chocolate for this recipe: Valrhona \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.valrhona-chocolate.com\/shop\/Jivara-40-10978.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jivara<\/a>\u201d 40% milk chocolate, and Valrhona \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.valrhona-chocolate.com\/shop\/Manjari-64-10976.html\" target=\"_blank\">Manjari<\/a>\u201d 64% dark chocolate. I use four ounces, or 113 grams, of each. (Yes, they are wildly expensive! I know. We buy them in 3-kg bags at the restaurant, and I regularly steal some for my home use. I am a lucky bastard.) If you don\u2019t want to shell out like that, Scharffen Berger also has a good\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/shop.scharffenberger.com\/41-Milk-Chocolate-Bar\/p\/SFB-CBMILK&amp;c=ScharffenBerger@Chocolate@Milk\" target=\"_blank\">41% milk chocolate<\/a>, and my guess is that it would blend nicely here with either the <a href=\"http:\/\/shop.scharffenberger.com\/62-Semisweet-Chocolate-Bar\/p\/SFB-CBSEMI&amp;c=ScharffenBerger@Chocolate@Dark\" target=\"_blank\">62% semisweet<\/a> or the <a href=\"http:\/\/shop.scharffenberger.com\/70-Bittersweet-Chocolate-Bar\/p\/SFB-CBBITTER&amp;c=ScharffenBerger@Chocolate@Dark\" target=\"_blank\">70% bittersweet<\/a>. Whatever chocolate you choose, I wouldn\u2019t recommend going above 64%, at the highest.<\/p>\n<p>And as for popsicle molds, I use <a href=\"http:\/\/coldmolds.com\/index.php\/pop-molds\/product\/41-cmp4210\" target=\"_blank\">these<\/a>.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            8 ounces (225 grams) chocolate, ideally between 45% and 65% cacao\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd cups (355 ml) heavy cream\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 cup (240 ml) whole milk\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tablespoons (about 11 grams) unsweetened cocoa\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 teaspoons vanilla extract          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Finely chop the chocolate, and put it in a medium bowl.
