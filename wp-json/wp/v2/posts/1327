Especially after the disappointment of last week.  They\u2019re amazing.  Like, really, REALLY amazing.  Like, \u201cwhat stinkin\u2019 budino?\u201d amazing.  Like, tape-the-recipe-to-<br \/>your-fridge-and-fondle-it-each-time-you-pass amazing.  I\u2019ve never heard Brandon cuss so much while eating dessert before.  He was swearing up and down, scraping the empty cup like a man possessed.  They\u2019re real pots of glory, they are, real pots of gold.<\/p>\n<p>And to think &#8211; I\u2019ve had the recipe sitting in my files for more than <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">four<\/span> years.  The poor thing must have been lying there, losing all hope, wondering when, oh <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">when<\/span>, I would take it out and let it shine.  Needless to say, now that I\u2019ve brought it out, I don\u2019t intend to ever put it back.  Never, ever.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0d2a0-butterscotchpotsdecreme062-31.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0d2a0-butterscotchpotsdecreme062-31.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5160365814611092850\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>I clipped the recipe from the October 2003 issue of <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Gourmet<\/span> magazine, and were it not for my iffy experience with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/05\/09\/dining\/091mrex.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin\">butterscotch budino<\/a>, which set me obsessively on the trail of something better, I might have completely forgotten about it.  The recipe comes from an article about a restaurant called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cornexchange.com\/\">The Corn Exchange<\/a> in Rapid City, South Dakota. Its chef, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cornexchange.com\/history.htm\">M. J. Adams<\/a>, sounds like someone I\u2019d like to meet: born in Seattle, trained in New York (where she worked under <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2006\/02\/14\/national\/14lewis.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">Edna Lewis<\/a>, among others), a supporter of farmers\u2019 markets and local agriculture, and the mastermind behind one of the best little recipes to cross my countertop in a long time.  You know you\u2019ve stumbled upon something <span>really<\/span> good when you resent having to share it with anyone &#8211; even your husband, the person with whom you\u2019re supposed to want to share these sorts of things.  I don\u2019t know who wrote the rules of marriage, but they obviously never tasted a butterscotch pot de cr\u00e8me.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the best part of the whole thing is that they\u2019re <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">easy<\/span>.  So easy, in fact, that I made them entirely while talking on the phone &#8211; and talking, no less, about the yet-to-be-determined title of my book, which is incredibly distracting, to say the least.  Thank goodness the method is hard to mess up, as quick and straightforward as can be.  You warm some cream in a saucepan with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Muscovado\">muscovado<\/a> sugar and salt; then, in a second saucepan, you cook a sugar syrup to brown and bubbly.  Then you combine the two, whisk the mixture into a bowl of egg yolks, pour it through a sieve to get rid of any lumps and bumps, and pour it into ramekins.  Then you bake them, cool them, and eat them.  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Ta da<\/span>!<\/p>\n<p>Cold and and rich and almost hyperbolically creamy, the custard yields under the spoon the way a good down pillow does under your head: with a welcoming, slippery <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">whoosh<\/span>.  The gates to heaven have never opened so easily.  Thank you, you\u2019re welcome, I\u2019ll see you inside.<\/p>\n<p>***<\/p>\n<p>Two quick bits of housekeeping:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\">&#8211; Orangette is a finalist in the <a style=\"font-weight:bold;\" href=\"http:\/\/2008.bloggies.com\/\">2008 Bloggies<\/a>!

Thank you, Lori!<\/p>\n<p>***<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Butterscotch Pots de Cr\u00e8me<\/span><br \/>Adapted from M.J. Adams and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Gourmet<\/span>, October 2003<\/p>\n<p>This custard gets its deep, warm flavor from the presence of two special sugars: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Muscovado\">muscovado<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Demerara_sugar\">demerara<\/a>.  It may sound fiddly to call for fancy sugars for a simple little custard like this, but trust me: they really seal the deal.  They\u2019re the axis on which the whole thin spins.  And if you live in a moderate- to good-sized town, they should be fairly easy to find.  Here in Seattle, I\u2019ve bought them at gourmet stores like Whole Foods, but this weekend I even saw them at Ballard Market, my neighborhood grocery.  I like the brand <a href=\"http:\/\/www.indiatree.com\/\">India Tree<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>One more thing: for the water-and-demerara step, be sure to use a light-colored saucepan.  If your pan is made of something dark, like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.calphalon.com\/calphalon\/consumer\/products\/subProductLine.jhtml?catId=CLCat100145\">this<\/a>, it will be darn near impossible to see the color of the mixture as it caramelizes.<\/p>\n<p>1 \u00bd cups heavy cream<br \/>6 Tbsp. dark muscovado sugar<br \/>\u00bc tsp. salt<br \/>6 Tbsp. water<br \/>2 Tbsp. demerara sugar<br \/>4 large egg yolks<br \/>\u00bd tsp. vanilla extract<\/p>\n<p>Set an oven rack in the middle position, and preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F.<\/p>\n<p>In a small heavy saucepan, combine cream, muscovado sugar, and salt.  Place over medium heat and bring just to a simmer, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.  Remove from the heat.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, combine water and demerara sugar in a medium (2-quart) heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Cook, stirring until sugar is dissolved.  Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and bubbly, about 5 minutes.  (To gauge the color of the mixture, it may help to tilt the pan a little, so that the liquid pools on one side.)  Remove from the heat and carefully add the cream mixture, whisking until combined.<\/p>\n<p>In a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks and vanilla.  Add hot cream mixture in a thin stream, whisking constantly.  Set a fine-mesh sieve over a 1-quart glass measuring cup, and pour the custard through the sieve.  Skim off any foam with a spoon.<\/p>\n<p>Divide the custard among four (4-ounce) ramekins or other oven-safe vessels. (I used teacups, just because they\u2019re pretty.  Stoneware and porcelain are safe in the oven at this temperature.) Select a baking dish, one large enough to hold the ramekins without any of them touching.  (I used a 9\u201d x 13.\u201d) Fold a dish towel to line the bottom of the baking dish; this will protect the delicate custards from touching the hot bottom of the pan.  Arrange the ramekins in the pan.  Seal the top of each ramekin with a piece of aluminum foil to prevent a skin from forming as they bake.<\/p>\n<p>Slide the pan into the oven, and immediately pour hot tap water into the pan to reach halfway up the side of the ramekins.  Bake until the custards are set around the edges but still jiggle lightly in the centers when shaken, like firm gelatin, about 40 minutes.  (You\u2019ll have to move the foil to see this.)  Using tongs, transfer the ramekins to a rack.  Discard foil tops and cool to room temperature.  The custards will continue to set as they cool.  Refrigerate for a couple of hours, or until you\u2019re ready to serve them.<\/p>\n<p>Serve plain or topped with a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Note<\/span>: These are best on the first day, but they\u2019ll keep, covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated, for up to two days.  The texture slowly declines and they develop a thin skin on top, but it certainly didn\u2019t stop us from eating them.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 4 servings<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I come to you today to redeem myself.
