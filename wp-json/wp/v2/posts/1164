Needless to say, this was very exciting.  The best part was, they were <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">huge<\/span>.  Our yard is fenced on only two sides, and the bushes were sufficiently large that, on one of the unenclosed sides, they formed a partial wall along the property line.  As walls go, it was somewhat ugly and unkempt, but it was <span>covered<\/span> in blackberries.  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Covered<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>So we started picking, and then we picked some more.  We made blackberry sorbet and a batch of jam.  One afternoon, I decided to make some scones, so I went out with an empty Tupperware to harvest a little more.  I was hunched over, picking intently on our side of the bush-wall, daydreaming about baked goods and probably humming something innocent and uplifting, when I heard footsteps.  I looked up to see our next-door neighbor, the one whose yard adjoins the bushes, marching across the lawn.  She came to a stop a few feet away, looked me up and down, and then spat, \u201cWhat <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">the hell<\/span> do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Stunned, I giggled nervously and explained that we had just moved in, and that I had this great scone recipe that my sister had given me, and that I wanted to make a batch with fresh blackberries, and giggle giggle giggle.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell, this is <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">my<\/span> bush,\u201d she snapped.  \u201cI planted it.  And I use it every summ<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">ah<\/span> to make blackberry c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">ooorr<\/span>dial.\u201d [In my mind, when I replay our conversation, I give her an upper-class British accent, even though she doesn\u2019t have one.  I think it makes her seem especially stern, don\u2019t you?  Like a strict governess, or maybe Queen Elizabeth.]<\/p>\n<p>I wish I could tell you that I had a smart retort at the ready, or that I shot her down by pointing out that this particular side of the bush fell on <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">my<\/span> property or that blackberries are, in this part of the country, a non-native invasive weed, not something that one generally plants.  In fact, they are considered a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kingcounty.gov\/environment\/animalsAndPlants\/noxious-weeds\/weed-identification\/blackberry.aspx\">Weed of Concern<\/a> by King County &#8211; I love that term, \u201cWeed of Concern\u201d &#8211; and if she did indeed plant these bushes, my (tall, imposing) landlord would probably like to have a word with her and, possibly, request that she pay a gardener to remove the bushes from my side of the property line.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I only thought of these things after I had skulked away and gone inside to lie down and contemplate the general cruelty of the universe.  I also contemplated the Robert Frost poem \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.poets.org\/viewmedia.php\/prmMID\/15719\">Mending Wall<\/a>\u201d and its wise line, \u201cGood fences make good neighbors.\u201d  I love our delicate bush-wall, but for a minute there, I wished for something a little more substantial, like wood or brick or stone.  Preferably with barbed wire on top.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/bf719-polablackberryonsteps-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/bf719-polablackberryonsteps-11.jpg?w=298\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5235967465424195074\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Of course, I am able to tell you this now because our neighbor is no longer our neighbor.  She still owns the property next door, but she moved out about a year ago and rented it to a couple of girls who are not only nice, but whose wardrobes and hair I covet.  And last Friday afternoon, when it was scorchingly hot and all the blackberries were fat and warm, I took my Tupperware and went picking.  I came back inside a half hour later with one pound of berries &#8211; having also, in that time, had a very nice conversation, pet a cute pug, been invited to a party, and received a glass of lemonade.  I feel much better about everything.<\/p>\n<p>And while I can\u2019t exactly spread the good will by inviting you to the party, which already happened, or by sharing the lemonade, which I already drank, I am happy to pass along the recipe for the frozen yogurt that I made from the blackberries.  I based it on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidlebovitz.com\/\">David<\/a>\u2019s recipe for strawberry frozen yogurt, which I made twice last month and highly, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">highly<\/span> recommend.  It\u2019s not frozen yogurt in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pinkberry.com\/html\/pbmain.php\">Pinkberry<\/a> sense, so don\u2019t start expecting a mound of rippling soft-serve, but it <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">is<\/span> utterly delicious &#8211; and, in my book, so much better.  Also, it\u2019s dead-easy.  You macerate the berries in sugar and a small splash of vodka, puree them with plain yogurt and lemon juice, and freeze.  That\u2019s all.  Think sorbet, essentially, but with a gentle roundness and soft tang from the addition of yogurt.  Our friend <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/05\/entirely-unmannerly.html\">Ben<\/a> declared it \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">terrif<\/span>,\u201d for which we teased him mercilessly.  He was right, though, and assuming that our good neighbors agree, I think I will make another batch this week.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Blackberry Frozen Yogurt<\/span><br \/>Inspired by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPerfect-Scoop-Sorbets-Granitas-Accompaniments%2Fdp%2F1580088082&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The Perfect Scoop<\/span><\/a>, by David Lebovitz<\/p>\n<p>1 pound fresh blackberries, rinsed<br \/>\u00be cup sugar<br \/>2 tsp. vodka<br \/>1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt<br \/>1 \u00bd tsp. fresh lemon juice<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, toss the blackberries with the sugar and vodka, stirring until the sugar begins to dissolve.  Cover, and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.<\/p>\n<p>In a blender, process the blackberries and their liquid with the yogurt and lemon juice until smooth.  (I generally do this in two batches; it seems to work better that way.)  Place a mesh sieve over a medium bowl, and pour the mixture through the sieve to remove the seeds.  Taste.  It should be a little too sweet at this point, but that\u2019s good; it will taste less sweet when frozen.<\/p>\n<p>Refrigerate the mixture for one hour.  Then freeze in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 1 scant quart<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The summer before last, I had a run-in with one of our neighbors over a blackberry bush.
