It lives on my kitchen counter with my favorite go-to cookbooks, and it\u2019s the one I reach for, without fail, when I think brownies. <\/p>\n<p>These dark, deeply chocolatey, oozy things aren\u2019t your typical specimens: they\u2019re what brownies on sad party tables everywhere aspire to be. All too often, \u201cbrownies\u201d are just so-so: oddly black, dry around the edges, super-sweet, or\u2014the horror!\u2014spongy, like cake. Not these: they\u2019re crackly on top with a soft, gooey interior, fudgy and rich, buttery and serious and very, very sophisticated. If you\u2019re of the cakey-brownie persuasion, these aren\u2019t for you. But if you like a brownie that melts on your tongue with a flood of buttery chocolate, read on.<\/p>\n<p>1 \u00bc cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>1 tsp salt<br \/>2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter<br \/>4 ounces best-quality unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped<br \/>2 ounces best-quality bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped<br \/>2 cups granulated sugar<br \/>1 tsp pure vanilla extract<br \/>4 large eggs<\/p>\n<p>Center a rack in the oven, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.<\/p>\n<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and salt; set aside.<\/p>\n<p>Melt the butter and the chocolate together in the top of a double boiler over\u2014but not touching\u2014simmering water (or in a metal bowl over a saucepan of simmering water), stirring frequently. When the chocolate and butter are both melted and smooth, add 1 cup of the sugar to the mixture, and stir it for 30 seconds; then remove the mixture from the heat, and stir in the vanilla extract. Pour the mixture into a large bowl.<\/p>\n<p>Put the remaining 1 cup sugar and the eggs into a medium bowl, and whisk by hand to combine. Little by little, pour half of the sugar and eggs into the chocolate mixture, stirring gently but constantly with a rubber spatula so that the eggs don\u2019t scramble from the heat. Beat the remaining sugar and eggs on medium speed until they are thick, pale, and doubled in volume, about 3 minutes. Using the rubber spatula, gently fold the whipped eggs and sugar into the chocolate mixture. When the eggs are almost completely incorporated, gently fold in the dry ingredients.<\/p>\n<p>Pour and scrape the batter into an unbuttered 8-inch square pan (I\u2019ve found a heavy nonstick metal brownie pan to be ideal, although the original recipe recommends ceramic or glass). Bake the brownies for 25-28 minutes, during which time they will rise a bit and the top will turn dry and a bit crackly. After 23 minutes, stick a knife or toothpick into the center to see how they are progressing. They should be just barely set\u2014not too raw, but still fairly gooey (mine generally take the full 28 minutes, if not a touch more). Cool the brownies in the pan on a rack. When they\u2019re completely cool, cut them into rectangular bars to serve.<\/p>\n<p>Note: These brownies will keep, at room temperature or refrigerated, for 2-3 days. They also freeze beautifully, although they never freeze solid\u2014a bonus (or horrible danger) if you, like me, are known to consider eating them straight from the freezer.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 18 fantastically rich brownies <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am firmly of the belief that a meal has not officially ended until one has eaten something sweet.
