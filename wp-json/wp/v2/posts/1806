A slow fog rolled between two hills, and in the distance, the Cascades foretold winter with their jagged white caps.<\/p>\n<p>We arrived just before noon with empty stomachs, and Nicho threw together a delicious omelette-scramble of sorts\u2014saut\u00e9ed onions and garlic with fresh chard from the garden, a splash of his \u201csecret sauce,\u201d fork-scrambled eggs, slivers of tomato, and generous slices of cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. Nicho\u2019s mother Martha joined us, and we sat and ate and talked. Then, while Nicho sunk into a food coma on the couch, <strong>his very gracious mother showed me how to bake her sweet, dense, and addictive wheat bread<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/10\/Wheat-bread1.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p>She, remarkable woman that she is, grinds her own red winter wheat and makes the nutty dough from memory and with a minimum of measuring, adding shakes of triticale, wheat germ, wheat bran, and oats entirely by eye and by feel. <strong>We tasted the raw dough and nodded our appreciation, kneaded and folded and pinched and tucked it into pans<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>While the loaves rose, we roused Nicho, pulled on big rubber boots, and went outside to trim hooves. Not being a strapping man with a helmet, I stood back and watched as Nicho and his father Hans wrestled the quarrelsome sheep (whose names include Kerry and Dubya; I <em>adore<\/em> these people) and quieted the skittish llamas.<\/p>\n<p>Late afternoon brought thick slices of fresh, steaming bread; a bit of kitchen-dancing with Nicho in his work overalls (who kindly put up with my bumbling and giggling); a walk down to the river and stick-throwing for <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/10\/like-leaves_03.html\">Index<\/a>; the piercing brightness of a receding sun; and a red nose for me. Returning to the house, we found Martha preparing a warming dinner of lentil soup with shavings of white cheddar, roasted acorn squash with sliced apples, and aforementioned bread. Nicho and I collaborated on some saut\u00e9ed rainbow chard and broccoli with onion, garlic, and a squeeze of lemon. <strong>Dark had come early<\/strong>, as is fitting of this late-October date, and I realized happily that I\u2019d hardly looked at my watch all day, content to let the hours come and go as they pleased.<\/p>\n<p>This morning\u2019s sunrise was slow and tentative, as was I. Nicho half-jokingly read to me from a book on the last ice age as rust-colored leaves swirled past outside. We learned the difference between mastodons and mammoths and admired their sturdy columnar legs, but given our languor, <strong>we resembled nothing so much as the giant sloth<\/strong>. It was delicious. Around midday, loaf of bread under my arm, I climbed reluctantly into my car and pointed it southwest, back to Seattle and concrete and anthropology and e-mail and Monday.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every week should begin this way: watching the sun rise over the Cascades from a warm bed next to an enormous window, the wind whistling outside, a flock of tiny birds circling and swooping above the spruce.
