Sometimes I hardly know myself at all.<\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s not talk about food right now.  Instead, I thought we might have a Restaurant Day.  Because a major detail has been decided since I first told you about <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/11\/i-cant-wait.html\">the restaurant<\/a>, and we want to share it with you.  Namely, the name.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d003e-266900141.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d003e-266900141.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285248417858729394\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>The restaurant is going to be called Delancey.  We chose it because it reminds us of New York, and since Brandon\u2019s pizza sensibility is so rooted there, it seems fitting.  It\u2019s the name of a street in Manhattan, as well as a subway stop, and though it\u2019s not in a particularly glamorous part of town, when Brandon was living in New York, it was one of his favorite stations: always bustling, packed with all sorts of people going to all sorts of places.  Plus, isn\u2019t it a pretty word?  To me, it feels kind of classy and old-fashioned, like dark wood and tarnished copper and old men in tweed suits smoking cigars.  Not that the restaurant will necessarily include any of those things, but we like the idea.<\/p>\n<p>Also, for those of you who asked and those who have speculated, Delancey will be in Ballard, on 70th Street NW, between 14th and Alonzo Avenues.   There\u2019s a sweet little strip of businesses there, and Brandon is thrilled to have snatched a spot among them.  Number 1415, to be precise.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/120dc-42460010-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/120dc-42460010-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285249464174076610\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>I went over to the space a couple of weeks ago, in the midst of the big snowstorm, and I took some photographs for you.  The place doesn\u2019t look anything like a restaurant yet, so don\u2019t get too excited.  I just thought you might like to see it in all its various stages, from ladders and dust (right now) to the day the doors open (in early spring, we hope).  If you\u2019d like to view any of the photographs in a larger size, just click on them.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/af35b-42460003-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/af35b-42460003-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285248843978238162\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Right now, Brandon is working on pretty boring things: picking out toilet fixtures, submitting applications for various permits, and scraping down the popcorn ceiling.  But I think there\u2019s often something beautiful about boring things, like light fixtures and painter\u2019s tape.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/62676-424400051.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/62676-424400051.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285248832677349282\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Or a mural of two ships, sailing peacefully across the wall above the main door.  Once we start painting, I have a feeling it won\u2019t be there anymore.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ec2be-42460007-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ec2be-42460007-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285249445787012418\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>There are also lots of buckets.  Soon they won\u2019t be there anymore either.  I won\u2019t miss them.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/13243-42460004-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/13243-42460004-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285250395765379554\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/93f96-424400021.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/93f96-424400021.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285248829290506530\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Here\u2019s a prep table. It holds the all-important bag of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/12\/look-at-that.html\">Cool Ranch Doritos<\/a>. And in the back there, you can see the three-compartment sink that will go in the kitchen. When Brandon brought it from the restaurant supply store, it fit into our friend Bonnie\u2019s car by mere centimeters.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/07ce4-42460008-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/07ce4-42460008-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285249459329142706\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>And here are Brandon\u2019s new best friends, a surgical mask and a scraper, his tools for removing the gnarly popcorn ceiling.  (He had it tested for asbestos, and it came back safe, so please don\u2019t worry.)  They\u2019ve spent lots of hours together, that man, that mask, and that scraper.  Personally, I like spending time with the boom box on the chair.  While I took this photograph, it played Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cGlory Days\u201d for me.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ebd46-42460001-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ebd46-42460001-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5285248832485515234\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>I think that\u2019s all for now, but when we have more to show and tell, we certainly will.  There are more Restaurant Days to come, for sure.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, here\u2019s to a warm and bright New Year!  I hope your 2009 is even better than you can imagine.
