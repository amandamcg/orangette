The crust of each little orb is uncannily crisp, meeting the tooth with a good, satisfying crack. Beneath, the crumb is <strong>moist, dense, and deceptively light<\/strong>, somewhere between cake doughnut and sponge cake. Even with a snowy cap of sugar, they\u2019re only subtly sweet\u2014<strong>the sort of thing that goads you, ever so slyly, into a second helping<\/strong>.

These are a cinch to make, and very quick too. If you, like me, are inclined to think that fried dough makes for a good dessert, whip up a batch of batter before you make dinner, slip it into the fridge to chill, and then heat the oil while you eat your main course. These fritters would also be a wonderful\u2014and wonderfully unfussy\u2014addition to a brunch menu, with the special bonus of being easily made the morning of. And should you have any leftovers, be sure to let them cool thoroughly before sealing them in an airtight container or bag, so that they don\u2019t get soggy.<\/p>\n<p>2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>2 tsp baking powder<br \/>\u00be cup granulated sugar<br \/>\u00bd cup whole-milk plain yogurt<br \/>2 large eggs<br \/>3 Tbs fresh lemon juice (about 1 lemon\u2019s worth)<br \/>1 Tbs honey<br \/>1 Tbs vegetable oil, such as canola, plus more for frying<br \/>Powdered sugar, for serving<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder.

Add the flour mixture, and gently fold and stir with a rubber spatula until just combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Do not overmix. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate the batter until chilled, about 1 hour.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Yogurt_doughnuts_no_sugar.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/04\/Yogurt_doughnuts_no_sugar.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>When you are ready to fry, pour oil into a wide heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven to a depth of about 2 inches.
