With no real hunger or purpose, I make, say, three mini-loaves of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/mussels-wine-and-excuse-to-eat-whipped.html\">fancy banana bread<\/a>, a batch of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/08\/i-took-deep-breaths.html\">strawberry scones<\/a>, a loaf of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/11\/on-self-sufficiency-and-sourdough.html\">sourdough<\/a>, and barrelfuls of Italian vegetable soup\u2014all in less than twenty-four hours, and mostly on a Friday night, no less. Behold the pinnacle of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/01\/outline-of-theory-of-cabbage.html\">geekiness<\/a>! But because a girl\u2019s got to keep these things in check, I usually make sure that<strong> my bouts of industriousness are immediately followed by a good dose of sloth<\/strong>, generally in the company of someone upon whom I can foist some of the products of my labor. Hence Saturday night\u2019s languorous session on the couch, spooning whipped cream and sipping wine, wearing unusually wavy bedroom hair, and snorting and guffawing in intentionally bad French with <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/mussels-wine-and-excuse-to-eat-whipped.html\">Kate<\/a>. Whoever said that sloth is a deadly sin has obviously never spent an evening with us.<\/p>\n<p>I arrived at Kate\u2019s with a heavy bag of loot: a crusty homemade sourdough boule, my jagged-toothed W\u00fcsthof bread knife, a wedge of bleu d\u2019Auvergne from my personal ripening cellar (a.k.a. the refrigerator), a baggie of scones, and a Tupperware full of still-warm soup. Taking stock of our wares and coming up short, we ran down to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.delaurenti.com\/\">DeLaurenti\u2019s<\/a>, barraged the poor wine saleswoman with inarticulate questions about Italian reds, and returned to Kate&#8217;s with a bottle of Argiolas Perdera Isola dei Nuraghi 2002, jammy, spicy, and as fun to pronounce as it is to drink. I set the table\u2014complete with the few napkins I <em>didn\u2019t<\/em> set on fire at <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/09\/26-or-almost.html\">my birthday dinner<\/a>\u2014while she washed lettuce and handfuls of peppery watercress. With rain falling on the cold streets outside, we sat down to a warming winter dinner: steaming bowls of soup, hearty with carrots, cabbage, zucchini, Swiss chard, and sweet white beans,<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/01\/Fretwell-soup%2C-served_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/>and, on the side, greens with vinaigrette, creamy bleu d\u2019Auvergne, and chewy bread.<\/p>\n<p>And, because we needed to meet our regular whipped-cream quota, we collaborated on a now-routine-but-still-exhilarating <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/08\/and-then-cake-came-forth.html\">g\u00e2teau au chocolat fondant<\/a>, which, incidentally, gave me a chance to show off my natural grace in the kitchen. Not only did I drop <strong>a chocolate-batter-covered spoon<\/strong> on the floor and nearly knock over a pitcher of kitchen utensils while making the thing, but, once it was out of the oven and cool, I shot a knife across the kitchen trying to serve it. I just get so <em>eager<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/01\/Dropped-knife_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/>Kate, on the other hand, whipped the cream with <strong>uncommon elegance<\/strong>. <\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/01\/KK-whipping-cream_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/>We collapsed onto the couch and, wine glasses and bowl of cream nearby, made fast work of the cake. Then, in only a couple of hours, <strong>we planned<\/strong> <strong>our entire lives and a cocktail party<\/strong>. Even in times of slothfulness, we can\u2019t help but be productive.<\/p>\n<p>And what\u2019s more, before I left, we even took out the trash.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/01\/Rubbish-chute-cropped_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/>The <strong>rubbish chute<\/strong> is the highlight of every visit chez Kate. I <em>adore<\/em> it, and, knowing this, Kate saves her very best trash just for me. I\u2019ve thrown into the chute&#8217;s greedy mouth everything from a candy-coated apple to a bag full of mussel shells, and I can\u2019t get enough of the <strong>clicketty-clacketty-THUMP!<\/strong> of trash tumbling down through the darkness. It\u2019s pure heaven. Someday I\u2019ll have a rubbish chute of my own, and I\u2019ll fulfill my dream of sliding down it. I\u2019ve long had visions of putting myself in small, confined spaces: cabinets, the space under airplane seats, and so on. When I was moving into my current apartment, I crawled into a corner cabinet in the kitchen and had my mother close the door behind me. It was strangely satisfying, if only for a few seconds. A rubbish-chute ride would surely be divine, if painful.<\/p>\n<p>Coming home and sighing contentedly, I gave thanks for so much industry and indolence by turning out the light and tumbling down through the darkness to my bed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fretwell (Italian Vegetable) Soup<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This soup recipe comes from the Fretwell family, longtime friends in Oklahoma, and they in turn discovered it somewhere in Italy. I have only a blurry Xeroxed copy of the recipe (which the Fretwells had faxed to them from wherever they first ate it), and so I thus cannot give credit here to its original author. That\u2019s a true shame, because this is one of the most delicious vegetable soups I\u2019ve ever tasted. The Fretwells brought us many meals while <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/two-years.html\">my father<\/a> was ill, and this was one we requested repeatedly. But consider yourself warned: this recipe makes a veritable cauldron of soup. If you don\u2019t have a stockpot that can hold twelve quarts or so, do this in two batches, or halve the recipe.<\/p>\n<p>1 \u00bd lbs. dried cannellini or Great Northern beans<br \/>Olive oil<br \/>Salt<br \/>2 or 3 fresh sage leaves<br \/>1 or 2 garlic cloves, peeled and left whole<br \/>2 or 3 medium yellow onions, chopped<br \/>8 medium carrots, sliced into \u00bc-inch coins<br \/>5 celery stalks, trimmed and sliced into \u00bc-inch crescents<br \/>2 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise and sliced into \u00bc-inch half-circles<br \/>1 bunch red Swiss chard, washed, dried, and sliced<br \/>\u00bd head green cabbage, cored and chopped roughly<br \/>1 quart vegetable broth (I used Imagine brand)<br \/>1 28-oz can whole peeled tomatoes, juices reserved and tomatoes chopped roughly<\/p>\n<p>Soak the beans overnight. The next day, drain them, put them into a large pot, add water to cover by 2 inches, and cook, with sage and garlic, for about one hour. As the beans cook, skim off any white foam that rises to the surface, and halfway through their cooking time, add \u00bd Tbs salt.<\/p>\n<p>Heat 2 or 3 Tbs olive oil in a large soup pot, add onions, carrots, and celery, and saut\u00e9 for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, salting lightly, and adding more oil if necessary. Add the zucchini and the vegetable broth, cover, and bring mixture to a simmer. Then add Swiss chard, cabbage, tomatoes, and tomato juices. Cover the pot, and simmer over low heat for half an hour or so. Add the beans and their cooking water, salt to taste, and simmer, covered, over low heat for one hour, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve over slices of day-old crusty bread, and garnish with a drizzle of olive oil if you like.<\/p>\n<p>Serves scads\u2014but scads!\u2014of people.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every now and then, something comes over me, and I produce.
