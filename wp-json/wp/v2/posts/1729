For ours, still sun-warm and very sweet, we wanted something simple\u2014no terrines or towers. So, loosely following O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s guidance, we sent sheet pans full of halved tomatoes into a low oven, and six hours later, we retrieved them to find<strong> their edges crinkled like thick fabric and their juices concentrated and syrupy<\/strong>. They were fleshy, with veins that rose to the surface under the heat, and when we bit into them, they shot thick vermilion juice onto the tabletop.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Slow_roasted_tomatoes_veins_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/08\/Slow_roasted_tomatoes_veins_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>They may take six hours to reach fruition, but straight from the oven, a slow-roasted tomato is instant gratification. It\u2019s almost impossible to keep stray fingers out of them; they\u2019re like <strong>rubies in fruit form<\/strong>. And though they are delicious plain, their sweet acidity also plays remarkably well with other flavors, especially those dishes at the rich, robust end of the spectrum: a creamy <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/01\/on-souffl-and-trepidation.html\">cheese souffl\u00e9<\/a>, maybe, or a plate of<em> <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/08\/trofie-al-pesto-with-drama-and.html\"><em>trofie al pesto<\/em><\/a>. Paired with fresh ch\u00e8vre, peppery arugula, and pesto, they make for a luscious, drippy sandwich, and fanned over the top of a burger, they\u2019re <strong>ketchup for the adult set<\/strong>. Even the tried-and-tired <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Insalata_Caprese\">Caprese salad<\/a> becomes an entirely new thing with slow-roasted tomatoes in place of raw. Brandon has his sights set on trying them in a pizza sauce, but in the meantime, I love to slice a handful of them into a bowl with slivered basil, capers, sea salt, and splashes of balsamic and olive oil: an improvised sauce for whatever pasta happens to land in the boiling pot. And on nights when the stove is too much to consider, few things make for a happier picnic\u2014on the floor or in the grass\u2014than a hunk of crusty bread, a fat wedge of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/cgi-bin\/article.cgi?file=\/chronicle\/archive\/2005\/06\/16\/WIGH4D8E1Q1.DTL&amp;type=wine\">bleu d\u2019Auvergne<\/a>, and slow-roasted tomatoes.<\/p>\n<p>With a little foresight, you can arrange to have them always in your fridge, ready and waiting. I\u2019ve never been one to believe, anyway, that happiness can\u2019t be planned.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Slow-Roasted Tomatoes with Sea Salt and Ground Coriander<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve played enough with O\u2019Neill\u2019s formula that I think it\u2019s now safe to claim it as my own\u2014and anyway, it\u2019s loose enough to hardly be called a recipe at all. I\u2019ve tried sprinkling various herbs and spices onto the tomatoes; I\u2019ve baked them for four hours sometimes and six hours others*; I\u2019ve roasted 10 one day and 28 the next. I\u2019ve even carried my experimentation into winter\u2014seasonal blasphemy, I know\u2014and with almost summery results. Unlike their more delicate cousins, decent Roma tomatoes can be found almost year-round, and after a few hours in the oven, they make a fine rebuttal to a cold January night. In fact, for this preparation, I now choose almost exclusively Romas, even in the summertime. Dusted with a little salt and ground coriander\u2014the (now not-so-)secret weapon that makes this recipe a keeper\u2014they take on a full, almost winey flavor, and they hold their shape beautifully. Don\u2019t hesitate to roast a lot at a time; they keep well in the fridge, sealed up tight, for several days.<\/p>\n<p>Ripe tomatoes, preferably Roma<br \/>Olive oil<br \/>Sea salt<br \/>Ground coriander<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.<\/p>\n<p>Wash the tomatoes, cut off the stem end, and halve them lengthwise. Pour a bit of olive oil into a small bowl, dip a pastry brush into it, and brush the tomato halves lightly with oil. Place them, skin side down, on a large baking sheet. Sprinkle them with sea salt and ground coriander\u2014about a pinch of each for every four to six tomato halves.<\/p>\n<p>Bake the tomatoes until they shrink to about 1\/3 of their original size but are still soft and juicy, 4 to 6 hours. [I usually let mine go for the maximum time.] Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and allow the tomatoes to cool to room temperature. Place them in an airtight container, and store them in the refrigerator.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">*If the thought of leaving the oven on for 4-6 hours in the summertime makes you overheat on the spot, consider starting a batch first thing in the morning. By the time the day\u2019s heat kicks into full throttle, they\u2019ll be finished, and so will your oven.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The word \u201chappiness\u201d has many definitions, but I\u2019m quite convinced that if you looked it up in one of those nifty visual dictionaries, what you\u2019d see is a pan of slow-roasted tomatoes.
