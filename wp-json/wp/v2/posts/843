Eaten cold, ideally.<\/p>\n<p>This particular recipe was inspired by a series of seasonal recipe collections called <a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http:\/\/thecanalhouse.com\/\">Canal House Cooking<\/a>, which I learned about from my friend <a href=\"http:\/\/3191.visualblogging.com\/\">Maria<\/a>. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Canal House Cooking<\/span> is hard to describe, and I love that about it. Written, photographed, illustrated, and published by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/12\/02\/dining\/02canal.html\">Christopher Hirsheimer and Melissa Hamilton<\/a>, a founding editor of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Saveur<\/span> magazine and the former food editor of the same, respectively, it\u2019s part magazine and part cookbook, published in three volumes a year: Summer, Fall &amp; Holiday, and Winter &amp; Spring. I bought a three-volume subscription when I first learned of it, and when the third volume arrived a few weeks ago, I renewed my subscription in under 24 hours. I think this makes me an official fan. I want to cook almost every recipe they print, and the books themselves are so inviting, so elegant but easygoing in tone, that I sort of want to carry one around with me everywhere, just to keep the good feeling going. I think this makes me an official creepy person.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, in the most recent volume, the third one, Winter &amp; Spring, there is a recipe for roasted rhubarb in red wine, and it caught my eye. So when I spotted some rhubarb at the farmers\u2019 market last weekend, I bought a couple of pounds with this recipe in mind. As it happened, however, when I got home, I discovered that I didn\u2019t have an open bottle of red wine lying around. It seemed wasteful to open a new one only to use a small portion, so I decided to use the open bottle of white wine that I <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">did<\/span> have lying around. I\u2019m not sure how my white wine version compares to the original, and I may never find out, because now that I\u2019ve made it this way, I feel no desire to make anything else, ever. Not before next spring. You understand.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/a1ff9-polarhubarbclose1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5453545728936152434\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/a1ff9-polarhubarbclose1.jpg?w=297\" alt=\"\" width=\"1213\" height=\"1224\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Cooked rhubarb rarely wins beauty contests, and this recipe won\u2019t change that record. But it\u2019s delicious enough that I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s fresh rhubarb, cut into short lengths, tossed in a pot with wine and sugar and a vanilla bean, baked until it goes tender enough to slump juicily on the end of a fork. I\u2019ve made a very similar recipe that called for water instead of wine and orange zest instead of vanilla, and it\u2019s very good, too. But what\u2019s outstanding about this is just that: the wine and the vanilla. Where water works fine, wine brings a flavor and fragrance of its own, an added dimension, a dose of sweetness and acidity that balance and complement the flavor of rhubarb. And though I do like rhubarb with orange in almost any incarnation, vanilla bean is subtler, able to bring out and underline the best in rhubarb without masking it. It\u2019s not too sweet, and it\u2019s not too tart, and though it would probably be nice with Greek yogurt or ice cream or a simple cake, I take mine straight, by which I mean straight out of the refrigerator. I don\u2019t even need a plate.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Roasted Rhubarb<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Inspired by Canal House Cooking, Volume 3<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2010-03-29T07:25:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/843?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>For the wine here, I used our house white at Delancey: Ch\u00e2teau de Pellehaut Harmonie de Gascogne, a blend of Ugni Blanc, Colombard, Gros Manseng, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc.
