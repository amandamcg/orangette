I\u2019m still recovering from the five pizzas &#8211; FIVE! &#8211; we ate during our three days in Manhattan, not to mention the sour gummy stars I got in my Christmas stocking and have been eating obsessively for the past week until yesterday, when, in a last-ditch effort to regain my sanity, I threw the last of the bag away, rescuing my tongue mere moments before the \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sour_sanding\">sour sanding<\/a>,\u201d or whatever it\u2019s called, could scour away my last taste bud.  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Phew<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>No, really, I\u2019m not going to write for long today.  I just wanted to stop in and tell you about some happy news that\u2019s come my way.  It\u2019s only appropriate, I think, given that it\u2019s the beginning of a new year, and who doesn\u2019t like happy news on New Year\u2019s?  (Lord knows <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/01\/happy-new.html\">I do<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>What I want to share with you is this: that I am now [<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">insert squeal<\/span>] writing for <a style=\"font-weight:bold;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/bonappetit\/\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Bon App\u00e9tit<\/span><\/a><span>.  As of the February 2008 issue, I am a monthly columnist for the magazine.  My column is called <\/span>\u201cCooking Life,\u201d and in it, I\u2019ll be sharing stories of discovery in my kitchen and beyond &#8211; with recipes, of course.  (The first recipe is for lamb sausage patties with fresh mint, feta, and garlic.)  The column has been in the works since last July &#8211; I had my first phone meeting about it only six days before my wedding; it was a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">teeensy<\/span> bit of a stressful week &#8211; but I didn\u2019t want to tell you about it until it was in print, until it felt really-and-truly real.  And now, holy cow, it is, and it does.  If you\u2019re a subscriber, you may already have your February issue.  If not, it\u2019ll be on newsstands very soon.  Either way, I do hope you\u2019ll keep an eye out for it. I would never have had the opportunity to do this if it weren\u2019t for you, you know &#8211; you and your cheers.  Really.  I mean it.  You, you, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">you<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c4439-portland040-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c4439-portland040-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5150656310856056034\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>So today, I raise my glass in your direction.  I wish you the happiest of New Years, friends.  2007 was an awfully big one around here, and awfully fast too.  This year, I want to learn to slow down a little. Doesn\u2019t that sound nice?   I want to take more walks.  I want to sit on the couch and read.  I want to drink more beer and listen to more records.   I want to know Seattle even better. I\u2019ve never been one for New Year\u2019s resolutions, but walking and sitting and reading and beer and records and Seattle, well, those, yes, I can do.<\/p>\n<p>I hope your 2008 is slow and lovely and everything you want, with all the happiness your heart can hold.<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c4439-portland040-11.jpg\"><br \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s only been five years, or five years and change, since I moved to Seattle.
