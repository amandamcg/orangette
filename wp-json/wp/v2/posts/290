But there is no cake here, and that is because there is no oven. \u00a0We live in a 1958 house, brown enamel appliances and knotty pine cabinets and banana-colored\u00a0formica and all, and a couple of weeks ago, the tiny, squeaky-doored Hotpoint oven up and died. No warning! Just when we had finally put aside our differences &#8211;\u00a0<i>you say you\u2019re 400 degrees, I say you\u2019re 350<\/i>\u00a0&#8211; and reached an understanding! \u00a0There won\u2019t be cash for a proper renovation for a while yet, so Brandon went out last week and found a cheap used oven to temporarily replace it. And now we\u2019re\u00a0waiting for the Sears guy to come install it, because if we did it ourselves, it would all end\u00a0in a sudden flash of light and a cloud of smoke, and I do not mean to imply that there would be wizardry involved.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, there is no cake, but there are apricots poached in riesling and vanilla bean. (Which were supposed to be\u00a0<i>baked<\/i> in riesling and vanilla bean, but blah blah blah\u00a0<i>BLAH<\/i>.)<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/1f648-apssquare-psagain1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/1f648-apssquare-psagain1.jpg?w=285\" alt=\"\" width=\"473\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s probably\u00a0too late in the summer to talk about apricots? Let\u2019s do it anyway. I\u2019ve made these apricots three times already this year, and I\u2019m not ready to stop. I just made them a fourth time tonight. \u00a0The recipe is a twist on two others: Nigel Slater\u2019s Baked Apricots with Lemon Tea, from <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/books\/dp\/0007325215\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Tender, Volume II<\/a><\/i> (also known as <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ripe-Cook-Orchard-Nigel-Slater\/dp\/1607743329\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Ripe<\/a><\/i>) and my friend Jess\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sweetamandine.com\/2012\/07\/hello-my-baby-apricots.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sugared Apricots with Cardamom Pistachios<\/a>. Nigel\u2019s, if I may refer to him on a buddy-buddy first-name basis, calls for baking apricots in sweetened lemon verbena tea with star anise and a vanilla bean, and Jess\u2019s calls for dredging them in sugar before baking them in white wine and serving them with cardamom-dusted pistachios. I took one recipe in each hand and banged them together, and <i>ta da<\/i>, I give you Soft Apricots with Riesling and Vanilla Bean.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the gist: take seven or eight fresh apricots, cut them in half, and press their cut sides into a saucer of sugar. It doesn\u2019t take much &#8211; just a couple of tablespoons, and you could use even less, if you prefer. Then arrange the apricot halves in a baking dish if you\u2019re baking them, or in a skillet if you\u2019re poaching them, and tuck a split vanilla bean in there, too. Pour in a good splash of riesling. Then slide them into a hot oven, or set them over a low flame, and let them stay there until their color deepens to the orange of a very good egg yolk, their flesh gets velvety, and if you pick one up in your hand, it feels heavy, slack, almost jiggly, like a slightly tired water balloon. You could eat them warm, but I like them very cold, with a spoonful of their winey syrup.<\/p>\n<p>I first made apricots this way last summer, and though I didn\u2019t write down the method or bookmark the recipes, when this summer came around, I remembered it, sort of, and after a couple of go-rounds and tweaks, I feel confident about sharing it. I think it might be my absolute favorite thing to do with apricots, which is saying a lot, but I\u2019m going to go ahead and write that down before I second-guess it. Either way, I\u2019m posting this not only for you, but also to record the method for myself, so that next summer, I\u2019ll be able to find it without scratching my head. And then maybe I\u2019ll be able to make it five or six times, instead of only four.<\/p>\n<p>P.S. \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.kcrw.com\/etc\/programs\/sg\/sg130711henry_and_jane\" target=\"_blank\">This<\/a>\u00a0will simultaneously destroy you and rebuild you (via\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.youngnapark.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Youngna Park<\/a>). \u00a0Thank god for radio.<br \/>\nP.P.S.

Press the apricot halves, cut side down, into the sugar: each one should wind up with a nice sugar crust on one side. Arrange the apricots, skin side down, in a baking dish that will comfortably hold them all in a single layer. Scrape the vanilla seeds into the baking dish &#8211; don\u2019t worry if they clump &#8211; and wiggle the vanilla bean down between the apricots. Pour the riesling into the dish, taking care to pour it between the apricots, so that you don\u2019t wash away the sugar.<\/p>\n<p>Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the apricots are tender. [Alternatively, you can do this all on the stove, placing the apricots in a large skillet with a lid and cooking them very gently over very low heat, covered, for 35 to 40 minutes.] Sometimes they start to fall apart, and that\u2019s okay, but I like them best when they maintain their shape and barely resist the fork. Allow them to cool, and then carefully layer them in a jar, and pour the syrupy juices over the top. Chill thoroughly. \u00a0They\u2019re best eaten icy cold, and as long as they\u2019re covered in syrup, they\u2019ll keep for more than a week.<\/p>\n<p>Serve the apricots with a drizzle of their vanilla-flecked syrup, or with a scoop of ice cream (salted caramel is very good) or a spoonful of plain yogurt.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: many tiny snacks or breakfasts, or dessert for 4 people<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I just sat down, looked at the calendar, and noticed that it\u2019s August 9th.
