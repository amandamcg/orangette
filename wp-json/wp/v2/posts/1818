This morning\u2019s edition of <a href=\"http:\/\/writersalmanac.publicradio.org\/\">The Writer\u2019s Almanac <\/a>with Garrison Keillor quite nearly destroyed me.

Robert often called Elizabeth \u2018my little Portuguese\u2019 because of her dark complexion. In 1850 she published her most famous work, a collection of poems called <em>Sonnets from the Portuguese<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>On the morning of June 29, 1861, <strong>as Elizabeth lay dying, Robert fed her jelly with a spoon<\/strong>. A short time later, she died in his arms.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>2. Kate came over last night to celebrate her completion of the GMAT obstacle course. We traipsed down to the Whole for a bottle of wine, a half pint of whipping cream, and some Ni\u00e7oise olives\u2014a very promising trio. We were giggly and carried on like catty middle-schoolers. Generally our first half-hour together is like this, with both of us incapable of letting the other finish a sentence. As we stood in line to pay for our groceries, Kate pointed out a woman and her young daughter, the latter pushing a tiny shopping cart with a white flag that read, \u201c<strong>Customer in Training<\/strong>.\u201d This a strange, twisted concept. Kate suggested an alternative flag: \u201cI\u2019m very small, but I already want to spend money.\u201d We came home for an early-fall meal: the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/tg\/detail\/-\/0393020436\/qid=1095485704\/sr=8-1\/ref=pd_csp_1\/104-6327697-7819908?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846\">Zuni Caf\u00e9 Cookbook<\/a>&#8216;s warm roast-chicken salad with peppers, pine nuts, olives, and bitter greens; roasted acorn squash from the farmers\u2019 market; and the defrosted dregs of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/08\/and-then-cake-came-forth.html\">an insane chocolate cake<\/a> with floppy crowns of whipped cream. We also said the surname \u201cPutin\u201d over and over for its comic effect, and I made Kate sleepy with anecdotes from Russian history.<\/p>\n<p>3. Seattle legend and wild-haired Pilates partner Vincent gave me a ride home from class yesterday morning in his big bouncy truck. Along the way he shared with me his Buddhist-derived concept of \u201c<strong>special hells<\/strong>,\u201d citing as an example the special hell for people who never use turn signals. These sorts of flagrant sinners are banished forever to a large room filled with people. This room has two doors, one on either side, and everyone in the room walks in straight lines but can turn, without warning, at any time. The sinner must continually attempt to cross this room, from door A to door B. If he or she so much as touches one of the many people milling haphazardly about, the sinner must go back to door A. Vince, thanks for the ride.<\/p>\n<p>4. Rebecca has hung an enormous graffiti-covered canvas on the wall at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ppnwseattle.com\/\">Pilates Powerhouse NW<\/a>. After a few minutes of puzzlement and neck-craning, I decided that its big squatty block letters read \u201c<strong>Stay mean<\/strong>,\u201d an interpretation I liked immensely. I was corrected, however: it apparently says \u201cLife\u201d and was signed by a graffiti gang called \u201cBy Any Means.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I love this story. Rebecca\u2019s former hairdresser is married to a breakdancer who is in with the aforementioned graffiti gang. About six years ago, Rebecca and her husband John decided that they wanted a graffiti wall in their condo, so they invited over the breakdancer and his crew and commissioned three murals, offering guidance by telling them, \u201cWe love the Seattle skyline, the Sonics, (our gay husband) Jimmy, our garden, and drinking beer.\u201d Thus \u201cLife\u201d was born\u2014although, Rebecca says, it\u2019s not their favorite of the three. This story, which I have condensed dramatically and with great reluctance, also includes: a restaurant called Thai Ho; an elaborate description of noodles; a very sleepy, hard-partying lesbian couple; a wedding officiated by Dan Savage at the Crocodile; and an invitation to a party. The whole was concluded by Rebecca\u2019s exclamation, \u201c<strong>It\u2019s a delight to be me<\/strong>.\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/08\/oh-seattle.html\">I nodded my agreement<\/a>, breathless.<\/p>\n<p>We live in a city of dreams.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1.
