I must gorge myself on these while I still can, before fall arrives with its tomato-killing chills. I never get tired of drippy tomato-and-mayo sandwiches. I am so boring and happy.<\/p>\n<p>But then things went downhill. After lunch I set to work putting the finishing touches on my birthday cake, unfortunately destroying my chocolate ganache in the process. My forays into baking are not usually <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/08\/i-took-deep-breaths.html\">so dramatic<\/a>, I assure you. I\u2019m not used to these feelings of panic and betrayal in the kitchen.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s ganache episode I unknowingly overheated the heavy cream, and the chocolate, when added, proceeded to separate into little bumpy grains and puddles of slippery oily sludge. Most inconveniently, it waited to <em>really<\/em> do this until after I\u2019d already begun pouring and spreading it over my <strong>two-tiered dark chocolate and raspberry cake<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"407\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/09\/Nasty-ganache.11.jpg\" width=\"418\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I carried on, terrified, working my icing spatula with a fool\u2019s determination. Once the entire thing was covered with my broken ganache, I called my mother and left a frantic message about being afraid of my birthday cake. She didn\u2019t call back.<\/p>\n<p>I will spare you the ugly details, but I <em>did <\/em>manage to salvage the cake and the ganache with a combination of desperation, very dirty fingers, and aggressive spatula action. My cake looks smooth, modern, and architectural, with dull spackle-like frosting.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"403\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/09\/Architectural-cake.11.jpg\" width=\"417\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And now I\u2019m afraid that the El Rey bittersweet chocolate I used may be too bitter for my comrades in tonight\u2019s birthday festivities.
