A few years ago, I went through <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2009\/04\/its-name-is-farro.html\" target=\"_blank\">a period of cooking it regularly<\/a>, but then I forgot about it. I\u2019m good at that. Farro went the way of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2009\/01\/calls-for-cake.html\" target=\"_blank\">this apple cake<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2011\/01\/yes-already.html\" target=\"_blank\">these oatmeal popovers<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2011\/05\/pile-it-on.html\" target=\"_blank\">this egg salad<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2009\/02\/now-you-know.html\" target=\"_blank\">this broccoli soup<\/a>,\u00a0and <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/10\/pleasantly-sogged.html\" target=\"_blank\">this boiled kale<\/a>, foods that I love but almost never think to eat. But: yesterday I bought farro for the third time in less than a month. The third time! LOOK OUT.<\/p>\n<p>A billion (or five and a half) years ago, when Brandon and I got married, one of the dishes that <a href=\"http:\/\/ciaothyme.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">our caterer<\/a>\u00a0made for the reception was farro with caramelized onions, carrots, celery, and feta, with a red wine vinaigrette. I didn\u2019t have much experience with farro, but I liked the sound of it when they suggested it, and it was, in fact, terrific: chewy, nutty, and complex. In its uncooked state, it looks a little like barley, and once cooked, it looks a lot like brown rice, but its flavor is more interesting and lighter somehow than either.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4422a-photo281.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4422a-photo281.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>For the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been cooking big batches of farro and stashing it in the fridge, scooping out a few spoonfuls at lunch or dinner as the base for a hearty salad. I\u2019ll bet a lot of you do this, too, with some grain or other?\u00a0At first, I threw in whatever I found in the crisper drawer and any leftovers that were lying around, but slowly, over a number of days, I settled on a few ingredients that got along especially well. The flavors in my salad are not unlike the farro salad from our wedding, but mine is quicker to make, more of a bang-it-together thing.\u00a0I\u2019ve been sitting on this post for a while, wondering if this recipe &#8211; if you can even call it a recipe &#8211; was too simple to write about, but then I decided that if I like it enough to eat it a few times a week, well, you know, what the hell, why not.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s call it a warm farro salad with chickpeas, feta, and spicy dressing. \u00a0You\u2019ll need a good-sized bowl &#8211; maybe the kind they call a pasta bowl?\u00a0\u00a0I use a medium-sized mixing bowl, because I\u2019m a classy lady. Whatever you\u2019re using, put a nice amount of warm farro in the bottom of it,\u00a0and then pile on a spoonful of chickpeas, maybe half of a sliced carrot, a handful each of chopped escarole and radicchio, and a generous hunk of feta, crumbled. You could also add some small pieces of cooked chicken, if you want, or leftover steak or braised pork, and other raw or roasted vegetables. Everything is negotiable, except the feta. DO NOT SKIP THE FETA. Then you douse your salad with a dressing that\u2019s essentially <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/N%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bc_ch%E1%BA%A5m\" target=\"_blank\">nuoc cham<\/a>: fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, water, garlic, and a chile. You are now ready to sit down with your mixing bowl and eat. \u00a0There\u2019s something very special, I think, about the union of farro and feta, and then the chickpeas, the bitter chicories, the sweet carrots, and the salty-hot dressing: it\u2019s crunchy and juicy, now warm, now cold. It was my dinner yesterday and my lunch the day before, and if I\u2019m lucky, it\u2019ll\u00a0be my dinner tonight.<\/p>\n<p>P.S. My friend and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Spilled Milk<\/a> co-host Matthew Amster-Burton has written a new book, and he\u2019s just launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund it.\u00a0It\u2019s called\u00a0<i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/1644995500\/pretty-good-number-one-an-american-family-eats-tok\" target=\"_blank\">Pretty Good Number One: An American Family Eats Tokyo<\/a><\/i>, and like everything Matthew writes, it\u2019s funny, insightful, and very smart.

I like the farro grown by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bluebirdgrainfarms.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bluebird Grain Farms<\/a>\u00a0of Winthrop, Washington. Farro should be soaked briefly before cooking, although Matthew often uses Trader Joe\u2019s quick-cooking farro \u2013 done in 10 minutes! \u2013 and says that it\u2019s great. In any case, I give instructions below for cooking standard farro, and hey, feel free to scale up and cook an even bigger batch, if you\u2019d like. From one cup of uncooked farro, I wind up with enough cooked farro for three or four servings of this salad.<\/p>\n<p>Also: among types of feta, I like French feta best.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n              <h3>For the farro:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 cup farro\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd tsp. salt\r          <\/div>\n                      <h3>For the dressing:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 Tbsp. fish sauce\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 Tbsp. lime juice\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 to 3 Tbsp.

Then drain the farro, put it back into the saucepan, and add 3 cups of cold water and \u00bd teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil; then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until tender but still a little chewy, about 45 minutes. It\u2019s up to you, really, how \u201cdone\u201d you want your farro. At 30 minutes, mine is usually too tough, but a few minutes later, it\u2019s just right: al dente, but not exhausting to chew. When it\u2019s ready, drain it, and either use it while it\u2019s warm\u00a0or transfer it to a storage container for later use. (Covered and chilled, cooked farro will keep for a few days, easy.)<\/p>\n<p>To make the dressing, combine the fish sauce, lime juice, 2 tablespoons of the brown sugar, 6 tablespoons of the water, the garlic, and chile in a small bowl. Whisk well. Taste: if it\u2019s too pungent, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time. If you\u2019d like a little more sweetness, add more brown sugar \u00bd tablespoon at a time. (Covered and chilled, the dressing will keep for three days to a week.)<br \/>\nTo assemble a portion of salad, scoop out a couple of large spoonfuls of farro \u2013 maybe 1\/3 to \u00bd cup \u2013 and put it in a wide bowl. If the farro is cold, you might want to microwave it for 45 seconds or so, to warm it. That\u2019s what I do. Or you could put it in a small ovenproof dish, covered, and bake it for a few minutes to warm it. Or you can just leave it cold. Add a large spoonful of chickpeas, a good handful each of escarole and radicchio, and maybe half of a carrot, sliced. Top with a generous amount of feta, and then drizzle some dressing \u2013 maybe a tablespoon? Or to taste \u2013 over the whole thing. Toss, and eat.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the time since we last spoke, I\u2019ve revised the manuscript for my next book!
