His first novel <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0060790598\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060790598&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=77DWIEM6CVVEKQWT\" target=\"_blank\">The Mysteries of Pittsburgh<\/a><\/i> has been my favorite book for two decades, since I first read it at sixteen years old. He also wrote <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0812983580\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0812983580&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=VKT5VXTQ23DU6W2W\" target=\"_blank\">The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay<\/a><\/i>, which won a Pulitzer Prize, and plenty more since that. I finally got around to starting <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0812979214\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0812979214&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=XWT6LGAPNR4VKDKP\" target=\"_blank\">Wonder Boys<\/a><\/i>, his second novel, and I like it so much that it\u2019s taken me almost a month to get through only the first two hundred pages, because I want to read and reread every sentence over and over and over, just sort of roll myself around in it. For example, this: &#8220;&#8216;Is he kidding?&#8217; said Miss Sloviak, all of whose makeup seemed in the course of the ride from the airport to have been reapplied, very roughly, an inch to the left of her eyes and lips, so that her face had a blurred, double-exposed appearance.&#8221; I MEAN.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Also, This American Life is killing it. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thisamericanlife.org\/radio-archives\/episode\/549\/amateur-hour\" target=\"_blank\">Amateur Hour<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Also, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/programs\/invisibilia\/\" target=\"_blank\">Invisibilia<\/a>. They\u2019ve only made a handful of episodes, so you can catch up quickly, and you should. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/programs\/invisibilia\/375927143\/the-secret-history-of-thoughts?showDate=2015-01-09\" target=\"_blank\">The Secret History of Thoughts<\/a> is fascinating, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/programs\/invisibilia\/377515477\/fearless?showDate=2015-01-16\" target=\"_blank\">Fearless<\/a>, too. (I particularly like the idea that fear = thinking + time, and that if you take away either one, and you can\u2019t have fear.) Good stuff.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Speaking of fear, ha ha HA, I\u2019m helping to lead a class called &#8220;Varying Your Voice: A Workshop on Writing in the First, Second, and Third Person&#8221; at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iacp.com\/attend\/category\/2015_conference\" target=\"_blank\">IACP conference<\/a> in Washington, DC, on Monday, March 30th.

They\u2019re not exactly winter food, but we\u2019ve been eating them every day, in salads (usually with a mustard vinaigrette and feta) or on their own, as a snack. Our family of three took down six of them at lunch today.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; It\u2019s handy that we\u2019ve been eating so many cucumbers, because when we\u2019re not eating cucumbers, we&#8217;re eating cheeseburgers. Brandon spent the better part of last year testing and perfecting a wood-fired burger for <a href=\"http:\/\/essexbarseattle.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Essex<\/a> (using grass-fed beef from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skagitriverranch.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Skagit River Ranch<\/a>, with not one but <i>two <\/i>secret sauces), and he put it on the menu last October, as a Sundays-only special. But now, as of a couple of weeks ago, it\u2019s available five nights a week, Wednesday to Sunday. June pronounces it &#8220;booger,&#8221; and she eats a full half of the thing. She\u2019s an animal.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5781f-9f7a16871.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5781f-9f7a16871.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8211; I\u2019ve mentioned before that every Tuesday is <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2014\/09\/every-tuesday\/\" target=\"_blank\">Taco-&amp;-Tiki Night<\/a> at Essex, but I haven\u2019t told you what\u2019s for dessert: our own <a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/zgbL_AOD9n\/?modal=true\" target=\"_blank\">choco taco<\/a>.
