Here\u2019s what you need to know.<\/p>\n<p>My friend Renee, she who brought the salted chocolate cookies on <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2011\/12\/december-24.html\" target=\"_blank\">our crabbing trip<\/a>, owns a restaurant called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boatstreetcafe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Boat Street Caf\u00e9<\/a>. (If I\u2019m being thorough, she also co-owns <a href=\"http:\/\/thewalrusbar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Walrus and the Carpenter<\/a>.) The cookies in question are currently served at Boat Street, where I believe they keep company with a dark chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me. They\u2019re adapted from <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Tartine-Elisabeth-Prueitt\/dp\/0811851508\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\">Tartine<\/a><\/span>, from a recipe called Deluxe Double-Chocolate Cookies, which calls for <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">half a pound<\/span> of melted bittersweet chocolate. HALF. A. POUND. Plus cocoa. The original version of the recipe is a drop cookie, but Renee and her cooks make theirs a slice-and-bake, which looks a little more elegant. And before slicing, they roll the log of dough in sugar, so that the cookies wind up looking like they\u2019re wearing sequined collars &#8211; which, now that I\u2019ve typed that out, sounds exceedingly twee, but it feels nice when it crackles between your teeth. They also add a pinch of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maldonsalt.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">Maldon salt<\/a>, just a few flakes, to the top of each unbaked cookie. It\u2019s not a lot, but it\u2019s what makes the cookie work. It wakes it up.<\/p>\n<p>What I\u2019ve been wanting to say for the past half hour, actually, is that these cookies taste the way I always wish brownies would. Because <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">that<\/span>, that right there, is what you need to know.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/1a429-6681725237_2c2eb3105b_b1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5696541382253152130\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/1a429-6681725237_2c2eb3105b_b1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now, lest you spend a lot of time comparing the photographs above with the photograph of the cookies in my last post, I should tell you that my cookies didn\u2019t turn out exactly like Renee\u2019s. I don\u2019t know why, but mine are thinner and softer. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, but hers had a sandy, shortbread-ish quality, I seem to remember &#8211; unless I was going after them like a real <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2cEPydnb0Ns\" target=\"_blank\">animal<\/a> and accidentally ate some of the beach? I can\u2019t figure it out. Brandon told me yesterday that he also suspects that Renee adds some chopped chocolate to the dough, which is a great idea. I\u2019ll try that next time. Either way, I am not complaining.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Salted Chocolate Cookies<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\"> Adapted from <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Tartine-Elisabeth-Prueitt\/dp\/0811851508\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\">Tartine<\/a><\/span>, by Elisabeth M.

Whatever brand of chocolate you choose, make sure you love it, because that\u2019s what the finished cookies will taste like. 70% cacao is ideal, but anything above 60% will do the job. And if you can\u2019t find Maldon salt, a coarse sea salt will probably be just fine.<\/p>\n<p>At Boat Street, they make these cookies quite small, about 1 \u00bd inches across. At home, I made half of the dough into small cookies, and I made the other half into more normal-sized ones, about 2 \u00bc to 2 \u00bd inches across. I think I prefer the latter. In any case, if you want small cookies, divide your dough into four portions, and shape each portion into a skinny log, about an inch in diameter. For larger cookies, shape your dough into two logs, each about 1 \u00bd-inches in diameter. Whichever way, you\u2019ll wind up with a lot of cookies. I forgot to count them before we started eating them, so I don\u2019t have an accurate yield size for you. Sorry! But really, you\u2019ll have a LOT.<\/p>\n<p>Last, note that this dough tastes best &#8211; and is easiest to work with &#8211; when it\u2019s been allowed to rest in the fridge for a day or so before baking.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            225 grams (8 ounces) bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            155 grams (1 \u00bc cups) all-purpose flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            50 grams (\u00bd cup plus 2 Tbsp.) unsweetened cocoa powder\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tsp. baking powder\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            115 grams (8 Tbsp.) unsalted butter, at room temperature\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            225 grams (1 cup plus 2 Tbsp.) sugar, plus more for rolling the logs\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 large eggs\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bc tsp. table salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tsp. vanilla extract\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            75 ml (1\/3 cup) whole milk\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Maldon salt, for finishing          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Pour water into a saucepan to a depth of about 2 inches. Bring to a simmer. Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl that will rest securely on the rim of the saucepan, and place it over \u2013 not touching \u2013 the simmering water. (Make sure that the bowl is completely dry before putting the chocolate into it, and take care that no moisture gets into the chocolate. Moisture will cause it to seize.) Heat, stirring occasionally, just until the chocolate melts and is smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, and baking powder. Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until creamy. Slowly add the sugar, and continue to beat until the mixture is completely smooth and soft, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Beat in the salt and the vanilla, and then add the melted chocolate, beating to incorporate. Add the milk, and beat until combined. Finally, add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until just incorporated. The dough will be quite thick and stiff.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on what size cookie you\u2019d like to wind up with (see headnote, above), divide the dough into 2 or 4 portions. Put each portion on a large piece of plastic wrap, and shape into a log, using the wrap to help you smoosh, roll, and smooth it. Twist the ends to seal. Chill overnight. (If you\u2019re into advance planning, the dough can probably be kept in the fridge for at least a week, or frozen for longer keeping.)<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<\/p>\n<p>Put another sheet of parchment paper on your work surface. Take a spoonful or two of sugar, and pour it onto the parchment, making a ridge of sugar of approximately the same length as your dough logs. Remove a log from the fridge, unwrap it, and roll in the sugar to evenly coat. Using a thin, sharp knife, slice the dough into \u00bc- to 1\/3-inch slices. (If you\u2019re making small cookies, the 1\/3-inch thickness is best.) Lay the slices on the baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between each cookie. Sprinkle each cookie with a few flakes of Maldon salt.<\/p>\n<p>Bake for 10 minutes, or until the top of the cookies looks set but still feels a little soft to the touch. Transfer to a wire rack, and leave the cookies on the pan to cool. Repeat with remaining dough.<\/p>\n<p>Note: These cookies will keep at room temperature for several days.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: a lot<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am writing to you today with a wool scarf wound around my entire upper body and a wool blanket tied at my waist.
