I could almost hear him sigh wistfully on the other side of the computer screen.<\/p>\n<p>Doron isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s been eating, sleeping, and breathing all things kitchen. I\u2019ve been known to have dreams involving roasted-onion tarts, platefuls of oatmeal chocolate-chip cookies, and butter-rich cakes stacked like gold bullion. <strong>I wake up breathless, touching my belly like a private eye looking for evidence<\/strong>, whispering, \u201cThank GOD I didn\u2019t actually eat all that. Phew!\u201d And coincidentally, the very same night that Doron unleashed his subconscious upon a kitchen supply store, I was dreaming of <strong>a fried chicken sandwich<\/strong>. In my dream, I was somewhere trying on a pair of pants, when I found myself suddenly before a deli counter of sorts. Facing me was a round, genial man in overalls. I somehow knew that the place was known for its fried chicken sandwiches, but I hesitated, unsure. The man smiled at me, gestured over his shoulder with a ruddy thumb, and drawled, \u201cI got <strong>a whole messa chickens fried up in back<\/strong>. You gotta have a sanwich.\u201d So I ordered one, and then I went back to incongruously trying on my pants, wondering whether my sandwich would come with coleslaw. Unfortunately\u2014and as is always the case\u2014I woke up before I could find out.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are the times when all this eating, sleeping, and breathing paradoxically causes loss of sleep. Take, for example, the Sunday before last, when <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/01\/on-industry-indolence-and-italian.html\">Kate<\/a> sacrificed sleep and sanity to rise at six in the morning and bake <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/11\/on-self-sufficiency-and-sourdough.html\">sourdough boules<\/a> before sunrise with a wifebeater and a copy of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thestranger.com\/current\/\"><em>The Stranger<\/em><\/a>\u2014and this only a few days after she, in a fit of insomnia, read <strong>an entire hors d\u2019oeuvres cookbook in the middle of night<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>And of course there\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/08\/i-took-deep-breaths.html\"><strong>my strawberry problem<\/strong><\/a><strong>, a late-night leitmotif<\/strong> since last June, when I giddily crammed 10+ pounds of freshly picked and washed strawberries into my freezer, blissfully unaware of the slumber they\u2019d steal. Yes, dear reader, I\u2019m <em>still<\/em> working my way through the berries, and I\u2019m <em>still<\/em> lying awake at night, wondering what to do with them next. After all, before we know it, summer will be upon us again, with more fields of berries to be picked! As I said, this is serious. So thank goodness for old standbys, pinch hitters when the (alarm) clock is ticking.<\/p>\n<p><strong>G\u00e2teau au Yaourt \u00e0 la Fraise, or French-Style Yogurt Cake with Strawberries<\/strong><br \/>Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fnac.com\/Shelf\/article.asp?OrderInSession=1&amp;Mn=1&amp;SID=bbe8275e-c642-d801-09e2-6c6b9b109514&amp;TTL=291020040636&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;Origin=FnacAff&amp;PRID=1275717&amp;Ra=-1&amp;To=0&amp;Nu=1&amp;UID=0845835eb-a89d-ebc2-bc9a-10e3422c9b03&amp;Fr=-1\"><em>G\u00e2teaux de Mamie<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/02\/Strawberry-cake-close-up.jpg\" height=\"480\" width=\"414\"><\/p>\n<p>This cake is another slight variation on the <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/08\/slow-roasting.html\">yogurt cake<\/a> I wrote about last August, a fantastically easy one-bowl French invention. Strawberries will be woefully out of season for another few months, but take heart: this recipe works beautifully with frozen fruit. The cake rises tall in the pan, and the strawberries collapse onto themselves, leaving moist, jammy pockets. The result has a light, moist, not-too-sweet crumb\u2014perfect with coffee in late afternoon or with a melty scoop of ice cream after dinner. It tastes like June, like things to come.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note<\/em>: If you don&#8217;t have a little individual-size yogurt jar from France\u2014and we can&#8217;t<em> all<\/em> have them\u2014know that 1 jar equals 125 ml, or a touch over 1\/2 cup.<\/p>\n<p>1 jar plain yogurt (I like Brown Cow brand, either Cream Top or nonfat)<br \/>2 jars sugar (I like to use raw cane sugar, or a mixture of white and brown sugars)<br \/>3 eggs<br \/>2 jars unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>1 jar finely ground blanched almonds (a Cuisinart does a fine job, but be careful not to turn your almonds into almond butter; you&#8217;re aiming for a powdery texture)<br \/>2 tsp baking powder<br \/>1 jar canola oil<br \/>Frozen (quartered or halved, depending on their size) strawberries<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease an 8-inch round cake pan with butter or cooking spray.<\/p>\n<p>In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, sugar, and eggs, stirring until well blended. Add the flour, ground almonds, and baking powder, mixing just to combine. Add the oil, stirring to incorporate. Pour about 2\/3 of the batter into the prepared pan, and distribute frozen strawberries\u2014about two handfuls\u2014evenly over the batter. Pour the remaining batter over the berries, trying to cover them as well as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Bake for 40-50 minutes, until the cake feels springy to the touch and a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. [Because you\u2019ve put frozen fruit into the cake, it may take a bit longer, depending on your oven. If, after thirty or so minutes, the cake is browning too quickly, you may need to tent it with foil.]<\/p>\n<p>Cool cake on a rack for about 20 minutes; then turn it out of the pan to cool completely. Cut into wedges and eat with satisfaction, watching your freezer slowly empty.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is getting serious.Last week my friend Doron e-mailed to tell me about a dream he\u2019d had in which he\u2019d gone into a store and picked up \u201cany and every kitchen tool in existence.\u201d From microplane zesters to rubber spatulas, food processors, and stockpots, \u201cit was heaven,\u201d he said.
