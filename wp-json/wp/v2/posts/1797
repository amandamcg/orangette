After all, my (half-)brother David has certainly made us wait.<\/p>\n<p>David was fifteen when I was born. A mid-seventies transplant from Baltimore, <strong>he took Oklahoma City by storm with his stylish and shiny Farrah Fawcettesque hair<\/strong>, striped knee socks, and devilish ways. Although he kept himself busy scandalizing various cities and defying death and teachers, he also took care to do the requisite brotherly things: asking me (\u00e0 la Telly Savalas), <strong>\u201cWho loves ya, baby?\u201d<\/strong> and training me to say, \u201cYou do!\u201d; sitting on me and tickling me until I couldn\u2019t breathe; harassing me about boys; and giving me a beer-derived nickname, <strong>Molson<\/strong>. The <em>Kojak<\/em> game is now long over, though it was only around age fourteen that I was able to convince David that tickling is <em>not<\/em> okay. And as for the harassment, it has today happily morphed into a lively banter, at times risqu\u00e9 enough to make him flinch. He pauses, gives me a high-five, and then returns the off-color punch. And of course, I\u2019m still Molson.<\/p>\n<p>But we\u2019ve been waiting. He\u2019s not getting any younger, and Car\u00e9e is a fantastic catch, to say the least: strong, smart (a professor of health and human sexuality, complete with tabletop condom trees and penis light-switches), pretty, sophisticated, willing to tolerate David\u2019s goofiness, able to put him in his place, and well-versed in<strong> dirty martinis<\/strong>. So finally, one blustery weekend last winter, he got down on literal and proverbial bended knee and offered up a very impressive diamond. Car\u00e9e, caught straight out of the shower in a bathrobe and towel-turban, bravely accepted.<\/p>\n<p>And this past weekend, we celebrated.<\/p>\n<p>David and Car\u00e9e arrived in Oklahoma City on Thanksgiving Day with a cooler full of Malpecq oysters, which David shucked using our father\u2019s tried-and-true oyster knife. We gathered around the butcher-block island in the kitchen, <strong>Champagne flutes in hand<\/strong>, everyone but (scaredy-cat) me loudly slurping oysters. Watching David and Car\u00e9e together, I was struck by how solid he seems with her, how confident, playful, <em>happy<\/em> he is. My mother tells me that he wants to have speakers installed in the kitchen of the house he and Car\u00e9e have just bought: he wants to be able to <strong>kitchen-dance<\/strong>. It&#8217;s so beautiful.<\/p>\n<p>But all this was only a prelude: <strong>the true celebration came Saturday night<\/strong>, when forty or so of my parents\u2019 friends joined us to f\u00eate David and Car\u00e9e\u2019s engagement. David cleaned up\u2014even taking off the backwards baseball cap, his daring gang-member look\u2014to resemble the suave businessman he is, and Car\u00e9e looked gorgeous in a sleeveless, cowl-neck dress. I got to play hostess (a talent I prize but use far too infrequently) and managed to work the crowd for over two hours without getting a face ache from too much smiling. But best of all, <strong>there were biscuits<\/strong>\u2014sweet-potato biscuits.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/12\/Sweet-potato-biscuits1.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For as long as I can remember, we\u2019ve had sweet-potato biscuits with ham and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnnysfinefoods.com\/shop\/product.aspx?categoryID=10&amp;productSKU=05020\">Honeycup mustard<\/a> (\u201cUniquely sharp!\u201d the label warns) on the party rotation. For this particular occasion, Mom did a bit of research and found, via <a href=\"http:\/\/davidrosengarten.com\/\">David Rosengarten<\/a>, what is purported to be <strong>the finest ham in all of America<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/msbsbbq.com\/default.asp?page=913\">Murcer\u2019s bone-in ham<\/a> from Enid, Oklahoma. It was indeed a lovely, honey-tinged, and luminously rosy specimen, redolent of smoke, its aroma wafting up from the kitchen into my father\u2019s bathroom, where I was prettifying for the evening\u2019s festivities. Paired with a <strong>generous slathering<\/strong> of Honeycup mustard on a <strong>buttery<\/strong> sweet-potato biscuit, it was intoxicating. The bartender also kept my wine glass very full.<\/p>\n<p>Faithful readers may have noticed that I\u2019ve been talking <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/11\/gloom-doom-and-biscuits.html\">biscuits<\/a> a lot lately, but with winter\u2019s cold closing in and many dark months ahead, consider all this buttery richness a pre-emptive strike against hypothermia. As my French host-father used to say, <em><strong>\u201cC\u2019est nourrissant!\u201d<\/strong><\/em> So <em>allez, mangez<\/em>: come spring, you\u2019ll thank me. Car\u00e9e, with wedding-dress fittings no doubt menacing, will not.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations, you two.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sweet-Potato Biscuits<\/strong><br \/>(Adapted slightly from <a href=\"http:\/\/marthastewart.com\/\">Martha Stewart<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>1 3\/4 cups all-purpose flour<br \/>2 Tbs light-brown sugar<br \/>2 1\/2 tsp baking powder<br \/>1 tsp salt<br \/>1\/2 tsp baking soda<br \/>6 Tbs chilled unsalted butter<br \/>3\/4 cup chilled sweet potato puree (read: peeled, boiled, and pureed sweet potatoes)<br \/>1\/3 cup buttermilk<\/p>\n<p>To make the dough:<br \/>In a large bowl, whisk together 1 3\/4 cups all-purpose flour, 2 Tbs light-brown sugar, 2 1\/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, and 1\/2 tsp baking soda. With a pastry blender or two knives (or not-too-warm fingers), cut in 6 Tbs chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces, until mixture resembles coarse meal, with some pea-size lumps of butter remaining. In a small bowl, whisk together 3\/4 cup chilled sweet potato pur\u00e9e and 1\/3 cup buttermilk; stir quickly into flour mixture until combined (do not overmix).<\/p>\n<p>To shape the biscuits:<br \/>Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface, and knead very gently until dough comes together but is still slightly lumpy, five or six times. (If dough is too sticky, work in up to 1\/4 cup additional flour.) Shape into a disk, and pat to an even 1-inch thickness. With a floured 2-inch biscuit cutter, cut out biscuits as close together as possible. Gather together scraps, and repeat to cut out more biscuits (do not reuse scraps more than once).<\/p>\n<p>Baking the biscuits:<br \/>Preheat oven to 425\u00b0, with rack on lower shelf. Butter or spray an 8-inch cake pan. Arrange biscuits snugly in pan. Brush with 1\/2 Tbs melted butter. Bake until golden, rotating once, 20 to 24 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 8 biscuits.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This Thanksgiving, the focus wasn&#8217;t on the ritual turkey and stuffing; it was on a wedding engagement.
