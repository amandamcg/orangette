Looking back at old posts is always <strong>a daunting proposition<\/strong>. Orangette came into this world with a somewhat murky focus: all I knew was that I wanted to write, and to write about food. For the past fourteen or so months, I\u2019ve written, read, reread, and thereby learned a tremendous amount about what matters to me\u2014in food, in writing, and in the everyday stuff of life\u2014and Orangette has, in turn, gradually taken on a clearer shape.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, I discovered that the posts I loved most were the ones that told stories. Isaac Bashevis Singer once said, \u201cI don\u2019t care how eloquent your phrasing. <strong>Unless you\u2019re a storyteller, you\u2019re not a writer<\/strong>.\u201d  I keep this quote taped to my desk, scribbled on a scrap of yellow paper, right underneath another snippet that reads, \u201c<strong>Let the glory out<\/strong>,\u201d from an old Al Gore, Sr. speech.  This is what I want to do, and what I want Orangette to be.<\/p>\n<p>And on the days when I think about going back to the archives and erasing the old, rambly, journal-y posts\u2014the proverbial ghosts of yore\u2014I always manage to stop myself, because I suppose I was trying to tell a story then too, and maybe even wringing out some sort of little glory, just in a rambly, journal-y way. And anyway, if I\u2019m to take a lesson from myself, <strong>blogging should be approached like baking: with lot of cussing and determination.<br \/><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week I was tagged\u2014not once, but twice\u2014for the 23rd-post-5th-sentence meme, a nifty little game that would have me dig into my archives, find my 23rd post, pull out its fifth sentence, and analyze its meaning.
