I decided against it, but during the thirty seconds when I was considering and then reconsidering, I remembered a walk I took with the dog a few weeks ago. A little boy down the street was having a birthday party, and from the skull-and-crossbones flags tied to the laurel hedge along the road, I gathered it was pirate-themed. There was some marauding role-playing going on in the yard as I passed by, lots of running and yelling, and from the other side of the hedge, I heard someone confess, &#8220;I don\u2019t like to whip her, but I really need her to run fast, because the British are coming!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Which would be alright with me, actually, because they make good plum cakes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/48889-6187070147_3b335528d3_b1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/48889-6187070147_3b335528d3_b1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"727\" height=\"544\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve written about a lot of cakes over the years, but time and time again, the ones I return to are these: everyday cakes, no frosting, no ceremony. This particular example comes from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nigelslater.com\/home.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Nigel Slater<\/a>\u2019s <a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Tender-Cooks-Guide-Fruit-Garden\/dp\/0007325215?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\">Tender, Volume II: A Cook\u2019s Guide to the Fruit Garden<\/a>, a tome if ever there was one. The thing weighs 3.8 pounds. I could probably spend a few years cooking only from <a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nigelslater.com\/tender.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Tender<\/a>, and if anyone out there is looking for a project, well, my friend, there\u2019s a whopper for you. The two volumes live on a special shelf next to my desk, and last week, that shelf was where I went when I found myself with several pounds of rapidly ripening plums from my friend Wynne at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jerzyboyz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jerzy Boyz Farm<\/a>. We buy hundreds of pounds of fruit from her every year for the restaurant, and she\u2019s taken to calling me &#8220;sweetie.&#8221; She knows what I like.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I had this box of plums, so I went to Nigel, and Nigel placed before me the words <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pudding Cake of Honey, Cinnamon, and Plums<\/span>. I think I could stop this post right here and you would know everything you need to know, but I will say just a little more, because as it turns out, this is going to be my new go-to cake. It\u2019s a cinnamon spice cake with plums, and as the name implies, it\u2019s dark and very tender &#8211; <i>damp<\/i>, as I once heard Nigella Lawson say. What\u2019s particularly interesting is that it uses three kinds of sweetener: golden syrup, honey, and brown sugar. When I was making it, I was convinced that it was going to be a toothache-inducing mess, but I can now say with confidence: DON\u2019T CHANGE A THING. The sweeteners each bring a different flavor, and together, they give the cake real depth and warmth. And the plums aren\u2019t sweetened before they get dropped into the loose, caramel-colored batter, so they retain a nice sourness as they sink and soften.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t the kind of cake that you reserve for company; it\u2019s a Tuesday-night sweet. It\u2019s also a Wednesday-afternoon, coming-in-from-the-rain sweet. It is also, if you\u2019re open to it, a totally reasonable breakfast. I don\u2019t like to use the word <i>perfect<\/i>, because I am fickle, but I\u2019ll say it here. I think this cake is perfect.<\/p>\n<p>Happy fall.<\/p>\n<p>P.S. I\u2019ve fallen in love with the ease, speed, and accuracy of metric weight measurements, particularly in baking. From now on, the recipes I post here will use both cup and weight measures.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\"> Nigel Slater\u2019s Pudding Cake of Honey, Cinnamon, and Plums<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Tender-Cooks-Guide-Fruit-Garden\/dp\/0007325215?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\">Tender, Volume II<\/a><\/span><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2011-09-27T00:04:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/517?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>My neighborhood grocery store carries <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lylesgoldensyrup.com\/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">golden syrup<\/a>, and in general, I think it\u2019s getting easier to find in the US every day.

Grease an 8- or 9-inch square baking dish, and line it with parchment paper. I like to cut the parchment so that it hangs over the edge of the pan: you can use it to help you lift the cake out later. There\u2019s no need to grease the parchment.<\/p>\n<p>In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Whisk well.<\/p>\n<p>In a saucepan, warm the golden syrup, honey, and butter over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. When the butter is melted, stir in the brown or muscovado sugar. Remove the pan from the heat, and set aside to cool for a minute or two.<\/p>\n<p>Break the eggs into a medium bowl, add the milk, and whisk to mix.<\/p>\n<p>Pour the golden syrup mixture into the flour mixture, and stir with a sturdy spoon until just combined. The batter will be very thick at this point. Pour in the egg mixture, and continue to stir \u2013 it will resist incorporation and look weird at first \u2013 until you have a loose, almost sloppy batter without any traces of flour.<\/p>\n<p>Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and then arrange the plums on top. (They will sink.) Bake for 35 minutes; then place a piece of foil loosely over the top of the cake, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes more. The cake should look mostly set at this point, but it might still look the slightest bit soft in the center. That\u2019s okay. Remove the piece of foil, turn off the oven, and leave the cake in there for another 15 minutes. Transfer to a rack. Cool for 20 minutes; then loosen the cake from the pan and lift it out onto the rack. Cool completely before slicing.<\/p>\n<p>Note: This cake keeps beautifully at room temperature, and because it\u2019s so incredibly moist, it\u2019s actually best not to cover it too tightly, or else it can get gummy. So long as you eat it within 2 or 3 days, a piece of wax paper pressed against the cut surfaces is all you really need.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 8 servings - or maybe more<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We left our window open last night, and when I woke up today, there was rain on the sill!
