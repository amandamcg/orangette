Now&#8217;s my turn, because somehow I didn&#8217;t catch those posts back in 2015 and 2016, and it took me until late 2017 to join the party, and I won&#8217;t let that to happen to anyone else. The recipe I&#8217;m talking about is a blondie from <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2xYVLdM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Violet Bakery Cookbook<\/em><\/a>, by Claire Ptak, a Californian transplant to London and owner of east London&#8217;s Violet Bakery. I&#8217;d heard of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.violetcakes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Violet<\/a> here and there, and I&#8217;ve always wanted to visit. Instead, I have the cookbook.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"662\" height=\"441\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-9931\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/F7A6807-662x441.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/F7A6807-662x441.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/F7A6807-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/F7A6807-870x580.jpg 870w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/F7A6807.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Behold the Violet Butterscotch Blondie, a very special specimen of the genre: a rich brown sugar batter, freckled with chocolate and topped with bits of homemade caramel that you&#8217;ve cooled and broken into glass-like shards. I use the word &#8220;glass&#8221; with intention: I accidentally stabbed a fingertip and drew blood. It was worth it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9937 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/F7A6828-662x441.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"662\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/F7A6828-662x441.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/F7A6828-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/F7A6828-870x580.jpg 870w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/F7A6828.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If these blondies seem too fiddly for everyday baking, maybe they are. You do have to make a caramel, albeit the most basic and quick of caramels. But a single batch of the caramel makes enough shards for <em>two<\/em> pans of blondies. I stashed my extra caramel glass in a plastic baggie in the freezer door. And then making a second batch of blondies &#8211; which I did not long after I&#8217;d made the first &#8211; was no more work than a standard chocolate chip cookie recipe. You don&#8217;t even have to remember to bring butter to room temperature, because you&#8217;re going to melt the butter anyway. The batter comes together without even a mixer, just a couple of bowls and a spoon. In the oven, it sets to a fudgy-brownie kind of texture: soft and dense, substantial enough to cut into tidy pieces, but still with a fine degree of squish.\u00a0And the caramel melts and sinks, settling into pools of concentrated butterscotch flavor, some of them chewy as candy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9930 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/F7A6796-662x441.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"662\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/F7A6796-662x441.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/F7A6796-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/F7A6796-870x580.jpg 870w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/F7A6796.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For those of you who follow me on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mollyorangette\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram<\/a>, or who follow my partner Ash, these are the blondies she posted a photo of.\u00a0 I baked them for her birthday, and I know a number of you asked about them.

Once the sugar starts to dissolve, raise the heat to medium-high &#8211; watch the pan closely and constantly! &#8211; and continue to cook until the caramel is a dark golden brown, a deep shade of walnut.<\/p>\n<p>Pour the caramel immediately onto the parchment paper in a thin, even layer. If necessary, lift and tilt the pan to coax the caramel to spread evenly. Allow to cool completely.<\/p>\n<p>Lift the parchment from the sheet pan, and place on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to cut the cooled caramel into smallish shards, ideally no bigger than a quarter. Be careful, because the caramel is hard and the shards are sharp.<\/p>\n<p>Use right away, or store leftovers in the freezer.
