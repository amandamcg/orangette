In all truth, I\u2019ve been eating variations on this supper at least twice a week for the past two months. In a show of my sickness, I\u2019ve even forced it\u2014and an evening of <em>America\u2019s Next Top Model<\/em>\u2014upon <a href=\"http:\/\/glutenfreegirl.blogspot.com\/\">Shauna<\/a>, who gamely gave both her hearty endorsement. I also dragged this salad schema to New York, where I risked my life to cross the threshold of Fairway on a Saturday afternoon for a few heads of endive and a package of feta. I may be <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/04\/on-routine-with-tears-taste-buds-and.html\">a creature of habit<\/a>, and an aggressive one at that, but I could do a lot worse, I think, than this <strong>spring slaw of sorts<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Sliced_salad_bowl.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/04\/Sliced_salad_bowl.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>A cousin of the chopped salad, this sliced version is built on <strong>a four-point foundation: endive, cilantro, radishes, and feta<\/strong>. Though not initially an intuitive combination, together their sum is much greater than its parts, especially when a good, kicky vinaigrette is involved. The bitter earthiness of endive is subdued under a smear of soft, salty feta, and the watery crunch of a wafer-thin radish borrows brightness and character from whole cilantro leaves. Anything else is unnecessary, really, but I like to add radicchio for its color and bracing bite, and avocado for its creamy, mellow quality, which smoothes, softens, and unites the separate components into a delicious, seamless whole. <strong>Elegant and yet easy to eat while watching television<\/strong>, it makes for an entire meal, satisfying to both jaw and belly. I\u2019d take this mess of sliced stuff over a simple green salad any day\u2014or, really, actually, every day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sliced Spring Salad with Endive, Cilantro, Radishes, and Feta<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Sliced_salad_top.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/04\/Sliced_salad_top.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>This salad is a study in small variations: I rarely make it the same way twice, but it never strays far from its core ingredients. Aside from the endive, cilantro, radishes, and feta, the list of ingredients below is a rough sketch. I\u2019ve been known to substitute fennel for radicchio, and occasionally I add a few nuggets of Parmigiano Reggiano, some meaty flakes of smoked trout, or even just a few canned chickpeas, drained, rinsed, and dried. The key, in any case, is the quality of the ingredients. For salads like this one, I like a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avocado.org\/avocado-facts\/hass-avocados.php\">Hass<\/a> avocado that\u2019s on the firm side of ripe: not hard, but solid, with just a hint of give\u2014the<em> potential<\/em> for softness, you could say. I buy my endive on the small-to-medium size\u2014no larger than 3 ounces each\u2014with no bruises, brown spots, or other blemishes, and I look for tight, compact heads of radicchio, each about the size of a large man\u2019s fist, with smooth, shiny leaves. I serve this salad on its own, as the center of the meal, with a hunk of crusty bread or a few roasted sweet potato \u201cfries\u201d on the side.<\/p>\n<p>1 medium Belgian endive, root end trimmed away, sliced crosswise into \u00bc-inch strips<br \/>\u00bc head radicchio, sliced as thinly as possible<br \/>2-3 red radishes, sliced into paper-thin rounds<br \/>A small handful of cilantro leaves, from about 6-8 sprigs<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/02\/bagnette-breasts-and-excuse-to-eat.html\">Red Wine-Mustard Vinaigrette<\/a>, to taste<br \/>\u00bc medium avocado, sliced into \u00bc-inch strips<br \/>1 walnut-size nub of French feta (or more), crumbled<\/p>\n<p><em>Optional additions or substitutions:<\/em><br \/>\u00bd medium fennel bulb, sliced as thinly as possible<br \/>A small handful of smoked trout, torn into bite-size pieces<br \/>A small handful of chickpeas<br \/>Parmigiano Reggiano, broken into small nubs<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, combine the endive, radicchio, radishes, and cilantro leaves. Toss with vinaigrette to taste. [I find that endive salads take a bit more dressing than plain green ones.] Add the avocado and feta.
