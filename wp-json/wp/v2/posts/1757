Last night I had the pleasure of attending my second Guest Chef Night\u2014this time in the company of fellow food blogger B (of <a href=\"http:\/\/spaces.msn.com\/members\/culinaryfool\/Blog\/cns!1pYNGy2haD1h_titL1O7uNXQ!584.entry\">Culinary Fool<\/a>), B\u2019s friend E, and my ever-faithful<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/03\/praise-for-pig.html\"> Keaton<\/a>\u2014and once again, I can\u2019t keep it to myself. Everything about FareStart just feels so <em>good<\/em> that it would be a crime not to share. Consider this a public service announcement.<\/p>\n<p>Our evening began with a tour of the bustling kitchen, where the students were hard at work in their chef\u2019s whites, plating salads and hefting deep pans of chive gnocchi. A year ago, FareStart launched its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.farestart.org\/cc.asp\">\u201cFutures Rising\u201d capital campaign<\/a> to raise money for improved facilities, and the kitchen presents a convincing case: though of moderate size, it is no-frills and in need of a facelift, not the sort of space one would expect to find churning out a remarkable <strong><em>2,500<\/em> meals per day<\/strong> (which it does, between the restaurant, catering services, and contracts with area shelters). We found the evening\u2019s guest chef, Dave Miller of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maritimebrewery.citysearch.com\/\">Jolly Roger Taproom at Maritime Pacific Brewery<\/a>, busily plating pork tenderloin, with <strong>a student at each elbow and a squeeze bottle in each hand<\/strong>. He gave us a quick tour of the evening\u2019s eclectic map-hopping menu, its dishes linked by the presence of a Maritime Pacific beer in each, and we hurried back to the equally bustling dining room to get started.<\/p>\n<p>With only a few minor quibbles, it was a very good meal.<br \/>We began somewhere between Japan and California, with a salad of organic field greens with a ginger and alt ale dressing, scattered hazelnuts, and miso-seared halibut cheeks. I have <strong>a weakness for halibut cheeks<\/strong> and their surprising richness, and these generous chunks were delicate and delicious, even if their miso glaze was a bit too sweet for my taste. [Please note the superhuman restraint required to avoid\u2014or maybe not\u2014using the term \u201c<strong>sweet cheeks<\/strong>.\u201d]<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/04\/FareStart_salad_top.jpg\" width=\"416\" \/><\/p>\n<p>For our entr\u00e9e, we moved to the Southwest with lime-seared pork tenderloin, a roasted-corn masa cake wrapped in a green pasilla chile, sweet shoestring onion rings, and a trio of beer-based sauces: Salmon Bay E.S.B. piri-piri, Bosun\u2019s Black Porter salsa negra, and Islander Pale Ale chimichurri.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/04\/FareStart_pork.jpg\" width=\"416\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It was a big, busy plate, but the pork was barely pink and perfectly done, and the masa cake was reminiscent of <strong>a stripped-down tamale,<\/strong> deeply flavored with corn. And the shoestring onions stole the show: this time, a dose of sweetness was most welcome.<\/p>\n<p>Keaton and I, doing double-time for vegetarians everywhere (including ourselves, circa a few years ago), also sampled the vegetable entr\u00e9e, squash-and-broccoli-rabe fritters with tomato-ginger jam and chive gnocchi. The fritters were rustic <strong>springtime comfort food<\/strong>\u2014a union of crispy, buttery crust and green-tasting, creamy interior.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/04\/FareStart_veggie.jpg\" width=\"415\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Things got very exciting when dessert arrived, straddling an imaginary border between New Mexico and Georgia. An <strong>roasted-peach brown-butter cake<\/strong> with buttermilk-habanero ice cream and Bosun\u2019s Black Porter molasses,<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/04\/FareStart_dessert.jpg\" width=\"417\" \/><\/p>\n<p>it was soon dubbed \u201cthe flying pie\u201d by E, after both Keaton and B accidentally shot various parts of theirs skidding across the table. That\u2019s not to say that it wasn\u2019t tasty; it was simply very architectural and a bit tough to pin down, literally and figuratively. <strong>The thin brown-butter cake was moist and rich, a wonderful foil to the sweet-tart lightly cooked peaches<\/strong>, but the habanero ice cream was a point of contention, bracingly spicy and a bit on the icy side. I choose to blame it on the freezers in the current kitchen\u2014with new facilities <em>(ahem!<\/em><em>),<\/em> I\u2019m sure that future ice creams will be nothing short of luscious.<\/p>\n<p>So I can\u2019t keep it to myself. The place was buzzing with energy, and so were we. I hope you&#8217;ll consider supporting FareStart and its students, whether it be by joining a few friends for dinner on Guest Chef Night (<strong>$19.95! Three courses!<\/strong>); volunteering as servers; making a simple donation; or perhaps even attending this weekend\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tastewashington.org\/seattle.cfm\">Taste Washington<\/a> or next month\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tasteofthenation.org\/site\/Clubs?club_id=1073&amp;pg=main\">Taste of the Nation<\/a>, two local food-and-wine events whose proceeds benefit FareStart.<br \/>And I hope you won\u2019t keep it to yourself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Back in September\u2014a lifetime ago in blog years, it seems\u2014I wrote about a Seattle nonprofit called FareStart and its weekly Guest Chef Nights, in which local chefs work with FareStart\u2019s students to produce impressive three-course meals.
