She will be nine months old on Sunday, old enough to be eating solids, but she\u2019s only vaguely interested. I\u2019m kind of glad, actually. I\u2019m happy to take it slow. We\u2019ve been giving her tastes of whatever we\u2019re eating, so long as it seems manageable for her tiny mouth, and letting her take the lead. (In these photos, she was playing with a hunk of Matt Dillon\u2019s wonderful sourdough <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thecorsonbuilding.com\/bread\/\" target=\"_blank\">bread<\/a>.)\u00a0I\u2019ve read many different takes on the subject of feeding young children, and so far, what seems to work best for our family is to not worry too much about it. I hope we can sustain that feeling. We\u2019ll\u00a0try\u00a0to make food that is reasonably good for us, and to create moments to sit down and eat that food as a family, and I trust that June\u2019s body will know what it needs and when it needs it. \u00a0Maybe I\u2019m naive. \u00a0I mean, <i>of course<\/i> I\u2019m naive. \u00a0But mostly, I hope that June will grow up thinking of food as something fun, and not as a battleground. Because as everyone knows, in any battle, the loser\u2019s\u00a0head gets eaten on buttered toast. \u00a0(Maybe I\u2019ve been watching too much <i>Game of Thrones<\/i>?)<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/34e2e-photo_11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/34e2e-photo_11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"550\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>A few nights ago, June went down at seven, like she usually does. I poured myself a glass of wine and started going through some boxes of hand-me-downs that we\u2019d picked up from friends that afternoon. A little before eight, she woke up crying. I let her go for a bit, hoping she\u2019d settle back to sleep, but when she didn\u2019t, I went into her room. I reached down in the dark and picked her up, and she burrowed her face into my shoulder and rubbed her eyes and grunted. I sat down in the rocker and held her while she continued to do her best impression of a mole in sunlight, and after a few minutes, I set her back down in the crib. She rolled onto her side and popped her thumb into her mouth, and I leaned over the railing and gave her a \u201cback tickle,\u201d the way my mother and my aunt Tina and my grandmother used to do for me, and as I looked at her in the faint light that trickled in under the blinds, I felt almost unbearably glad, like I might split right open.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/71dca-photo_21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/71dca-photo_21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"550\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Of course, there are less glad moments, like that sunny afternoon when I was feeling all lovey and we were about to take a walk, and I popped open the stroller and then turned to get June out of the car, only to find that, when June and I turned back to face said stroller, it was gone, having rolled down the driveway, careened around the corner, and overturned into the drainage ditch alongside the road.
