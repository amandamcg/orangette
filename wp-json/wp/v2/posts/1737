Whether delivering the kids to soccer, track, Little League, or soccer practice; cello, guitar, piano, or violin lessons; jazz, tap, or modern dance classes; art camp, math camp; or one of four different schools, she\u2019s on the go, and gracefully. She\u2019s doing laundry at 1 am, playing doubles tennis at 11, and meeting the bus at 3. But\u2014<strong>as you might expect, given our shared <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/04\/for-french-toast-master-on-his-76th.html\"><strong>paternal heritage<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u2014it\u2019s in the kitchen that Lisa is busiest, and most astounding<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Her shelves are stacked with cookbooks and clippings, her drawers filled with gadgets and graters. She bakes quiches and lemon cakes and clafoutis; she makes <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/06\/drawn-out-days-and-noodle-nights.html\">Chinese noodle salads<\/a>, ginger-pumpkin mousse, banana tarts, blintzes for Rosh Hashanah, and luscious Indian-style cumin chicken with buttery, onion-flecked rice. <strong>She candies orange rind and rolls her own ganache truffles.<\/strong> At midnight, when the house is quiet, she tempers dark chocolate for homemade almond bark. <strong>And by way of a miracle in time management, she keeps an organic plot\u2014a beautifully manicured one\u2014at the local community garden<\/strong> a few minutes away, where she grows snap peas and snow peas, tomatoes and blackberries, radishes, onions, lettuce, and asparagus, not to mention herbs and assorted flowers. And as luck would have it, when <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/06\/10-days-tightly-packed.html\">I stopped in to visit<\/a> a couple of weeks ago, her rhubarb was ripe for its first harvesting. Dear reader, you know <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/05\/rhubarb-better-late-than-never-and.html\">how I feel about rhubarb<\/a>; it\u2019s enough to get me downright busy in the kitchen.<\/p>\n<p>So to make the most of our brief, all-too-rare, and all-too-frenetic time together, we headed home with a handful of rosy stalks. Lisa retrieved from the shelf a cookbook that, she explained as she leafed through the glossy pages, she had bought solely for one recipe: a rhubarb meringue tart.<strong> <em>Rhubarb. Meringue. Tart. <\/em>With a few notable exceptions, no three words are better suited for each other, and that\u2019s a certifiable fact<\/strong>. So we sliced up the rhubarb, juiced an orange, and rolled out the pastry dough, and then, after Little League, a cello lesson, and a few miles on the odometer,<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/NYC_rhubarb_tart_side_adjusted_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/07\/NYC_rhubarb_tart_side_adjusted_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>we slowed down;<strong> we sat still; we scraped our plates;<\/strong> we talked; and we didn&#8217;t stop until nearly 2 in the morning. It was delicious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rhubarb Meringue Tart<\/strong><br \/>Adapted from Tamasin Day-Lewis\u2019s <em>The Art of the Tart<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Day-Lewis credits her friend and colleague Nigella Lawson with the creation of this delicate, unusual tart. It begins with a buttery shell, over which is poured a sheet of unsweetened(!) cooked rhubarb and a layer of a egg-sugar-butter batter. This base is cooked until shiny and golden, and then the tart is capped with meringue and baked until lightly browned. The result is a multi-layered tart in which the rhubarb is mellowed by the buttery crust beneath it and the sugar- and butter-rich batter atop it, and the light, sweet meringue topcoat makes a perfect foil for the puckery compote it blankets. Although the tart is best, texture-wise, about 30 to 60 minutes of the oven, it also keeps nicely and tastes surprisingly wonderful cold, straight from the fridge. Lisa and I made sure to try it both ways, as should you. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/NYC_rhubarb_tart_adjusted_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/07\/NYC_rhubarb_tart_adjusted_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\u00bd recipe Martha Stewart\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marthastewart.com\/page.jhtml?type=content&amp;id=recipe1685&amp;search=true&amp;resultNo=16\"><em>p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e<\/em><\/a>, made with fresh orange juice rather than water<br \/>2 lbs rhubarb, trimmed and chopped into roughly \u00bd-inch chunks<br \/>Juice of \u00bd an orange<br \/>2 eggs, separated<br \/>2\/3 cup plus \u00bd cup granulated sugar<br \/>2 Tbs unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>2 Tbs unsalted butter, melted<br \/>\u00bc tsp cream of tartar<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.<\/p>\n<p>Roll out the p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e to fit a 9-inch removable-bottom tart pan, and line the pan with the dough. Press a sheet of aluminum foil gently into the lined pan, and fill the well of the pan with pie weights. Place the tart pan on a baking sheet, and bake until the shell is lightly golden and set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, discard the foil and weights, and allow the tart shell to cool.<\/p>\n<p>Put the rhubarb in a medium saucepan with the orange juice and heat gently until just softened and beginning to fall apart. Remove it from the heat.<\/p>\n<p>In a small bowl, beat the egg yolks with a fork. In a medium bowl, mix 2\/3 cup sugar with the flour and melted butter. Add the yolks, and stir briefly. Place a sieve over the mouth of the bowl, and pour the cooked rhubarb into the sieve. Press the rhubarb lightly to drain off its juices, allowing them to trickle into the egg-sugar-butter-flour mixture. You should add enough rhubarb liquid to make the mixture into a smooth, runny paste. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/NYC_rhubarb_tart_sans_meringue3.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/07\/NYC_rhubarb_tart_sans_meringue1.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Put the sieved rhubarb into the tart shell, spreading it evenly.
