I&#8217;m among the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sitkafestival.org\/faculty\/\" target=\"_blank\">faculty<\/a>\u00a0for the first-ever <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sitkafestival.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sitka Arts and Science Festival<\/a>, a week of multi-disciplinary cross-pollination and collaboration dreamed up by the <a href=\"http:\/\/fineartscamp.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sitka Fine Arts Camp<\/a> and several local partners, with support from the National Endowment for the Arts.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been cool and misty almost every day, summer-in-Sitka-y. I didn\u2019t bring enough clothing for this\u00a0weather, even though, after fourteen years in the Pacific Northwest, I ought to know better. I\u2019m re-wearing what I did bring. Today is day four for these leggings, day two for this sweatshirt. I\u2019ve been wearing my cheap Uniqlo down vest, and it spits out\u00a0tiny white feathers constantly. There\u2019s always one stuck in the zipper or wedged in a seam. There have been at least a half-dozen occasions when I\u2019ve noticed, out of the corner of my eye, something floating past me on the air, and looking closely, I realize it\u2019s a feather from my vest. Out here, up here, where the purply-black ravens are everywhere strutting, hopping around, prying\u00a0into garbage cans; where I\u2019ve seen my first <a href=\"https:\/\/g.co\/kgs\/hYj04h\" target=\"_blank\">tufted puffin<\/a> in the wild(!); where the only\u00a0noise I heard upon stepping out of\u00a0the dorm this morning was the percussive shriek of a bald eagle; out here, up here, even <em>I<\/em> have sprouted feathers &#8211; and am now, apparently, molting.<\/p>\n<p>Henrietta the Copy Center Lady guards the dining hall entrance at breakfast. She sits behind a podium and keeps count of us\u00a0with a hand-held tally clicker as we walk in. The first time she and I spoke, on the first morning, she scolded me for taking my coffee cup from the dining hall: <em>How&#8217;re you gonna remember to bring that back, hmmm?<\/em> She has short peppery hair and a lined face and a full,\u00a0humped quality to her shoulders, maybe from years of\u00a0devotion to the copy machine. When I gave her the class readings to be copied, she asked if she might\u00a0keep the originals, so that she could read them herself. Of course I agreed. I almost cheered, for god&#8217;s sake. I learned yesterday that she is a volunteer, not an employee here, and that she&#8217;s been volunteering for the fine arts camp (and before that, the college that used to be on this campus) for more than twenty years. Apparently Henrietta favors a certain\u00a0special copy machine that she keeps locked away in a closet when she\u2019s not around, and everyone knows that she&#8217;s the only one allowed to use it. This morning I thought about asking to take\u00a0her picture, but I chickened out. Henrietta! I&#8217;m in love.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been working hard, though it hasn&#8217;t felt like much like work. We&#8217;ve read\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.poetryfoundation.org\/poems-and-poets\/poems\/detail\/47553\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Hass<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/29PCeEx\" target=\"_blank\">Roz Chast<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxlbXRyYW5lcG9ydGZvbGlvfGd4OjFlYjE3ODYwOGY4MDk4ZTE\" target=\"_blank\">Joan Didion<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/29SujSx\" target=\"_blank\">Jo Ann Beard<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewednesdaychef.com\/the_wednesday_chef\/2010\/09\/here-there-and-back-again.html\" target=\"_blank\">Luisa Weiss<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/29SvtNM\" target=\"_blank\">M.F.K. Fisher<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2aeaDMY\" target=\"_blank\">Truman Capote<\/a>. There are ten students in my class, all women, and they&#8217;ve written so much so fast, and so bravely.<\/p>\n<p>We started this morning, the last day of class, by reading aloud <a href=\"http:\/\/writersalmanac.publicradio.org\/index.php?date=2005\/03\/19\" target=\"_blank\">Donald Hall&#8217;s &#8220;Letter in Autumn.&#8221;<\/a> It&#8217;s a poem I first read after my dad died, when a family friend gave me the book that contains it. I have a history of crying easily, especially happy crying at weddings and at odd moments in the car, but I scared myself this morning. I could hardly see, the tears came so fast, and I had to grit my teeth to keep from doing that horrible gasp-y breathing that comes before a sob. When Eileen, the student who\u2019d been reading aloud, got to the end of the poem, I looked up from my xerox and everyone looked back at me, and I laughed and sobbed in earnest now, both at the same time. (Donald Hall: \u201cWhen Philippa weeps, \/ Allison at seven announces, \/ \u201cThe river is flowing.\u201d Indeed.) It was alarming to feel out of control, especially in my role as a teacher, but it also felt okay somehow, because it\u2019s been that kind of week. We had a good laugh about it.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve walked on the beach at low tide, learning to tell <a href=\"https:\/\/g.co\/kgs\/p39iDC\" target=\"_blank\">limpets<\/a> from <a href=\"https:\/\/g.co\/kgs\/DkSW5C\" target=\"_blank\">chitons<\/a> and various\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Buccinidae\" target=\"_blank\">whelks<\/a> from various\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Littorinidae\" target=\"_blank\">winkles<\/a> and that <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pholidae\" target=\"_blank\">gunnels<\/a> look like small eels but aren&#8217;t. We&#8217;ve eaten red huckleberries in the woods and milkshakes at Harry Race Pharmacy. We&#8217;ve identified\u00a0the squawk of ravens, half-gargle-half-washboard, and the whiny screech\u00a0of an eagle, the last creature\u00a0I would expect\u00a0to produce such a sound. We&#8217;ve talked about rising ocean temperatures and climate change with Stanford&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/rob_dunbar\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Dunbar<\/a>, to whose resonant voice\u00a0I would gladly listen for at least another week. And at dinner last night, I\u00a0received this handy tip from the artist\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/nikkimcclure.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Nikki McClure<\/a>:\u00a0if you&#8217;ve forgotten to let your butter soften before starting a baking project, and if you are a person who has breasts, you can quickly warm that butter by wedging it in your cleavage.\u00a0I now pass along this wisdom\u00a0to you, as well as\u00a0declare myself Nikki McClure&#8217;s Number One Fan.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9648 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/F7A6691-662x441.jpg\" alt=\"_F7A6691\" width=\"662\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/F7A6691-662x441.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/F7A6691-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/F7A6691-870x580.jpg 870w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/F7A6691.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>None of this, of course, has anything to do with banana bread.

Continue beating until the mixture is light, fluffy, and the color of coffee with milk. Add the beaten eggs, and continue to beat. (If the mixture looks like it&#8217;s curdling at any point, add a spoonful of the flour mixture.) Add the chocolate and the mashed bananas, and beat to mix. With the mixer on low, add the flour mixture. Beat to incorporate.<\/p>\n<p>Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan, and smooth the top. Bake for about 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out moist but clean. If there is any sign of wet batter, continue baking for a few more minutes, tenting the top with foil if it&#8217;s browning too much.<\/p>\n<p>Cool the finished loaf in the pan for 15 minutes. Loosen the sides with a thin knife, then carefully lift out the loaf with the parchment liner. Cool completely before slicing.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 1 loaf<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today I come to you from Sitka, Alaska, where I&#8217;ve been since last Saturday, leading\u00a0a writing workshop on memoir and place.
