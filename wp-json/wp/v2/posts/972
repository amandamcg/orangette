You could probably see it more clearly, actually, than I could. I have never, ever, done something as consuming as this <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2009\/04\/i-get-glimpse.html\">opening-a-restaurant<\/a> business. Even writing a book doesn\u2019t compare. People had warned us that projects like these always take twice as long and cost twice as much as you expect them to, and dude, that is Seriously. No. Joke. It\u2019s been like <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Little_Shop_of_Horrors_%28film\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Little Shop of Horrors<\/span><\/a> over here, only the role of Audrey II, the man-eating plant, is being played by a small neighborhood restaurant called Delancey. This thing, it eats up more hours, and more cash, and more human flesh \u2013 last week\u2019s tally: 1 splinter, 1 blister, 1 army green bruise, and 3 burns \u2013 than I could have ever imagined.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is, for a while, this restaurant scared the crap out of me. I didn\u2019t want to say it in those exact words, but it did. You might remember that <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/11\/i-cant-wait.html\">when I first announced it<\/a>, I said that <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Brandon<\/span> was opening a restaurant? That\u2019s how it started. It was his idea. I was wary. My love for food has always been about home cooking, not the restaurant industry. I like the intimacy, the quiet, and the scale of home cooking. A restaurant is a different beast. It\u2019s exciting, to say the least, but it\u2019s also unrelenting. It means that you work when everyone else is playing. It means long hours, little security, and even less money. I should also mention that I\u2019ve seen a restaurant gleefully chew up and spit out one marriage and cheerfully maim a second. As far as I know, home cooking doesn\u2019t mean, or do, any of that. This is the kind of stuff that I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/657fd-54320011-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5358115248623205106\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/657fd-54320011-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1058\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nStill, I wasn\u2019t going to stand in his way. I knew how much he wanted it, and I wanted to support him. I knew that his vision for this restaurant was a humane one, more like an overgrown dinner party than a scene out of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kitchen Confidential<\/span>. I knew that this restaurant, either way, had the potential to turn our lives upside down \u2013 to take us over, really \u2013 but in the beginning, it was still pretty abstract. It was easy to brush off. It was easy to pass him power tools and Cool Ranch Doritos, and to cheer. Until it actually <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">did<\/span> take us over, and then I had a lot of thinking to do.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/9a320-535100091.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5358069064481207922\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/9a320-535100091.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1576\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nAnd what I decided, ultimately, is to stop thinking so much. Rather than fight it, or worry that the shape of our lives is changing, or what the hell are we doing, or whatever, I decided to get right in the middle of it. I decided to work in the kitchen at Delancey, full-time. I had originally thought that my involvement there would be on the periphery, that I would help plan the menu and develop desserts, and that I might be the host a couple of nights a week. But a few weeks ago, when we cooked our first practice dinner there, a thank-you for our designers and a few friends, I was in the kitchen with Brandon, making arugula salads and washing about eight million dirty dishes, and it just felt <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">right<\/span>. I was so happy to be working with my hands that way, to feed a room full of people and give them a good night. I felt like a part of the place. And it reminded me of something that Brandon said to me a few months ago, when the construction seemed like it would never end. He said that even though I couldn\u2019t see it yet, this restaurant would embody everything that matters to us. And he was right. It\u2019s all there.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/f6927-513900011.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5358099765423537170\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/f6927-513900011.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1576\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nSo I\u2019m going to be in the kitchen, manning the pantry station, when we open. That means that if you order a salad, some cured meats, some pickles, or a dessert, I\u2019m your girl. I have no lofty dreams about how long I\u2019ll be able to do it full-time &#8211; I want to keep writing, and doing both might be <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">nuts<\/span> &#8211; but it\u2019s right for right now. Things are only going to get busier around here, but it feels like a good kind of busy. I\u2019m ready for it. And I can\u2019t wait to share it with you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Well. That took a little longer than I expected.
