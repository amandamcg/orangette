Part of me says that cold soup is as close as it gets to perfect summer fare. I mean, it\u2019s only logical: so many of the season\u2019s fruits and vegetables take well to cold preparations, and anyway, <strong>there\u2019s something about a hot, steamy day that begs for a cool, quenching soup<\/strong>. But the other part of me can\u2019t <em>quite <\/em>get behind it. Sometimes savory flavors don\u2019t sit right when served cold and pur\u00e9ed: the taste doesn\u2019t seem to fit the temperature and texture. Cold soups can taste harsh and kind of squeaky in the mouth, but their flavors seem somehow muted too, without the aroma and richness of their warmer siblings. And moreover, it just feels weird to sip <strong>cold liquid from a spoon<\/strong>. Cold liquids, this part of me argues, should be sipped from a frosty glass, or maybe taken through a straw, like a milkshake. Cold soups are <em>not<\/em>, sadly, much like milkshakes.<\/p>\n<p>By this point, you can probably tell which of my two minds I usually think with. Which is why, when Brandon pointed out a recipe for a chilled carrot-ginger soup in a recent <em>Gourmet<\/em>, I nodded my approval with only mild enthusiasm. The list of ingredients sounded pretty good\u2014especially with the presence of avocado and curry\u2014but well, you know. Let\u2019s just say that I didn\u2019t exactly rush out in search of <strong>a stash of carrots<\/strong>. A week or so went peacefully by, sans cold soup, and then, on Saturday, it happened: my eye\u2014<em>cursed wandering eye!\u2014<\/em>fell upon a five-pound bag of organic carrots at Whole Foods. And what\u2019s more, it was only $2.99. Two ninety-nine, people. I was powerless.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/08\/Chilled_carrot_soup_close.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>So today I came home from work to find Brandon in the kitchen and three cups of fresh carrot juice in the blender, soon to be joined by an avocado, lime juice, ginger, and salt. They whirred together for barely a minute\u2014just enough time, say, for a girl to trade her high heels for bare feet\u2014and then dinner was ready.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/08\/Chilled_carrot_soup.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>A vivid orange, almost iridescent, this soup is <strong>one of the prettiest things<\/strong> to land atop our table this season. It is also quite stunningly delicious\u2014\u201ceven better,\u201d Brandon said in mid-mouthful, \u201cthan the sum of its parts.\u201d Silky smooth and subtly sweet, the beguilingly simple carrot base is spiced up with <strong>the zing of fresh ginger<\/strong> and a gentle kick from lime. The avocado blends in almost imperceptibly, its subtle richness serving as <strong>a sort of culinary cashmere blanket<\/strong>, I like to imagine, to soften and unite the soup\u2019s flavors. Heck, even <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">I <\/span>liked it. It\u2019s pretty perfect summer fare, I must admit\u2014no matter how many minds you have.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gingered Carrot Soup with Avocado<br \/><\/strong>Adapted from <em>Gourmet,<\/em> August 2006<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Chilled_carrot_soup_eating.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/08\/Chilled_carrot_soup_eating.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>This soup is easy, easy, easy, and it would make an elegant prelude to a dinner from the grill\u2014maybe flank steak or fish, with a few baby potatoes. [We, um, followed our soup with some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zagispizza.com\/\">garlic knots<\/a>, but that\u2019s not necessarily recommended.]  The only thing to fuss over is the carrot juice: it <em>must<\/em> be fresh, either juiced at home or bought fresh from the refrigerated section of your grocery store. Don\u2019t be tempted to grab the canned or bottled stuff. We juiced ours at home, and it took less than five minutes, so if you have a juicer, now\u2019s the time to dust it off and use it! You\u2019ll need three or four pounds of carrots to make three cups of juice.<\/p>\n<p>2 medium firm-ripe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.avocado.org\/about\/varieties.php\">Hass<\/a> avocados<br \/>3 cups fresh carrot juice (see note, above)<br \/>\u00be tsp salt<br \/>5 tsp fresh lime juice<br \/>2 tsp finely grated peeled fresh ginger<br \/>A pinch of good-tasting curry powder<br \/>Crunchy sea salt, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maldonsalt.co.uk\/\">Maldon<\/a> or fleur de sel<\/p>\n<p>Quarter the avocados; then pit and peel them.<\/p>\n<p>In a blender, pur\u00e9e 1 avocado with the carrot juice, salt, 4 tsp of the lime juice, and the ginger until very smooth.<\/p>\n<p>Cut the remaining avocado into small dice, and gently toss with the remaining teaspoon of lime juice, curry powder, and a pinch of sea salt.<\/p>\n<p>Serve the soup with a generous spoonful of the seasoned avocado dice.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: About 4 appetizer-size servings<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to cold soups, I\u2019m of two minds.
