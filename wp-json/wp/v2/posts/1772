I want it <em>all<\/em>, damn it. If life itself is the proper binge, as dearly departed Julia once said, I&#8217;ve got to make room for everything. Enter that boring \u201cm\u201d word, that thing I mentioned in the first paragraph. <strong>If I&#8217;m to be civilized and presentable, I <em>must<\/em> have my daily dark chocolate<\/strong>, but not enough to have me moaning and slumped on the floor. Not often, at least. Well, you know me. Ahem.<\/p>\n<p>The foods and recipes I feature most often on Orangette aren&#8217;t fancy or complex. I love to eat as much as the next guy, but I also love simplicity\u2014honest food that nourishes, that lets ingredients speak for themselves. <em>And<\/em> that features all five food groups. Truth be told, the majority of my meals consist of <strong>simple, unsexy staples<\/strong>: this winter it&#8217;s pungent, buttery, melting fontina on coarse bread; unruly greens braised into submission; and, of course, <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/01\/outline-of-theory-of-cabbage.html\">cabbage<\/a>, the season\u2019s princely toad. Sometimes nothing is more welcome than a sunny-side-up egg, flecked with salt and freshly ground pepper, blanketing a bowlful of <a href=\"http:\/\/amylou.blogspot.com\/2004\/10\/hello-dal-ly.html\">red lentil dal<\/a>. And lately, there\u2019s been a parade of citrus. Around here, it\u2019s an (heirloom navel) orange a day, perfumed and spicy, spraying bitter orange oil over my fingers and wrists; and after a late, loud, smoky night out, I\u2019ve been known to sneak <strong>a slathering of lemon curd on whole wheat toast before bed\u2014your typical rock \u2018n roll gourmandise<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>And this week, after so much whipped cream and whatnot, I\u2019m reaching for warm chickpea salad.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/02\/Chickpea-salad-close-up-adjusted.jpg\" width=\"415\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/01\/two-holy-trinities-failure-and-gratin.html\">Another standby from Lynne Rossetto Kasper\u2019s <em>Splendid Table Weeknight Kitchen<\/em> newsletter<\/a>, it\u2019s earthy and clean, <strong>sweet with shredded carrots and punchy with red wine vinegar<\/strong>.
