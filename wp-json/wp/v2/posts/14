The topography of Sitka felt familiar to me, because like Seattle, there\u2019s a lot of water, and beyond the water there are mountains, although the mountains near Sitka are much nearer, seemingly arm\u2019s reach away. Sitka also feels immediately more rugged, wetter and palpably wilder. In our first twenty-four hours, we spotted eight bald eagles and walked past some fresh-ish bear droppings on a trail, and I saw my first raven and then about three dozen more after that. Because of Sitka, I get to use the word <i>droppings<\/i> for the first time on this blog.

But it has a terrific bookstore in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oldharborbooks.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Old Harbor Books<\/a>, complete with a kids\u2019 reading nook where June and I could have spent all day. Behind the bookstore is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sitkabackdoor\" target=\"_blank\">Backdoor Cafe<\/a>, where we warmed up with some curried pea soup. I\u2019m still thinking about the raspberry crumble bar I bought there, and I probably will be for a while. A few doors up the street, I bought handmade soap scented with <a href=\"http:\/\/shop.wintersongsoap.com\/sitkasprucetipsoap.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Sitka spruce<\/a>\u00a0at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wintersongsoap.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">WinterSong Soap Company<\/a>.

June isn\u2019t usually into fish, but she wound up stealing most of mine. It was cute, and also not at all cute. But then a friend of Tiffany\u2019s saved the day by showing up with a frozen package of black cod tips for us to take back to Seattle.

I had hoped to see a humpback whale, but it was the wrong time of year. But at dusk on the evening of my reading, we went out onto the seawalk across from the library, and every few seconds a tiny fish would leap out of the water of the harbor, snatch a bug in mid-air, and\u00a0<i>plink\u00a0<\/i>back under the surface.\u00a0We also visited the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alaskaraptor.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Alaska Raptor Center<\/a>, where I met <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alaskaraptor.org\/product\/tootsie\/\" target=\"_blank\">this very small owl<\/a> and had a moment of spiritual communion with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alaskaraptor.org\/product\/gandalf\/\" target=\"_blank\">this other owl<\/a> and realized that I, having also nursed a low-grade obsession with <a href=\"http:\/\/tx.audubon.org\/sites\/default\/files\/photos\/great-blue-heron_rebecca-field.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">great blue herons<\/a> for several years, have finally become a real, full-on Bird Person.

On our first night in town, Tiffany took me to a poetry reading there in celebration of National Poetry Month. The poets ranged in age from maybe 8 to maybe 75, and their work was <i>so good<\/i>. It\u2019s been a long time since I read poetry regularly, or even felt connected to the idea of poetry, but the morning after the reading, I found myself thinking <a href=\"http:\/\/www.poets.org\/poetsorg\/poem\/diving-wreck\" target=\"_blank\">about<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.poetryfoundation.org\/poem\/177014\" target=\"_blank\">three<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.poetryfoundation.org\/poem\/175780\" target=\"_blank\">poems<\/a> that I loved as a teenager. There\u2019s something about poetry that reverberates differently from prose. Just thinking back to those poems, even remembering only a line or two, I felt for that instant like the exact same person I was when I first read them, twenty years ago, sitting on the floor of my bedroom in my parents\u2019 house in Oklahoma. Surely somebody must be able to explain how poetry does that. Or maybe it\u2019s better if no one can.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0dee8-_f7a53901.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0dee8-_f7a53901.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"640\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<p>On our last afternoon, the sun came out &#8211; in Sitka, as in Seattle, when the sun comes out, everyone throws down everything and rushes outside &#8211; so before heading to the airport, we drove to the south parking area of Halibut Point State Park and walked down to the beach behind it.
