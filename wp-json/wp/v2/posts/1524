When I find one that I like &#8211; for, oh, let\u2019s say, lentil soup &#8211; I have a hard time trying others in the same genre.  I <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">will<\/span>, of course, but in most cases, I would be just as happy to rest on my laurels and sit there, sipping that same lentil soup, until the end of time. This is not good behavior, I know, for someone who supposedly cares about cooking. I\u2019m supposed to be some sort of happy mad scientist, a real free spirit, some sort of kitchen sprite with a spoon and a stand mixer and a relentless sense of curiosity. Sometimes I am. But most of the time, I\u2019m not. I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m loyal, and sentimental, and when something clicks with me, I want to keep it around. That goes not only for recipes, but also for beauty products, and men.<\/p>\n<p>But about the recipes: take, for instance, my sister\u2019s Scottish scones.  I\u2019ve written about them here before &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/12\/scone-city.html\">twice<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/08\/i-took-deep-breaths.html\">actually<\/a>.  In the whole wide, nubbly world of scones, they\u2019re my very favorite.  They\u2019re the sort of thing that you\u2019d eat, I imagine, before setting out for a brisk, rousing hike in the Scottish Highlands.  Solid, tidy things, they have a dense, tight-woven crumb that tears apart into fat, flaky layers.   They bear a close resemblance to a biscuit, but more delicate and dainty, with a flavor that\u2019s more flour and less fat.  <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Scones seem to run a spectrum<\/span> these days: at one end sits the fluffy, muffinesque camp, and at the other, the sturdy, Old World, biscuit-like type.  My sister\u2019s rest delectably among the latter, which is just where I want them.  Forever.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">However<\/span>, I do have a rather fat collection of cookbooks, not to mention an ever-growing accordion file of recipe clippings, and they demand my attention every now and then.  They\u2019re very annoying that way.    You wouldn\u2019t believe how pushy they are.  They throw themselves at me.  They lie next to my bed like flat, lazy dogs.  They stretch and yawn all over my lap.  And sometimes, like yesterday, they tell me about scone recipes that aren\u2019t my sister\u2019s.  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The nerve.  <\/span>I swear.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s worse is that I listened, and liked it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/x\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/396453\/Scones_red_2-1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/01\/Scones_red_2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>This recipe isn\u2019t replacing my sister\u2019s quite yet, but that\u2019s only because I\u2019m very, very stubborn.  If my sister\u2019s scones are Scotland, these are Seattle &#8211; not only because they were developed nearby, at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.macrinabakery.com\/\">Macrina Bakery<\/a>, but also because they\u2019re decidedly New World, made for a city with a <a href=\"http:\/\/ijcai.org\/past\/ijcai-01\/Space%20Needle%201.jpg\">Space Needle<\/a>.   These <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">craggy, homespun<\/span> beauties have a thin, golden crust and a rich, cakey crumb that\u2019s a little like a muffin, but with more moxie.  A twist on the classic cream scone, they\u2019re made without eggs or butter, getting their body, richness, and flavor from a generous dose of heavy cream instead. But what sets them apart from the standard cream scone is a pair of electric beaters.  This recipe calls for cream that\u2019s been whipped to the smallest of soft peaks, yielding a dough that feels wonderfully light and airy,<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> like a cool, downy pillow<\/span>.  The dough rises and puffs as it bakes, making for an open, tender crumb and, I have to say, a totally bang-up scone.<\/p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re not yet sold, I have three more words for you: <b><i>currants<\/i><\/b> and <b><i>fennel seeds<\/i><\/b>.  They\u2019re in there too.  It\u2019s an unusual pairing, I know, but trust me: the winey, wintry currant has never had such a sweet, fresh-faced companion as the fennel seed.  And with all that cream, and that lovely crumb? These scones feel like winter and spring baked together in a convenient, hand-held shape \u2013  one that may well become the usual around here.<\/p>\n<p><b>Cream Scones with Currants and Fennel Seeds<\/b><br \/>Adapted from <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Leslie-Mackies-Macrina-Bakery-Cookbook\/dp\/1570613729\/sr=1-2\/qid=1170033048\/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2\/104-8162456-4377564?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books\">Leslie Mackie\u2019s Macrina Bakery and Caf\u00e9 Cookbook<\/a><\/i><\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know about you, but when I think of fennel seeds, my mind doesn\u2019t naturally leap to scones \u2013 nor, for that matter, to anything remotely of the sweet genre. This recipe, however, has me singing a different tune. Local baker Leslie Mackie is really onto something.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to use good, fragrant fennel seeds for this \u2013 not that bottle of stale ones (<i>ahem<\/i>) that\u2019s been sitting at the back of the spice drawer for years. I used some wild fennel seeds sent to me last fall by a certain <a href=\"http:\/\/madeater.blogspot.com\/\">cookiecrumb<\/a>, and they were <i>delicious.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>1 cup dried currants<br \/>1 tsp fennel seeds<br \/>3 \u00bd cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>\u00be cup granulated sugar<br \/>2 Tbsp. baking powder<br \/>1 tsp salt<br \/>2 \u00bd cups heavy cream, plus 1-2 Tbsp. for glazing<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and line two baking sheets with parchment paper or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/search?&amp;index=kitchen&amp;keywords=silpat&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag2=interactiveda6347-20\">silicone liners<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Place the currants in a small bowl, and cover them with warm water. Set them aside to plump for ten minutes; then drain.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in a small skillet, toast the fennel seeds over medium heat for about 1 minute, until fragrant. Pour the seeds into a small dish \u2013 if you leave them in the pan, they could burn \u2013 and set aside to cool.<\/p>\n<p>In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until thoroughly blended. Add the drained currants and fennel seeds, and stir to incorporate.<\/p>\n<p>Pour 2 \u00bd cups of the cream into a medium bowl, and beat just until it begins to hold small, soft peaks. It should not be stiff. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold half of the whipped cream into the dry ingredients, and then fold in the second half. When the dry ingredients are absorbed, turn the shaggy dough out onto a floured surface. Coat your hands well with flour, and gently work the dough \u2013 pressing and massaging and gathering, but not really kneading \u2013 into a rough ball. Do not overwork it: you want it to just come together. Press the dough into a large, thick round, and cut it in half. Form the halves into two smaller rounds, each about 1 inch thick \u2013 they need not be pretty, nor particularly even \u2013 and cut them into 6 triangles each. Gently transfer the scones onto the prepared baking sheets, and brush their tops with cream.<\/p>\n<p>Bake the scones for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through, until pale golden.  Serve warm or at room temperature.<\/p>\n<p><i>Note<\/i>: These scones &#8211; and all scones, for that matter &#8211; freeze beautifully in an airtight container or bag. Allow them to thaw to room temperature before reheating in a low oven.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 12 scones<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have this funny thing about recipes.
