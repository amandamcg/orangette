It is apparently a January thing for me: <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2011\/01\/i-am-celebrating\/\" target=\"_blank\">I last wrote about it<\/a> four years ago this month. \u00a0Until yesterday, in fact, I wasn&#8217;t going to write about this particular version, because I worry that two split pea recipes in four years is possibly too much split pea for even the most ardent split pea fan, but then I realized that I am, in fact, the most ardent of all split pea fans, and I refuse to\u00a0stay quiet about this soup. Also, I gave a pint of it to my mom yesterday evening, and she texted later\u00a0to say, &#8220;Wow! This soup is incredible! Thanks for sharing!&#8221; She also\u00a0included the kissing-face emoji, which, as you\u00a0know, is universal shorthand for <i>this soup is making\u00a0me amorous<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>I first tasted this recipe when Matthew made it for our &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/2015\/12\/24\/episode-207-leftovers\/\" target=\"_blank\">Leftovers<\/a>&#8221; episode of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Spilled Milk<\/a>, using ham left over from, I think, his family Thanksgiving. His soup was thinner that my usual recipe, though still quite creamy, and its flavor was more delicate and nuanced. My usual split pea kind of whacks its eater\u00a0over the head, in a nice\u00a0way, with smoky meat and the dark richness of dried peas. But in Matthew&#8217;s, I could taste not only the ham and peas, but also carrots, and soft hunks of potato, and even the occasional leaf of thyme. So this week, when I found myself in possession of a meaty\u00a0ham bone &#8211; Brandon bought me a ham from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skagitriverranch.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Skagit River Ranch<\/a> as a Christmas surprise! TRUE LOVE! And we glazed it with muscovado sugar and mustard and ate it with friends last weekend, and then had\u00a0a ham-fueled, cringe-inducing, two-family &#8220;Let It Go&#8221; sing-a-long-and-dance in our\u00a0living room! TRUE PARENTHOOD! &#8211; I texted Matthew for his soup recipe.<\/p>\n<p>Which, as it turns out, is actually <a href=\"http:\/\/www.food.com\/recipe\/split-pea-soup-cooks-illustrated-333665\" target=\"_blank\">Cook&#8217;s Illustrated&#8217;s soup recipe<\/a>. It is also not the quickest split pea soup recipe. It also\u00a0dirties more than one pot. But it mostly cooks itself, as soups do. You begin by simmering the ham bone with water and a few bay leaves for a couple of hours, until the meat pulls away from the bone and the stock is fragrant. Meanwhile, you cook the aromatics &#8211; carrot, celery, onion, garlic, and thyme &#8211; in a\u00a0pan\u00a0with\u00a0olive oil and butter, and you really let them take their\u00a0time, meandering\u00a0along for a good half-hour, until the vegetables are caramelized, softened and slicked with their own sugar. They then go into the ham stock &#8211; from which you&#8217;ve now retrieved the ham, incidentally, the ham which you&#8217;ve then shredded into bite-size nubs, discarding the spent bones &#8211;\u00a0along with the split peas and cubed new potatoes and that shredded ham I just mentioned. And by the time the table is set, you have a tremendous split pea soup, that unlikely thing, that ugly thing, that January thing, that perfect thing &#8211; and\u00a0you, you lucky thing, have a few <em>quarts<\/em>\u00a0of it.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Split Pea Soup<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Cook's Illustrated, via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.food.com\/recipe\/split-pea-soup-cooks-illustrated-333665\">Food.com<\/a><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2016-01-29T15:52:29-05:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9228?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n      <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            A meaty ham bone, roughly 2 \u00bd pounds (1.15 kg)\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 quarts (2.85 liters) water\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            4 bay leaves\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 pound (450 grams) split peas, about 2 \u00bd cups\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 teaspoon dried thyme\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tablespoons olive oil\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 medium onions, diced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 medium carrots, diced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 medium celery stalks, diced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tablespoon (14 grams) unsalted butter\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 medium garlic cloves, chopped\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 pinch sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 small new potatoes, diced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Freshly ground black pepper, for serving          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Put the ham, bay leaves, and water in a large stock pot or Dutch oven. Cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer, and cook until the meat is tender and pulls away from the bone, 2 to 2\u00bd hours. Remove the ham meat and bone from pot. When the ham is cool enough to handle, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Discard the\u00a0bone and any excessive fat.<\/p>\n<p>Add the split peas and thyme to the ham stock. Bring back to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer gently, uncovered, until the peas are tender but not yet dissolved, about 45 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions, carrots, and celery, and cook,\u00a0stirring frequently, until the vegetables give off some moisture, that moisture evaporates,\u00a0and the vegetables begin to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and add the butter, garlic, and sugar. Cook the vegetables, stirring frequently, until golden brown, the color of honey, about 30 to 35 minutes. Set aside.<\/p>\n<p>When the split peas are tender but not yet dissolved, add the cooked\u00a0vegetables, the potatoes, and the shredded ham to the pot. Simmer until the potatoes are tender and the peas dissolve and thicken soup to the consistency of light cream, about 20 minutes more. (Remember that the potatoes will continue to cook slightly as the soup cools down.) Taste for salt, though you won&#8217;t likely need any, since ham is salty. Serve hot, with freshly ground black pepper.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: Food.com says 6 cups, but that's wrong; both Matthew and I get nearly 4 quarts<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Split pea, the ugliest soup!
