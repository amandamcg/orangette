It was kind of an Italian riff on ratatouille, only minus the tomatoes and plus a dressing of roasted garlic, balsamic vinegar, red wine vinegar, and olive oil. I found the recipe a handful of years ago in one of my cookbooks, made it a couple of times, and loved it. I was thrilled when I thought of it again last week, because it\u2019s the perfect thing for late summer, when the market tables are piled high with shiny-skinned eggplants and peppers.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, however, when I made it this weekend, it was totally underwhelming.  Actually, it was more than underwhelming: it bordered on painful.  It was so aggressively vinegary that it singed my sinuses.  It could probably be marketed, I think, as some sort of perverse aromatherapy \u2013 a new-age alternative, maybe, to smelling salts.  I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I made it before and ate it so happily, but on this go-round, my first thought was DEAR GOD, PLEASE SAVE MY MOUTH.<\/p>\n<p>So, needless to say, I am not going to tell you any more about that today.  And I am so sorry, because this means that I have no new recipe to give you this week.  As I type this, I am sitting on the floor of the Amsterdam airport, en route to France(!) for my first travel writing assignment(!!). I will be there for the next week, eating and drinking and feverishly taking notes, pinching myself at regular intervals to make sure that I am not in fact sitting at my desk in Seattle, imagining the whole thing. I will also be hoping that my sinuses soon recover sufficiently that I can actually smell and taste again. That would be really nice.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/925b2-tomatoesinpan-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/925b2-tomatoesinpan-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5241194062094451010\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>But before I go, I would like to quickly call your attention to something that may actually be even more perfect for late summer than that eggplant salad.  It\u2019s not a<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> new <\/span>recipe, per se, but as these things go, it\u2019s only slightly used.  It\u2019s the recipe for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bonappetit.com\/magazine\/2008\/09\/pomodori_al_forno?changecurrentdate=true&amp;date=2008\/08\/05\">pomodori al forno<\/a> that ran with my column in the September issue of <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Bon App\u00e9tit<\/span>. I\u2019ve been meaning to call it to your attention for a couple of weeks now, ever since the magazine came out, and I figure that now is as good a time as any.  Yes?  I hate leaving you empty-handed.<\/p>\n<p>Pomodori al forno is an appetizer served at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cafelago.com\/\">Caf\u00e9 Lago<\/a>, one of my favorite restaurants in Seattle, and is, as the name implies, a dish of oven-roasted tomatoes.  But these are a very fine specimen of the genre.  First, they are roasted long and slow with a bit of sugar and salt, dried oregano, and a good dose of olive oil.  Then, when they are tender and a deep shade of scarlet, you transfer them to a bowl, layer them with lots of minced garlic and parsley, pour the (now tomato-infused) oil from the baking dish over the top, and let them marinate for a few hours.  They wind up rich, concentrated, and sweetly pungent with garlic and herbs, and I have yet to meet a person who didn\u2019t find them completely, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">completely<\/span> addictive.  Especially when served with goat cheese and toasts.  And especially right now, when we should all be eating tomatoes by the dozen, before winter comes and steals them away.<\/p>\n<p>Happy September, everybody.  See you very soon.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today I planned to give you a recipe for a roasted eggplant salad.
