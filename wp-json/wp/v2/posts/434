My first day in town turned out to be his first day off in a month, so we celebrated with a lunch excursion into Cleveland, to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.roadfood.com\/Restaurant\/Review\/4901-4908\/balaton\" target=\"_blank\">Balaton<\/a>. We were seated by a nicely dressed older gentleman who watched over the place from a table in the corner. Between tasks, he ate slices of red apple out of a bowl. An elderly lady with dyed black hair and polyester pants came in shortly after we did, and the gentleman seated her at the next table over. They exchanged greetings in Hungarian, and he helped her out of her coat. Then he brought her a glass of red wine, filled perilously to the rim, and a cup of bean and dumpling soup. She was so quiet and careful, deftly angling her spoon to slice the raft of smoked sausage that floated on top, and watching her, we decided to order two cups of the same. So we ate that, and then we shared a plate of cabbage rolls stuffed with beef and pork and rice (on a bed of sauerkraut!), a small order of schnitzel with more dumplings (in gravy!), and a slice of chestnut torte, and never before, in the history of Cleveland, were there two more contented people. Then we drove home, and now: I WORK.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c1cd6-poladresserforhabit1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5706073609422299234\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c1cd6-poladresserforhabit1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1121\" height=\"866\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>While I do that:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thisamericanlife.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ira Glass<\/a> gives <a href=\"http:\/\/transom.org\/?p=20139\" target=\"_blank\">props<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.radiolab.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Radiolab<\/a>!

I remember being at a show once where Joe Fargis was a judge, or something, and I was sufficiently awestruck that you would have thought he was Michael Jackson. I stopped riding fifteen years ago, and honestly, I don&#8217;t think about it much, but I recently stumbled upon <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bIuRbr6q2wE&amp;sns=fb\" target=\"_blank\">a video<\/a> of that Olympic performance, and as I sat there watching Fargis and Touch of Class, I caught myself tearing up. I\u2019m an old sap, no question, but there\u2019s something to it: two athletes at the top of their game, one horse and one human, both doing what they clearly love to do.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sweetamandine.com\/2011\/11\/ps.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jess\u2019s Teddie\u2019s apple cake<\/a>.
