But personally, I think \u201cmake her a brown-bag lunch\u201d should be added to the list, right up there with love poems, candlelight, and bearskin rugs. <i>Oh baby.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as though he never does <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/355088105\/\">nice things<\/a> for me, because he does plenty.  For example, he has single-handedly grown my collection of vintage Pyrex dishes from two pieces to sixteen in the span of only six months.  [Our local Goodwill <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">loves<\/span> him.]  He regularly <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/10\/on-stewing-and-soup.html\">fixes our dinner<\/a>, keeps me plied with <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/07\/proper-pickle.html\">pickles<\/a>, and helps me eat the sweets that I feel strangely compelled to bake each week.  [The waistband of my pants loves him too.]  But let me tell you, there\u2019s nothing quite so fine as this new brown-bag-lunch business of his.  Not so long ago, I used to stand in front of the fridge at a few minutes to midnight, alone, cursing, trying to <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">cobble or cram together something<\/span> for lunch the next day.  Now I feel so <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">loved<\/span>.    As long as he doesn\u2019t start cutting shapes out of my sandwiches with cookie cutters or sending me off with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.generalmills.com\/corporate\/brands\/brand.aspx?catID=11308\">Fruit Roll-Ups<\/a>, I am <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">so <\/span>marrying this man next July.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, since that soba noodle excitement a few weeks ago, Brandon has shared with me another of his favorite standby lunch items, and today I want to share it with you too.  It\u2019s a dead-simple chickpea salad, a little something he started making when he was a teenager in a program called \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.njpac.org\/load_screen.asp?screen=arts_training\">Jazz for Teens<\/a>\u201d  \u2013 he\u2019s a saxophonist \u2013 and needed a midday meal that he could tote along to his sessions.  Back then, he was deep in what I like to call The Garlic Period \u2013 those bygone days when he would mix minced raw garlic with salt and spread it on buttered toast \u2013 so the original incarnation of this salad was brimming with the stuff.  But in the intervening years, he has tweaked and honed his formula, deciding, even, that with a good olive oil and a grating of good cheese, it didn\u2019t need garlic at all.  What he\u2019s been feeding me lately is a<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> lovely, mellow<\/span> salad that I\u2019d be happy to eat every week from here on out.  In fact, I might go so far as to say that it\u2019s the best <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">five-minute, five-ingredient<\/span> meal I know.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/x\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/871206\/Chickpea_salad.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/01\/Chickpea_salad.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>It starts with a can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed and dumped into a bowl.  Into the mix goes a squirt of fresh lemon juice, a slip of grassy olive oil, a pinch of salt, and some Parmigiano Reggiano.  Stirred together and chilled, it tastes like the sum of its parts \u2013 only about 200% percent better.  The lemon brightens the l\u00e9gumes, lifting their earthy flavor to something lighter and sweeter, while the olive oil makes them taste richer and more savory, as though they\u2019d been cooked in stock.  And the parmesan plays deliciously, as it loves to do, with both the lemon and the oil, binding the whole bowl together with its creamy, resonant charm.  All told, it\u2019s tasty enough to make my colleagues chirp jealously, and to make me <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">chase every last chickpea<\/span> from the container \u2013 and then scrape up the nubs and dribbles with a hunk of bread.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/x\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/117958\/Chickpea_salad%20039-2.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/01\/Chickpea_salad-039-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>It\u2019s such a simple recipe that I\u2019m almost embarrassed to post it here, but because we all need instructions sometimes \u2013 especially late at night, when facing a nearly-empty fridge \u2013 I will anyway.  You might consider eating these chickpeas atop some plump-leafed baby greens, or nestled alongside nearly any vegetable.  I\u2019ve also been known to eat them with some sliced radishes and crusty bread on the side, or, um, sometimes, peanut butter and Wasa crackers.  Even when I <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/01\/happy-new.html\">no longer have a job<\/a> that requires a brown-bag lunch \u2013 a week from Thursday, to be precise; <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">whew<\/span>! \u2013 you can bet, come noon, that I\u2019ll still be sitting down to a bowl of this. Maybe with peanut butter and crackers. Some habits die hard, you know.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Chickpea Salad with Lemon and Parmesan<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This little salad only has five ingredients, so make sure that they\u2019re all of good quality. There\u2019s no room for second-rate pantry closet cast-offs here, so don\u2019t even think about it, missie.  First of all, be sure to use a good brand of chickpeas.  I would never have thought about this sort of thing prior to meeting Brandon, Mr. <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/02\/public-display-of-chickpeas.html\">Chana Masala<\/a> Man, but he\u2019s got me convinced: the best canned chickpeas are produced by Goya, Bush, and Trader Joe\u2019s. Other brands, such as generic supermarket ones, can be mealy, bland, and \/ or mushy, rather than firm, fat, and earthy-sweet. Also, get out your best olive oil \u2013 one you\u2019d want to eat from a spoon, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. We like to use a dash of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.barianioliveoil.com\/index.php\">this luscious brand<\/a>, to which we were introduced by the lovely <a href=\"http:\/\/teaandcookies.blogspot.com\/\">Tea<\/a>.  It really seals the deal.<\/p>\n<p>1 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed<br \/>1 tsp. fresh lemon juice<br \/>1 \u00bd tsp. olive oil<br \/>A pinch of salt<br \/>\u00bc cup loosely packed shredded Parmigiano Reggiano<\/p>\n<p>Combine all ingredients in a bowl, and stir gently to mix. Taste, and adjust seasoning as necessary. Serve immediately, or chill, covered, until serving.<\/p>\n<p><i>Note<\/i>: This salad keeps well in the fridge and is, in my humble opinion, best eaten cold.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 2 servings<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One day a few weeks ago, entirely without prompting, Brandon packed me a lunch for work.
