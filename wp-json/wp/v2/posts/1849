I\u2019ve just returned from five weeks in Paris, ostensibly doing pilot research for an eventual dissertation, but more accurately walking, walking, walking, eating, eating, drinking Champagne, perfecting my Parisian woman poker face, caf\u00e9-sitting, <strong>defending my honor<\/strong> in the face of evil BHV employees, fixing what was broken, being impetuous, thinking, thinking, and learning. I\u2019m not going through with my Ph.D.  I was perhaps the last to see it, but better late than never.<\/p>\n<p>The alternate plan, as it currently stands: I will continue for the coming year, write my Master\u2019s thesis, do lots and lots of writing, and <strong>stick my neck out<\/strong>. Next stop: food writing, or perhaps cookbook editing.  <em>Il faut que je sois fonceuse<\/em>, as those French say.<\/p>\n<p>In the coming weeks, though, I plan to churn through a few cookbooks and bake as much as possible. Maybe work on my meat-roasting techniques too. So this is an official call for a <strong>refreshments management team<\/strong>. Are you in Seattle? How does chocolate sound to you? How about rustic-ish French tartes, cakes, clafoutis, and such? I am the woman for you. I bake, you eat. I eat too, of course, but there\u2019s only so much one girl can do on her lonesome.
