I was aiming to recreate in cake form the chocolate malted milkshakes of my childhood, the kind that I slurped through pink-and-white striped straws at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.braums.com\/\">Braum\u2019s Ice Cream and Dairy Stores<\/a> throughout the state of Oklahoma. Sadly, though, the cupcakes and I had a run-in when they decided to turn into something with the texture of a kitchen sponge, and when they tasted more like a cheap, too-sweet, boxed cake than a chewable incarnation of my beloved chocolate malt. It was a hard weekend, to say the least, and in the end, the best part was finding, in a fit of desperation, a package of baby lima beans in the back of the freezer.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I know that the words \u201clima beans\u201d are not, for most people, synonymous with \u201cdelicious.\u201d A lima bean is nobody\u2019s chocolate malt. But I have long loved its <strong>mild, green flavor<\/strong> and its <strong>soft, starchy creaminess<\/strong>, and I should have written about this dish a long time ago.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/05\/Greek_style_lima_beans_spoon.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>I stumbled upon this recipe almost three years ago now, in an old issue of <em>Gourmet<\/em>. It quickly became a standby, calling, as it does, for only a few basic ingredients: a pack of baby limas, a glug of olive oil, a handful of parsley, and <strong>an unflinching dose of garlic<\/strong>, plus a little water and salt to hold it all together. I could eat these <strong>lima beans like candy<\/strong>, by the handful. I go after them first with my fork, and then I follow with hunks of coarse, crusty bread to sop up the sweet, oil-dotted broth. It may be a modest dish in appearance and name, but under a sheen of grassy olive oil and a pungent cloud of garlic, these lima beans taste better, I think, than most cupcakes. Or mediocre chocolate malt ones, at least.<\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/>Greek-Style Lima Beans<br \/><\/strong>Adapted from <em>Gourmet<\/em>, November 2003<\/p>\n<p>Although this recipe was originally published in early months of winter, it tastes like spring to me. Conveniently, it is also a perfect receptacle for the Italian parsley left over from a batch of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/05\/in-praise-of-poaching.html\">poached halibut<\/a>. You could also try this method with fava beans rather than limas, I\u2019ll bet, if you\u2019re feeling especially bold and brazen. Whatever you do, be sure to serve this with plenty of good, crusty bread: you won\u2019t want to lose a drop of the broth.<\/p>\n<p>1 (10 oz.) package frozen baby lima beans<br \/>1 cup water<br \/>2 Tbs good-quality olive oil, plus more for serving, if you like<br \/>2 Tbs coarsely chopped fresh Italian parsley<br \/>1 Tbs minced garlic<br \/>\u00bd tsp salt<\/p>\n<p>In a medium heavy saucepan, combine the lima beans, water, olive oil, parsley, garlic, and salt. Place the pan over medium heat, and cook, covered but stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender, about 15-20 minutes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Greek_style_lima_beans_far.0.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/05\/Greek_style_lima_beans_far.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Transfer to a serving bowl, and serve, drizzled with more olive oil, if you like.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: About 4 side servings<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I know, I know.
