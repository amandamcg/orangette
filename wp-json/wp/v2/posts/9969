I had started reading again, more than just my perfunctory fifteen minutes before sleep. Hearing different voices and other people&#8217;s thoughts in my head, I started to notice the way they excited me, energized me, made me want to do my own work. So, starting in September of that year, I devoted one of my workdays each week to a new book, a new project. I was embarrassed to tell people that it was another memoir. <em>How mortifying!<\/em>, <em>how presumptuous!<\/em>, working on a third memoir and I was only 39. My life has been very ordinary and continues to be: I&#8217;m a white woman who comes from and lives with privilege. I try to keep this in my sights, because it&#8217;s more important now than ever. I also try to put my head down and shut up and do the work, because the work, the act of writing, is worth it, and I am very lucky to do it. It took eight months, but in May, the proposal was ready, and I was elated to see it land at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.abramsbooks.com\/imprints\/abramspress\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Abrams Press<\/a>, where it will be published in 2020. As soon as I finish writing it.<\/p>\n<p>This book is not about food! People tell me this is risky? If this is what danger looks like, I am now someone who lives for it. This book is a story about sexuality, identity, and the many ways we make the thing we call\u00a0<em>family<\/em>. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever wanted so much to write any single thing, not the way I want to write this book. I am having to learn how to write it as I go along, without the handy crutch that food and recipes had become for me. Sitting at my desk, on a good day at least, I can almost feel the neurons stretch and zing and ping, reach across a synapse, build a new bridge, connect places that weren&#8217;t connected.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"662\" height=\"439\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-9973\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324840005-662x439.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324840005-662x439.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324840005-768x509.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324840005-1324x878.jpg 1324w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324840005-870x577.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I turned forty two months ago, and to celebrate, Ash and I went to Greece, a trip we started planning deep in last winter. I&#8217;d wanted to go for years, ever since my friends Christophe and <a href=\"http:\/\/dressingfordinner.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gemma<\/a>\u00a0first went and shared some photos from their trip online. We spent most of our time on the island of Milos, in the western Cyclades, and a little time on Sifnos, too, which is known for its pottery traditions. I quietly set myself a goal of getting more comfortable swimming in open water &#8212; you will note that this goal was very open-ended; &#8220;getting more comfortable&#8221; will never be measured by any yardstick &#8212; and little by little, I chipped away at it. Metaphors! I will leave this one here for you.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9972 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324840001-e1543428966773-663x1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"663\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324840001-e1543428966773-663x1000.jpg 663w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324840001-e1543428966773-331x500.jpg 331w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324840001-e1543428966773-768x1158.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324840001-e1543428966773-870x1312.jpg 870w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324840001-e1543428966773.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>June is six and is thriving. I feel less like writing about her online, mindful of the fact that she&#8217;s going to live in this online world one day and should get to speak for herself. I think it&#8217;s okay, though, to mention that she is possibly the world&#8217;s number one fan of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2015\/10\/on-short-notice\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">beans and greens<\/a>, refuses raw tomatoes and a wide variety of vegetables, lives for meat meat MEAT, and shares my passion for Nerds and sour gummies. Brandon gave me an Instant Pot for my birthday. I checked out\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2zED5TN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Dinner in an Instant<\/em><\/a>\u00a0from the library, and June, thumbing through it, promptly requested Garlicky Cuban Pork. (Hot tip: do degrease the juices after cooking, preferably with a fat separator.) Ash has also made a bang-up Shrimp Scampi from the same book. We are now Instant Pot believers. If this blog were still thriving, and if it had stayed solely about food, it would probably become one of those Instant Pot blogs.<\/p>\n<p>June took the three photos that follow, using the old Pentax K1000 camera I bought myself in 2008 and film that was left in my parents&#8217; freezer after my dad died in 2002. She calls it her camera now, and these shots are from her second-ever roll. Burg would be proud. Atta girl.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"662\" height=\"439\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-9975\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850015-662x439.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850015-662x439.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850015-768x509.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850015-1324x878.jpg 1324w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850015-870x577.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/> <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"662\" height=\"439\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-9976\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850025-662x439.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850025-662x439.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850025-768x509.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850025-1324x878.jpg 1324w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850025-870x577.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"662\" height=\"439\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-9977\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850011-662x439.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850011-662x439.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850011-768x509.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850011-1324x878.jpg 1324w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/000324850011-870x577.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What a pleasure this is.
