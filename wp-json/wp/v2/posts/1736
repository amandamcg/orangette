Upon closer inspection, I saw that his fingers were tracing <strong>four curvy, boldface words: <em>New Mexican Flour Tortillas<\/em><\/strong>. Now, by way of background, dear reader, you should know that Brandon is a great devotee of a certain brand of ultra-fresh refrigerated flour tortillas sold at New York\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fairwaymarket.com\/\">Fairway Market<\/a>, and here in Seattle, he\u2019s been just short of starving, an exhaustive tortilla search having as yet failed to yield a good local source for anything resembling the soft, chewy specimen he\u2019s grown accustomed to. For a man who lists among his principal interests \u201canything with the consistency of salsa,\u201d <strong>the scarcity of worthwhile tortillas<\/strong> is downright dangerous. But that afternoon, the search came to an end\u2014and with a turning point that steered us to the only place we\u2019d forgotten to consider, the kitchen.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, a celebration was in order, and by happy coincidence, a national holiday was strategically positioned only a few days away. With a brief strategizing session, a bit of menu planning, and a hot cast-iron skillet, we could have <strong>an apartmentful of friends and fresh tortillas, and a fireworks show to celebrate <em>our<\/em> Independence Day, an end to the tyranny of sub-par supermarket flatbreads<\/strong>. So it was that yesterday evening, <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/04\/sugar-high-friday-or-long-distance.html\">Kate<\/a> arrived at six with a bagful of guacamole ingredients; mushrooms, bell peppers, and red onion for roasting; <strong>a one-gallon tub of <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.remlingerfarms.com\/\"><strong>hand-picked raspberries<\/strong><\/a>; and a pint of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/02\/bagnette-breasts-and-excuse-to-eat.html\">whipping cream<\/a>; and <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/il-faut-cultiver-notre-jardin.html\">Nicho<\/a> followed shortly thereafter with his lovely girlfriend Nicole, a few chicken sausages, and hard cider. Brandon and I had spent the afternoon simmering a pot of black beans with saut\u00e9ed onion, jalape\u00f1o, and cumin seeds, and as the hours passed, he slaved happily away at three signature hot sauces: a fire-roasted tomato salsa, a chunky pico de gallo, and a fiery green sauce of garlic, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, lime juice, and salt. On the other side of the kitchen, I turned to the tortillas.<\/p>\n<p>With only four ingredients\u2014flour, salt, shortening, and water\u2014they were heartbreakingly simple to make, the dough like a silky, resilient fabric. With my mother\u2019s old wooden rolling pin in hand, I sank into an easy rhythm: roll, cook, flip, cook, roll, cook, flip, cook.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/07\/Tortillas_rolling_adjusted.jpg\" width=\"419\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The warm tortillas were <strong>thin and tender, crisp outside and yielding inside, with the rich sweetness of flour bound with salt and fat<\/strong>. We huddled around the table with a gold-tinged stash of them\u2014soft, seconds-old, toothsome scoops for salsas and spicy tar-black beans, chunks of seared sausage and roasted pepper, creamy guacamole, and cooling sour cream.<\/p>\n<p>In one little apartment in Seattle, America had a very happy Independence Day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Flour Tortillas<\/strong><br \/>Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/0811821609\/qid=1119555003\/sr=2-1\/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1\/102-1274064-2961714\"><em>Saveur Cooks Authentic American<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d always thought I was more of a corn-tortilla girl than a flour one, but this recipe has solidly converted me. Once you get a feel for the dough and settle into the rhythm of rolling and cooking it, you might never want to buy tortillas again.<\/p>\n<p>4 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour<br \/>1 \u00bc tsp salt<br \/>6 Tbs vegetable shortening (preferably a non-hydrogenated type, such as Spectrum)<\/p>\n<p>In a small saucepan, bring about 2 cups of water to a boil.<\/p>\n<p>In a large bowl, stir the flour and salt together with a whisk. Mix in the shortening with your fingers until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Stir in enough boiling water (about 1 \u00bc to 1 \u00bd cups) that the dough holds together; you will want to begin by stirring with a spoon, since the water is scorching hot, but you should finish by working the dough with your hands.<\/p>\n<p>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth, 2-5 minutes. Do not overwork it. Form the dough into a ball, cover it with plastic wrap, and allow it to rest for 30 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Set a well-seasoned 9&#8243; cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured surface, and cut it into 6 wedges. Cut each wedge into 3 smaller wedges, for a total of 18 wedges. Use a rolling pin to roll out a wedge into a very thin circle\u2014as thin as you can make it, like a sheet of fabric\u2014roughly 7 \u00bd to 8 inches in diameter. When the skillet is hot but not smoking, cook the tortilla until slightly puffed, about 20-30 seconds. Flip, then cook for 20-30 seconds more, or until flecked with golden or brown (whichever you prefer) spots. Place on a cooling rack. Repeat the process with the other 17 wedges. Allow each tortilla to cool completely before stacking them.<\/p>\n<p>Freshly made tortillas are soft and perfectly delicious at room temperature, but to reheat them, you can warm them briefly in a low oven. These keep well in the fridge, wrapped in paper towels and sealed in a plastic bag, and they also freeze nicely.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 18 tortillas<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Fourth of July is, no question, pretty exciting.
