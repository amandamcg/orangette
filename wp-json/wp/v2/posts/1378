Can it be true?  Is it really November 5? Only 17 days before Thanksgiving? And did I really see that terrible ad for Lowe\u2019s last night, the Christmas one with the giant snow globe and the dancing holiday turkey?  (Also, did I really admit, by saying that just now, that despite our having proudly \u201cgiven up\u201d television last year, Brandon and I still pull the old box out of the closet every now and then, and that even though we canceled our cable plan, we found that you can use the old cable cord as an antenna, jiggling it and posing it <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">just so<\/span> until the picture is passably clear, except that it means you have to tiptoe back to the couch very, very carefully, or else you\u2019ll disturb the whole precarious arrangement?) It can\u2019t be possible.<\/p>\n<p>I love November.  It\u2019s my mother\u2019s birth month, so I really owe it quite a lot.  I just don\u2019t like what it means: the (almost) end of the year, the end of warmth (at least until spring), the end of daylight savings time, the inevitable ramp-up to all-out holiday craziness.  I get tired just thinking about it.  I need an <a href=\"http:\/\/images.asia.ru\/img\/alibaba\/img\/product\/11\/67\/18\/11671898.jpg\">eye pillow<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/36afa-roastedpears038-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/36afa-roastedpears038-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5129179617131046386\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>No, wait.  Scratch that.  You can\u2019t get away with an eye pillow unless you\u2019re a) <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joan_Collins\">Joan Collins<\/a>, or b) on an overseas flight, and even then, it\u2019s questionable.  I\u2019d rather have a roasted pear.  They\u2019re warm, for one thing, scented with vanilla bean and lemon.  And with the way their little backs curve, it seems to me that they would fit perfectly, rounded side down, in the hollow of each eye.    Doesn\u2019t that sound nice?  So warm, so fragrant, so soothing.  They may be the best part of November, until Thanksgiving anyway.<\/p>\n<p>I really could go on and on about these pears, and if my schedule this week weren\u2019t giving me the shakes, I might.  It\u2019s a method I first heard about a few weeks ago, when Brandon and I were listening to <a href=\"http:\/\/splendidtable.publicradio.org\/\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The Splendid Table<\/span><\/a> one Sunday over lunch.  By the way, if you don\u2019t listen to the show already, you really should consider it.  Lynne Rossetto Kasper, its host, is so lovely.  She\u2019s quite contagious, in the best possible way.  She has a wonderful voice &#8211; the kind fairy tales should be read in, I\u2019ve always thought &#8211; and when she starts laughing, she sort of cackles and wheezes.  I love her.  I want to invite her to dinner.   Anyway, on October 13, I think it was, she had <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anewwaytocook.com\/\">Sally Schneider<\/a>, author of <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">A New Way to Cook <\/span>and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The Improvisational Cook<\/span>, on the show.  The two of them were talking and cackling and oohing and aahing about Sally\u2019s recipe for roasted pears.  It\u2019s simple as can be: she just halves them, tosses them with sugar, butter, and vanilla bean, and then bakes them until they\u2019re caramelized. My favorite part was when Sally told Lynne &#8211; with a slightly conspiratorial air &#8211; that a few nights earlier, she\u2019d made a double batch for a dinner party, and one of her guests ate almost all of them straight from the pan before the meal was even served.<\/p>\n<p>Having now made them, I can understand why.  Pears are plenty fine on their own, but oh my, roasted pears are even finer.  The dry heat of the oven intensifies their flavor, for one thing, and with a sticky, see-through sheath of vanilla sugar to boot &#8211; not to mention butter, ah butter &#8211; they almost make November worth the trouble.  Almost.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Roasted Pears<\/span><br \/>Adapted from <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">A New Way to Cook<\/span>, by Sally Schneider<\/p>\n<p>This recipe could be tweaked any number of ways. Roasted pears are just the beginning, really. Some thoughts and suggestions:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">1.  Try this method with other fruits.  Think plums, apricots, peaches, apples, pineapples, strawberries(!), bananas(!), and even mangoes.  Whatever fruit you use, it should be peeled (if there\u2019s tough skin involved) and pitted (if it\u2019s a stone fruit) and either halved or sliced \u00bd to \u00be inch thick.  Softer fruits, or sliced fruits, will take much less time than harder or halved ones.<\/p>\n<p>2.  Sugar-wise, play around.  You\u2019ll see that the recipe below makes one cup of vanilla sugar, but you\u2019ll only need a fraction of it.   See what tastes right to you.  I used \u00bc cup, and it seemed about right.   Whatever you do, you\u2019ll have sugar left over, which just means that you\u2019ll have to roast more fruit \u2013 <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:85%;\">darn!<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:85%;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\u2013 or use it in another dessert.  You could also try using honey or maple syrup in place of the sugar, but it would be a little harder to work the vanilla in.<\/p>\n<p>3.  Sally Schneider uses only two teaspoons of butter, which seems downright stingy to me, so I used two tablespoons.  Watch out, Sally.  You never know what I\u2019ll do next.<\/p>\n<p>4.  I like the purity of using only vanilla bean here, but if you want a little added complexity, try dusting your pears with a pinch of cinnamon.  Or maybe some cardamom, with roasted apricots.  Or fresh thyme leaves with plums.<\/p>\n<p>5. Cooked this way, pears get nice and tender, but they hold their shape and stay somewhat firm.  They\u2019re soft, but depending on their ripeness, they might not be <\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">quite as yielding as you\u2019d hope.   That\u2019s my only beef with them: I want them to <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:85%;\">slump<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">.  If you\u2019d like yours a little more tender, I\u2019d suggest trying a couple of things: put more water in the pan to start with &#8211; maybe 1\/3 cup &#8211; and\/or try covering the pan with aluminum foil for some of the baking time.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><br \/>1 cup granulated sugar<br \/>1 vanilla bean<br \/>4 medium ripe pears (about 1 \u00bd lb.), preferably Comice or Bartlett<br \/>2 tsp. fresh lemon juice<br \/>2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces<br \/>Water<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F.<\/p>\n<p>Place the sugar in a small bowl.  With a thin sharp knife, split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds.  Add the seeds to the bowl of sugar.  Using your fingers, rub the seeds into the sugar until evenly dispersed.  (Discard the spent pod, or bury it in a canister of sugar \u2013 soon it\u2019ll have a wonderful fragrance, and you can use it in most any recipe \u2013 or use it to make <a href=\"http:\/\/www.travelerslunchbox.com\/journal\/2007\/10\/9\/project-vanilla.html\">vanilla extract<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Peel the pears and halve them lengthwise.  Core them, if you like.  (I didn\u2019t bother, but it would make them easier to eat.  Whichever you choose, leave the stems intact.  They make for a pretty presentation.)  Place them cut side up in a large baking dish and drizzle them with the lemon juice.  Dust liberally with some of the vanilla sugar.  (I used \u00bc cup.)  Dot with butter.   Add 2 tablespoons water to the dish.<\/p>\n<p>Slide the dish into the oven, and bake the pears, basting every ten minutes with the pan juices and turning them once or twice, for 40  minutes to 1 hour, or until they are glazed, cooked through, and very tender.   The syrup in the dish will thicken and darken as it cooks, but if it evaporates too quickly \u2013 before the pears are ready \u2013 add a tablespoon or two more water to the dish.  (I added 2 tablespoons at the 30-minute mark and another 2 at 40 minutes, stirring them into the caramelly pan juices with my basting brush.)<\/p>\n<p>Serve warm, with ice cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, or a glug of cream.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Note<\/span>: I could also imagine serving these as a savory side dish to roasted pork or game, if you used some interesting spices and a light hand with the sugar.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 4 servings<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Oh November, November, November.
