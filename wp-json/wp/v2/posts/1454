I feel that way about morels, only minus the orange-red part, and the cables, and the bit about going somewhere.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be blas\u00e9 about morels.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/f056b-morels015-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/f056b-morels015-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5082725902156712082\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>This is one of those times, in all honesty, when I feel silly to be sitting here, writing this.  I mean, the dish I want to share with you is saut\u00e9ed mushrooms served on toast.  It\u2019s a topic that hardly warrants a recipe, much less a whole treatise.  But one day a couple of weeks ago, Brandon and I happened upon a crate of local <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Morel\">morels<\/a> at the market, and on a whim, we asked for a half-pound.  It was only eight dollars \u2013 a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">steal<\/span>, people \u2013 and so we shook the vendor\u2019s hand and hurried them home, giggling all the while like a pair of thieves after a particularly good robbery.  I threw a knob of butter into our big, heavy skillet and set it on the heat, and when it had turned to a fragrant slurry, I tossed in the mushrooms.  They sizzled for a minute and then set to softening, wringing themselves out like tiny sponges, and when they were nearly dry, I stirred in a spoonful of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche from a carton that I found at the back of the fridge.  We piled the cream-slicked morels atop slices of toasted bread, and then we sat down to eat, and that\u2019s when a silence fell over the table.  No, scratch that.  It wasn\u2019t silence, because there was some contented sighing too, and I believe that someone \u2013 possibly me, in fact \u2013 banged her fist on the table in swoony disbelief, mid-swallow.  Brandon announced that he felt like a king.  I nodded in agreement, smacking my lips, and pronounced myself his queen.  We chewed, and we sighed, and we slapped our thighs, and so it went for at least ten minutes, the two of us, totally and completely silly with satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>Hence this treatise today, and a recipe of sorts, because since that night, I\u2019ve been socking away every spare penny to buy more morels, so long as the season lasts.  It made sound spendy, but I\u2019ll tell you a secret: Brandon has been out of town, and buying morels for one is <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">much<\/span> easier than buying them for two.  In fact, it\u2019s downright cheap.  (Plus, I can eat them atop the hippie-style wheat bread I like to keep around, and no one is here to scoff or complain.  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Phew<\/span>.)<\/p>\n<p>And there\u2019s something about eating a food so rare, so sought-after, and so drop-dead simple to prepare.  Warmed in butter, morels relax and bloom, releasing their rich, woodsy flavor to mingle with the sweet, toasty fat.  A glug of cream may seem a tad over the top, but for me, it\u2019s the clincher.  Stirred around the pan, it picks up any slips and nubs of flavor stuck to the surface, and it slides around the mushrooms like a soft, velvety cloak. All told, it goes down astoundingly well with a gin and tonic, just so you know, and a green salad is nice too, and piles of summer fruit for dessert.  Sighing is optional, but suggested.<\/p>\n<p><b>Creamed Morels on Toast<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Lately I\u2019ve been eating as many morels as my wallet will allow, and when it comes to cooking them, my best advice is this: <i>keep it simple<\/i>.  Many people like to add minced shallots or garlic, or a squeeze of lemon, or chives, or wine, or whatnot, but not me.  I say, let \u2018em be.  Their flavor is delicate, nutty, and fleeting, and it needs only butter and a little cream to coax it out.  I cooked some today with a small shallot \u2013 which is pretty classic, recommended by countless recipes and cookbooks \u2013 but its sweet, pungent fragrance just smothered the poor things.  From here out, I\u2019m sticking with my usual, bare-bones method, outlined below. It\u2019s only a rough guide, and you need not really measure: you could use more or less of nearly any ingredient, and the end result wouldn\u2019t suffer.  You could even use another wild mushroom, if morels aren\u2019t available.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and about the toast.  If you\u2019ve got a nice, chewy-crumbed country loaf lying around, that\u2019s perfect.  Or a baguette.  Either way, I like to take a slice, drizzle it lightly with olive oil, and slip it under the broiler until it has just a touch of color.  In a pinch, though, even my regular old sandwich bread does a pretty fine job.  It\u2019s just some hippie-dippy sprouted wheat stuff, but toasted \u2013 and buttered, or left plain, either way \u2013 its earthy flavor and nubbly crust make a nice foil for the rich mushrooms.<\/p>\n<p>About 3-4 ounces fresh morels<br \/>About 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter<br \/>1-2 Tbsp. heavy cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche<br \/>Salt, to taste<\/p>\n<p>Clean the mushrooms with a small brush \u2013 a pastry brush works nicely \u2013 to remove any dirt and debris and hidden woodland cargo.  Cut them in half lengthwise, and brush out their hollow centers as well.  If they seem sandy, wash them briefly in water, and drain them well.  [Ideally, though, you don\u2019t want to get them wet unless you absolutely have to.]   Set them aside.<\/p>\n<p>In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Add the morels and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to release some water.  Reduce the heat to medium, let the mushrooms reabsorb their juices, and continue cooking until they are nearly dry.  Add the cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, season with a dash of salt, and stir over the heat for a minute or so, to incorporate the cream.  Serve, with additional salt as needed, over toast.<\/p>\n<p><i>Note<\/i>:  Like many things, these morels are even better the next day.  I like to reheat them briefly \u2013 in the microwave; <i>gasp<\/i>! \u2013 so that their juices flow freely, and I\u2019m continually stunned by how much fuller their flavor seems after an overnight rest in the fridge.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 2 small servings, or 1 bigger one, or 1 small serving with <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">delicious<\/span> leftovers<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over morels.
