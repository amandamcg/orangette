Yesterday we did a Very Adult Thing: we went to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swansonsnursery.com\/\">a nursery<\/a> and bought plants\u2014herbs, at that!\u2014for our patio. It was exhilarating, and also a little sobering. Having grown up in the suburbs of central Oklahoma\u2014where the yards are neat and well fertilized, the flower beds carefully tended, and elaborate sprinkler systems sing sweetly at 6:00 am\u2014I tend to equate the presence of a well-tended garden with the presence of responsible, established adults. As of yesterday, I guess that would be us, sort of\u2014except that our garden is just six or so pots on the patio.<\/p>\n<p>But by god, I mean to milk those pots for all they\u2019re worth. So last night, to celebrate our newly minted status as amateur gardeners, I trotted out a recipe tailor-made for the task: an amalgam of summery <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Allium\">alliums<\/a> and a few of our new herbs.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/07\/Rigatoni_top.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>\nRather poetically titled \u201cRigatoni with Five Lilies and Ricotta Salata,\u201d the recipe had been languishing in my accordion folder, its newsprint going brittle and pale yellow, waiting patiently for the right occasion. It was the title that intrigued me, mainly, with its seeming promise of flowers unfolding amidst coils of pasta and coarse ribbons of cheese. As it turns out, the \u201clilies\u201d referred to are onions, garlic, leeks, scallions, and chives\u2014not real members of the lily family, per se, but close cousins who once occupied the same taxonomic group. A tricky turn of phrase, maybe, but I liked the idea\u2014and anyway, the smell of slow-cooking onions and leeks is a close second, I think, to a bouquet of lilies. So with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sweetonions.org\/\">Walla Walla<\/a> season now upon us, not to mention a supply of herbs just outside the door, I took it that the time, at long last, had come.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Rigatoni_close.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/07\/Rigatoni_close.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nAnd <em>what <\/em>a time it is. He who reads this and doesn\u2019t proceed immediately to the market\u2014or side patio\u2014will be sorry. It may sound like an unassuming list of ingredients, but somewhere between the five forms of onion, the pasta, and the cheese hides a lush fragrance that unfolds\u2014not unlike a lily, I might add\u2014under the gentle pressure of the stove\u2019s heat. With both olive oil and butter in the pan, the kitchen smells like Italy by way of France. The sweet onions go soft and golden brown, while the leeks and scallions loosen up, shaking off their sharp edges. All together, so many alliums could make a cloying, sicky-sweet mess, but somehow, they don\u2019t. With a gentle, tangy punch from ricotta salata and a bright spark from fresh chives and parsley, this plate is well worth its poetic name. And even better, it\u2019s a good excuse for raiding the pots on the patio.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Rigatoni with Five Lilies and Ricotta Salata<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <i>The Babbo Cookbook<\/i> and the <i>San Francisco Chronicle<\/i><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2006-07-11T19:27:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1646?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>I tore this recipe out of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Chronicle<\/span> a few years ago, back when <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Babbo Cookbook <\/span>first came out, and I\u2019m kicking myself for not trying it earlier. If you feel any sort of affinity for either leeks or caramelized onions, do not delay: this recipe will be a keeper in your kitchen. It certainly will be in ours. To wit: between mouthfuls, Brandon said to me, \u201cYou know, your blog is really good for us. We\u2019re such creatures of habit. If it weren\u2019t for Orangette, we\u2019d probably eat this every night for weeks.\u201d I nodded, but what I really wanted to say was, \u201cScrew the variety-for-the-sake-of-the-blog thing! I want more rigatoni.\u201d Oh, Orangette, the sacrifices I make for you.<\/p>\n<p>A final note: Brandon tried squeezing a bit of lemon over his serving, and he found it quite tasty.

Add the sweet onions, and reduce the heat.

Remove the pan from the heat, and transfer the onions to a bowl. Set aside.<\/p>\n<p>In the same skillet, heat the butter over medium heat. When it has stopped foaming and is thoroughly melted, add the garlic, leeks, red onion, and scallions, and cook, stirring regularly, until very soft and golden. Add the water, and cook until the liquid evaporates. Season lightly with salt. Remove from the heat, and stir in the sweet onions.<\/p>\n<p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook the rigatoni until tender but al dente. In the last minute of cooking, return the onion mixture to medium-high heat. Drain the pasta, add it to the onion mixture, and toss over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and toss more, if necessary, to thoroughly disperse the onions amidst the pasta. Serve immediately, topped with plenty of ricotta salata and sprinklings of parsley and chives. Salt as needed, and finish with a quick squeeze of lemon, if you like.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 4 servings<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I feel like such a big girl.
