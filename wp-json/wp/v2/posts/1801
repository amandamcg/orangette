A twenty-dollar seven-course \u201cChef\u2019s Experience\u201d menu at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mistralseattle.com\/\">Mistral<\/a>, thank you very much. Armed with a fortuitous inside connection, four of us enjoyed a <strong>tr\u00e8s haute-cuisine dinner <\/strong>free of charge\u2014save for the tip, which, after all, is only civilized.<\/p>\n<p>Tucked away next to an alley in Seattle\u2019s Belltown district, Mistral is unassuming to the eye: a long, narrow, simply decorated space with pale walls and a tall ceiling. The restaurant was opened in January 2000 by chef William Belickis, who turns out decadent, largely French-influenced fare with an emphasis on local ingredients.<\/p>\n<p>We began with a Champagne whose name I\u2014falling down on the job\u2014neglected to note, and then the feast proceeded as follows:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Kusshi oyster with grapefruit slices and celery foam for the other three\u2014and for oyster-fearing me, a square filet of <strong>Arctic char on shaved white asparagus<\/strong> with some sort of green-colored and green-tasting pur\u00e9e splattered around, crunchy salt and crispy skin on top<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; An enormous diver sea scallop (beautifully seared to a burnished brown, again with crunchy nuggets of salt; very meaty and sweet) in a smooth <strong>brown-butter and parsnip soup<\/strong> with drizzle of basil oil and spoonful of carrot foam (minerally, earthy, but I\u2019m indifferent to this foam thing)<br \/>\n<br \/><em>2002 Mason Sauvignon Blanc<br \/>\n<br \/><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Wild Atlantic skate (a bit too salty, unfortunately) on a bed of silky cubed eggplant, thinly sliced turnips, and pearl onions, with a translucent green <strong>lettuce-and-Madras-curry sauce<\/strong>, drizzle of basil oil<br \/>\n<br \/><em>2003 Forman Napa Valley Chardonnay<br \/>\n<br \/><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Seared Sonoma artisanal foie gras* (crowned with <strong>ubiquitous crunchy salt<\/strong>; the whole melting instantly on the tongue) on a comice pear pur\u00e9e with a passionfruit and Tahitian vanilla bean reduction, with Granny Smith apple chips.<br \/>\n<br \/><em>1988 Tokaji<\/em> (from Hungary, amber brown, sweet but clean, not cloying, raisin-y)<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Moulard duck or Oregon lamb chop (two of each for the table, both beautifully rare) on fingerling potato pur\u00e9e (too sweet; very odd) with Swiss chard, \u201cThumbelina\u201d carrots, chive oil, red wine reduction, and zatar-infused olive oil<br \/>\n<br \/><em>2000 Arcadian Monterey Pinot Noir<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Slivers of five cheeses: Pav\u00e9 de Jadis (creamy, mild goat), semi-soft Pecorino, Agour (Spanish sheep\u2019s milk), Persil de Beaujolais (cow\u2019s milk blue), Brillat Savarin (triple-cr\u00e8me cow)<br \/>\n<br \/><em>Red wine I neglected to write down, being in mid-story (Cabernet?)<br \/>\n<br \/><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Two of each for the table: a round of genoise-ish cake topped with <strong>a quenelle of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream<\/strong>, with tapioca and pomegranate seeds scattered all around; and a small pot of ice cream (vanilla and something unidentifiable), a shot of hot chocolate, and two vanilla sugar cookies<\/p>\n<p>Very inventive and absolutely exemplary all around, minus the few quibbles as noted. Thank you, L.L., for a very glamorous and delicious evening. I\u2019m a more than willing partner anytime. Another scallop, please!<br \/>\n<br \/><em><\/em><br \/>\n<br \/><em>But<\/em> I have to admit (and not without some shame) that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m cut out for &#8220;fine dining.&#8221; I put my elbows on the table; I feel silly swirling my wine glass; and I&#8217;m worthless if you&#8217;re looking to suss out the herbs and spices in a dish. This does not bode well for a career in food writing. I need more educating, or maybe more audacity. Then again, while there is much to be said for the expert balancing of flavors that a four-star chef can achieve, <strong>satisfaction is a fine roasted chicken and a slab of ridiculously rich chocolate cake<\/strong>, honey.<\/p>\n<p>*Although I hesitated when the head waiter asked if we were all willing to eat foie gras, I decided to nod my agreement, choosing on this occasion to overlook my ethical concerns for the sake of my palate\u2019s education. <strong>Forgive me; it was delicious, so smooth and so warm<\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Inspired by Kate\u2014who was inspired by someone else I can\u2019t remember\u2014I present the good, the very good, and the wonderful of the past week, all lumped together and in no particular order, which sort of defeats the purpose: 1.
