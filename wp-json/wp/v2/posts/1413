His name is Adam.  You may know him better, actually, as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amateurgourmet.com\/\">Amateur Gourmet<\/a>.   Adam and I met a couple of years ago, on a blustery winter afternoon in New York, where he lives.  He\u2019s a very hard guy not to like, no matter how bad the weather.  He\u2019s all smiles and smart jokes, easygoing and inquisitive.  So when he came to Seattle last winter with his boyfriend Craig &#8211; who, in case you were wondering, is utterly charming and funny and eminently worthy &#8211; Brandon and I cooked them a New Year\u2019s lunch of pan-seared chicken and yogurt cake.    I overbaked the cake a little, and it was kind of dry and sad, but they didn\u2019t say a peep, and though I liked them plenty already, I liked them even more after that.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Amateur-Gourmet-Shop-Table-Almost\/dp\/0553804979\/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1\/002-8255447-5270407?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1190595359&amp;sr=8-1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/dbf8a-agbookcover1.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5113567888297116098\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Well, a couple of months ago, Adam came back to Seattle to visit Craig, who was shooting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trueadolescents.com\/\">a movie<\/a> in town this summer, and he called to ask, quite out of the blue, if I might like to go for a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amateurgourmet.com\/2007\/07\/happy_trails.html\">horseback ride<\/a>.  (He always has a surprise up his sleeve; don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.)  I said yes, and so it was that on a hot July day, on a trail on the side of Tiger Mountain, astride our steeds Chick and Friday Night Girl, Adam told me about his book <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Amateur-Gourmet-Shop-Table-Almost\/dp\/0553804979\/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1\/002-8255447-5270407?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1190595359&amp;sr=8-1\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The Amateur Gourmet: How to Shop, Chop, and Table-Hop like a Pro (Almost)<\/span><\/a>, thereby setting into motion a chain of events that would lead, only a little circuitously, to a tomato sauce that I believe, oh my, may be the most perfect one ever invented.<\/p>\n<p>(Adam, I owe you one.)<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t yet seen Adam\u2019s book, I sincerely suggest that you make it your business to do so immediately.  And I don\u2019t just say that because I like the guy.  His book, part-memoir and part-how-to, is pure pleasure, a sweet, fresh, effortless story whose pages almost turn themselves.  Food lovers can be a tough, know-it-all crowd, but Adam makes being a beginner &#8211; at cooking, at dining out, at learning about food &#8211; feel inspiring and appealing and, once and for all, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">okay<\/span>.  I\u2019m not usually the type to laugh aloud while reading, or even, really, to break a smile &#8211; I\u2019m focused, people, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">focused<\/span> &#8211; but Adam got a good half-dozen grins out of me.  (To wit, page 152: \u201cDining by myself . . . is a scary prospect.  It\u2019s not a coincidence, perhaps, that \u2018dining alone\u2019 sounds so much like \u2018dying alone.\u2019   For many, the fear of dining alone is the same fear that causes them to marry the wrong person, to maintain destructive friendships, and to participate in group suicide.\u201d) He also got me to make tomato sauce, and for that I will be eternally grateful.<\/p>\n<p>It only took a dozen pages.  (I\u2019m very susceptible to suggestion.) His first chapter, titled  \u201cStart with Spaghetti,\u201d tells the funny, bittersweet story of a meal his mother once cooked for his father, a plate of spaghetti with homemade tomato sauce that went terribly awry.  As chance would have it, some twenty-odd years and many TV dinners later, it would be a tomato sauce, made alone in his apartment kitchen, that would send Adam head over heels in love with cooking.  I read this late one night, and it sounded so lovely and so right, and though half-asleep in my pink striped pajama pants, I thought, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Tomato sauce!  TOMATO SAUCE, Molly!   How can you have toddled along all this time &#8211; writing this silly so-called food blog, marrying a man who lives and breathes for <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/09\/di-fara-pizza-and-exaggeration-that.html\">pizza<\/a>, writing a <\/span>cookbook<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">, for crying out loud &#8211; if you<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">ve never made tomato sauce?<\/span>  It was an important night.<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, I got right on it.  Though Adam offers a recipe in his book &#8211; a sure winner, in fact, Mario Batali\u2019s from <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The Babbo Cookbook<\/span> &#8211; I remembered hearing very persuasive things about a tomato sauce with onion and butter by Marcella Hazan, the venerable Italian cookbook author whose sturdy, no-nonsense, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">nonna<\/span>-like tone always puts me right at ease.  (And, as I soon discovered, Adam himself deemed her sauce <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amateurgourmet.com\/2005\/01\/marcella_hazans.html\">\u201cbrilliant.\u201d<\/a>  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\"><\/span>I trusted, then, he wouldn\u2019t mind if saved Mario\u2019s for later.)  So Friday night, I pulled out a can of San Marzano tomatoes, an onion, and our stash of butter, and I made tomato sauce.  Having now done so, I strongly advise you to do the same &#8211; only preferably even sooner than Friday.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7ffae-tomatosauce027-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7ffae-tomatosauce027-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5113232807833584018\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Tomato sauce made with the usual suspects &#8211; olive oil and garlic, generally &#8211; is a very worthy classic.  But with a little (or a lot of) butter, it\u2019s another thing entirely.  It tastes pure: rich, round, and deeply reassuring, like tomato sauce is supposed to taste.  The first words that spring to mind, actually, are <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">va-va-voom<\/span>, which are hardly words at all, really, and are probably better suited to a young <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artgallery.umd.edu\/chim\/images\/sophia.jpg\">Sophia Loren<\/a>, but still, I mean it: this is a show-stopping, voluptuous sauce.   The butter bolsters the sweetness of the tomatoes and rounds off their acidic edges, while the onion &#8211; which is halved, simmered slowly in the sauce, and then discarded &#8211; lends just a subtle, savory backdrop.  Brandon and I ate it on spaghetti, along with a good grating of Parmigiano, and we scraped our plates as though starved.  (Which, come to think of it, I guess we were, given the dearth of homemade tomato sauce around here.)  Brandon even let loose a few <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">wow<\/span>s, which I heartily seconded.<\/p>\n<p>Adam, the next time you\u2019re in town, please stop by.  I\u2019ll have a pot of tomato sauce on the stove.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tomato Sauce with Onion and Butter<\/span><br \/>Adapted from <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking<\/span>, by Marcella Hazan*<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d81e0-tomatosauce011-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d81e0-tomatosauce011-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5113159308058247506\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Hazan calls for imported Italian plum tomatoes, such as San Marzano, but mine were domestically grown, and the sauce still tasted like Italy to me.

Add a pinch or two of salt.  Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer.  Cook, uncovered, at a very slow but steady simmer, adjusting the heat as necessary, for about 45 minutes, or until droplets of fat float free from the tomato.  Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces of tomato with the back of a wooden spoon.   Taste and salt as needed.<\/p>\n<p>Discard the onion before tossing the sauce with pasta.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: Enough sauce for about 1 pound of pasta, or 4 servings<\/p>\n<p>* <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">With cheers and kisses to Ms. Luisa Weiss, the esteemed <a href=\"http:\/\/wednesdaychef.typepad.com\/\">Wednesday Chef<\/a>, who bought us this book as a wedding present and wisely suggested that we make this sauce.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good to admit this sort of thing, but until three days ago, I had never made tomato sauce.
