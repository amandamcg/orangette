I\u2019ve spent a lot of time worrying, watching the clock do its<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> tick tock tick tock<\/span> thing, and feeling pretty terrible about it. If you have a blog, you will know what I mean: this stuff is fun, but it comes with a lot of pressure. For a long time &#8211; six years on July 29th &#8211; this blog has been about stories and recipes, and it always will be. Always. But somewhere along the line, I now realize, writing about stories and recipes began to feel like a rule, like all I was allowed to do. I came to believe that if I didn\u2019t have a recipe, I had no story, and that meant I had nothing to post about. That was fine, and it felt neat and tidy and well defined, and it worked for me for a while. But it was a very arbitrary, inflexible way to think about what I do, and what I care about, and what I want to share with you. I don\u2019t want to think that way anymore.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m interested in keeping it real here, and to that end, I should say that since we opened the restaurant, I don\u2019t cook at home as much as I used to. Brandon and I used to cook almost every night, and now that he\u2019s at the restaurant five nights a week, and now that the restaurant is a big part of our everyday, it\u2019s different. When I cook, I make very simple food, dishes that sometimes hardly count as cooking, and many nights of the week, I go to Delancey, so that I can eat with him. I\u2019ve been beating myself up about that, wondering why I got so lazy and when I\u2019m going to go back to being the old, better me. But I\u2019m starting to get it now. The past year has been crazy. Like, completely and totally nutso. Everything is different. Opening a restaurant took every bit of guts and sweat we had, and even some that we didn\u2019t have, and though I am able to say now that I love it, it has changed our lives in every way. Nothing looks the same as it did a year ago, or two years ago, or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">six<\/span> years ago, when I started writing here. I don\u2019t know why, then, I expected my relationship to cooking &#8211; or to this blog, or to anything else &#8211; to stay the same. I love what we do now, and I wouldn\u2019t take back a minute of it. I love what we\u2019re learning, and what we\u2019re creating, and what we\u2019re becoming. Food is at the center of it, the same as always. We\u2019re just looking at it from a different angle, and I\u2019m only beginning to understand how to think and write and tell you about that.<\/p>\n<p>Most of all, I just want to be here more often. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. I want to be in this space &#8211; you, me, looking at pictures, shooting the breeze, swapping ideas, the way we do &#8211; whether I have a recipe up my sleeve or not. And I\u2019m starting today. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Shazam<\/span>! Done.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, I might want to tell you about the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbanspoon.com\/r\/321\/1316175\/restaurant\/Washington-State\/Viking-Drive-Inn-Sprague\">Viking Drive-In<\/a>, in Sprague, Washington, where the sign says they sell BURGERS &amp; SANDS and fingersteaks, whatever those are, and the milkshakes are top-notch.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/323fc-4752840709_e33f3b411c_b1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5489078706075061858\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/323fc-4752840709_e33f3b411c_b1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"679\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThere is a gumball machine near the front door, and in it are fake tattoos. You might get a blue wildcat, for instance, as my friend Sam did, or a shooting star, as I did, and it might stay on your arm for five whole days, weathering even the most vigorous scrubbing, causing some people to think, horror of horrors, that you actually shelled out hard-earned money for a sparkly gold shooting star tattoo. Also: the fake mustaches in the next machine over will make your nose itch. Be warned. The milkshakes are worth it, though. If you find yourself on I-90, maybe on the way to Spokane for a friend\u2019s wedding on a Saturday in late June, listening to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=znB54yk2SJU\">killer Bruce Springsteen track<\/a>, remember: Viking Drive-In.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/352ff-611000091.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5489074690530348898\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/352ff-611000091.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1061\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Or, hey, we could talk about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thestranger.com\/seattle\/chow-bio\/Content?oid=3489020\">my favorite bartender<\/a>! Andrew Bohrer is a genius. And the Mistral Kitchen happy hour is a deal. Tell Andrew what you like, and let him go crazy. It\u2019ll be even better than a milkshake.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/b6a10-610900081.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5489073728456620242\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/b6a10-610900081.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1061\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nOr I might just want to show you a picture. Maybe one of the woman who, a little over five years ago, told the man who is now my husband that he should read this very blog, and who is thus responsible for the fact that we ever met, and who now lives in Seattle, and whom I am happy to call a friend. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Shazam<\/span>! Just like that.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d0a9a-4752841059_58ffe04dd1_b1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5489078716203926514\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d0a9a-4752841059_58ffe04dd1_b1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1008\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7a69a-4752928631_80abd6b1db_b1.jpg\"><br \/>\n<\/a>See you in a couple of days.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve been wanting to put up a new post for ten days, but I haven\u2019t, because I don\u2019t have a recipe to share.
