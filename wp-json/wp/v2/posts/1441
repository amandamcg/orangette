The <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/07\/all-so-pretty.html\">pickles<\/a> are prepped.  We\u2019ve got nine cases of wine and 10 cases of beer lining the walls of our bedroom.  (We had to store them <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">somewhere<\/span>, and we figure one room is as good as another, right?)   My sister just arrived; my brother David lands tonight; and at least a dozen aunts, uncles, and cousins are already in town. It may still be six days away, but really, our wedding has already begun.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a funny feeling.  I hardly know what to say.  To tell you the truth, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually old enough to be doing this.  How on earth did that happen?  I mean, it was only a few days ago, I could <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">swear<\/span>, that I was fumbling through my first kiss in the foyer of my parents\u2019 house.  I can\u2019t <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">possibly<\/span> be old enough to be someone\u2019s <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">wife<\/span>, for crying out loud.  Sometimes Brandon and I look at each other, shaking our heads, and ask,  \u201cCan this really be happening?\u201d Of course it <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">is<\/span>, and happily so, but it\u2019s a lot to wrap a head around.  For me, a wedding means much more than just the starting line for a marriage.  It means a lot of hope, and risk, and change, and growth.  It means a new family, one that starts from just the two of us.  It means walking down the aisle without <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/two-years.html\">my father<\/a>, who has been gone for almost five years now.  I never thought I would do it without him.<\/p>\n<p>Lately I\u2019ve been wondering what he would say about all this.  He would be beaming, I\u2019m pretty sure.  He would have loved to know Brandon.  They would have holed up in his office, thick as thieves, listening to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gene_Krupa\">Gene Krupa<\/a> and talking about beer. It\u2019s strange, but sometimes when Brandon laughs, he sounds <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">just<\/span> like my father.  Sometimes I could swear he were still here, sitting right next to me.  He would like to know, I think, that my mother gave me his wedding ring, and that we had Brandon\u2019s ring made from it, melted down and remolded.  I think he would like that, to be a part of us that way.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s an Alice Walker quote that I love, and that we\u2019ve had printed on the back of our wedding program.  \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">I have learned not to worry about love<\/span>,\u201d it reads, \u201c<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">but to honor its coming with all my heart<\/span>.\u201d  It\u2019s hard not to worry, quite honestly, in our time or anytime, about making this sort of commitment to someone.  But I want to honor Brandon.  I want to honor the part of me that believes.    I want to honor what has come before us.  I want to honor us.<\/p>\n<p>I can\u2019t wait to get started.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/f3079-weddingpreparations117-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/f3079-weddingpreparations117-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5088784840559425634\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>So away I go, friends, away to get married.
