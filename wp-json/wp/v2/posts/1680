Weaned on his mother Martha\u2019s lovingly made baked goods\u2014breads and pastries alike\u2014he knows a worthy one when he tastes it. Over the course of our brief courtship and the friendship that has followed, he has sampled many a sweet from my kitchen, but never that most prized of desserts. We have discussed the merits of various fillings, fats, and degrees of flakiness, but in my home, nary a pie has graced his plate. For my birthday last September, he presented me with <strong>a pie plate, and an implicit challenge<\/strong>. I did not venture a response for nearly six months\u2014until early last week, when, with still-wet eyes and one hand waving goodbye to Brandon, I got a phone call. Saturday would be, Nicho reminded me, <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/03\/no-better-life-than-good-life.html\">his birthday<\/a>, and by way of celebration, he planned an early-evening dinner with friends and a few of his trademark treats: sausages, Swiss chard from the family garden, and a few titanic turkey drumsticks. Ever eager for an excuse to open the oven, I offered a homemade birthday cake\u2014and with a subtle nudge, walked right into baking a birthday pie. So I scratched my head, looked to the skies, and by Saturday afternoon, arrived at rhubarb and orange zest.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Nicho%27s_birthday_06_pie.1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/03\/Nicho%27s_birthday_06_pie.1.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>When in doubt, in between, and in early March, it never hurts to straddle the fence where pie filling is concerned. Apples are last fall\u2019s news; cherries are yet to come; and berries are prohibitively expensive. When we find ourselves somewhere between showers and sunlight, the clouds and the continental plates, the winter and the spring, it\u2019s only fitting to <strong>take the two seasons in hand and stir them together between two buttery crusts<\/strong>. Winter\u2019s oranges are on their way out, but in my kitchen, they send up a sweet, spicy welcome to rhubarb, whose sunny, rakish, rosy stalks are just beginning their seasonal revival. I speak for all of us present on Saturday night\u2014including Nicho, who folded his approval into a goodnight hug\u2014when I assure you that in-between is a very good place to find a successful pie filling, if not a season.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fresh Rhubarb Pie with Orange Zest<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Pies are more about assembly than anything. Once you feel comfortable working with pastry dough, you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to churn out a very pretty pie. Because this one is, really, all about the rhubarb, be sure to choose good, fresh stalks. They should be crisp and firm\u2014never flaccid\u2014and if possible, choose ones that have a deep, pink-red hue: they will yield a more vibrantly colored filling. To make a relatively easy dessert even easier, let the <em>p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e<\/em>\u2014French-speak for buttery pastry dough\u2014sit on the counter at room temperature for at least 20 minutes prior to rolling. I find that it is nearly impossible to roll out when still chilled from the refrigerator, so I wait until it feels just thawed enough to yield gently under the rolling pin. Do <em>not<\/em>, however, allow it to sit until it is fully at room temperature, or you risk having a heavy, not-so-flaky crust.<\/p>\n<p>1 recipe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marthastewart.com\/portal\/site\/mslo\/menuitem.fc77a0dbc44dd1611e3bf410b5900aa0\/?vgnextoid=7ab340ee0c90f010VgnVCM1000003d370a0aRCRD&amp;autonomy_kw=pate%20brisee&amp;rsc=ns2006_m4\">Martha Stewart\u2019s <em>p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e<\/em><\/a><br \/>1 1\/3 cups granulated sugar<br \/>6 Tbs unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>A pinch of salt<br \/>2 \u00bd to 3 tsp freshly grated orange zest<br \/>1 \u00bd pounds fresh rhubarb, washed, trimmed, and chopped into \u00bd-inch slices<br \/>1 Tbs unsalted butter<br \/>Good-quality vanilla ice cream, for serving<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, and position a rack in the lower third of the oven.<\/p>\n<p>On a lightly floured surface, roll one disk of <em>p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e<\/em> into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Gently fit the round of pastry dough into a 9-inch pie plate, pressing it up smoothly along the sides. Trim away excess pastry from the rim. Slip the pie plate into the refrigerator for a few minutes while you prepare the filling.<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, salt, and orange zest, whisking to mix completely. Remove the pie plate from the refrigerator, and sprinkle \u00bc of the sugar mixture over the pastry in the bottom of the pie plate. Heap the chopped rhubarb on top of the mixture. Distribute the rest of the sugar mixture evenly over the rhubarb; it may seem like a lot, but don\u2019t be tempted to skimp. Cut the butter into a few small pieces, and disperse them over the filling.<\/p>\n<p>On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disk of pastry dough into a circle 11-12 inches in diameter. Gently lay the round of dough atop the prepared pie, trimming away excess and then pinching and crimping along the edges to seal the top and bottom crusts together. With a sharp paring knife, gently cut three or four slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Nicho%27s_birthday_06_top_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/03\/Nicho%27s_birthday_06_top_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Place the pie plate on a baking sheet (for ease of transport), and slide it into the oven. Bake for 15 minutes; then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Continue to bake for another 40 minutes to 55 minutes, until the crust is lightly golden and the filling is bubbling up gently through the slits in the top crust. Allow to rest for at least 30 minutes before serving. Serve warm or cold, with vanilla ice cream.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 8 generous servings<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Early March: it\u2019s an in-between time, not really winter and not quite spring.
