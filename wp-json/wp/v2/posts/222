In recent years, she\u2019s done a lot of playing around with other grains, too, grains that tend to intimidate me but luckily not Megan, and about ten days ago, her first cookbook,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Whole-Grain-Mornings-Breakfast-Recipes-Seasons\/dp\/1607745003\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=whole-grain%20mornings&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1389390306&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Whole-Grain Mornings<\/i><\/a>, was published by Ten Speed Press. You might have already heard of it &#8211; Heidi, for one, just <a href=\"http:\/\/www.101cookbooks.com\/archives\/california-barley-bowl-recipe.html\" target=\"_blank\">mentioned<\/a>\u00a0Megan\u2019s California Barley Bowl &#8211; but as soon as I tried her method for making steel-cut oatmeal, I knew I had to write about it.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/72bd9-9f7a03521.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/72bd9-9f7a03521.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I\u2019ve been making oatmeal the same way forever: boiling three cups of water and half a teaspoon of kosher salt, stirring in a cup of steel cut oats, lowering the heat so that the pot just simmers, and letting it go like that until the cereal has thickened. It gets the job done, and it also has the benefit of being easy to make with one hand while I have a 25-pound person wrapped around my hip like a monkey. My oatmeal is good &#8211; I originally typed &#8220;my oatmeal is food,&#8221; and that\u2019s also true &#8211; but Megan\u2019s oatmeal is better.<\/p>\n<p>It starts with an ingenious (<i>ingenious!<\/i>) idea: you toast the oats in butter. (<i>!<\/i>) This is, admittedly, somewhat difficult to do with one hand while you have a 25-pound person wrapped around your hip like a monkey, and if you saw me on my first time attempting it, you would also have heard a lot of cussing (me) and whining (me and June). But if you have two hands, it\u2019s no big deal. It\u2019s no more difficult than boiling water &#8211; about three parts water and one part milk, to be specific &#8211; which is what you do while the oats are toasting. You\u2019ll know the oats are ready when the kitchen smells like you\u2019re baking shortbread, and then you scrape the toasted oats into the pot of simmering water and milk and let the mixture roll slowly along for about half an hour, until the oats are plump and you\u2019ve got soft, creamy porridge. I recommend that you top it with maple syrup.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/2125f-9f7a03551.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/2125f-9f7a03551.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s the oat-toasting or the ratio of water to milk, or both, but Megan\u2019s is a very special oatmeal. \u00a0It\u2019s velvety, velvet punched up with chewy oats. It\u2019s perfectly salted and perfectly not-sweet. The entire recipe, which feeds four, has only a tablespoon of butter and a cup of milk, which I consider very reasonable, but it feels rich, satisfying. I might even call it\u00a0<i>luxurious<\/i>, a word that was never intended for oatmeal.\u00a0As soon as we\u2019d finished our first batch, I made a second &#8211; this time at night, after June was in bed, so that I had full use of my limbs &#8211; and I can report that it reheats very well. It\u2019s even good at room temperature, which probably sounds revolting, but I like it, so be nice. \u00a0I made my third batch last night, and June and I took down half of it this morning. \u00a0June likes hers with applesauce and plain yogurt, eats a full adult-size portion, and then mooches from my bowl when hers is gone.<\/p>\n<p>Megan, it\u2019s a keeper. xx<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Megan\u2019s Steel-Cut Oatmeal<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Whole-Grain-Mornings-Breakfast-Recipes-Seasons\/dp\/1607745003\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=whole-grain%20mornings&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1389390306&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Whole-Grain Mornings<\/a><\/i>, by Megan Gordon<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2014-01-10T23:26:00-05:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/222?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>The original version of this recipe includes vanilla extract and raisins, but I\u2019m a plain-oatmeal person, so what follows is the basic portion of the recipe. \u00a0I hope Megan will forgive me for being boring.<\/p>\n<p>I should note that both Megan and I use Diamond Crystal brand kosher salt, which tastes less salty than Morton brand.

Adjust the heat to maintain a slow simmer, and partially cover the saucepan. \u00a0Cook, stirring occasionally to prevent clumping and scorching, until the mixture has thickened and the oats are soft, 25 to 30 minutes. The cereal will still be quite loose at this point, but don\u2019t worry; it will continue to thicken.
