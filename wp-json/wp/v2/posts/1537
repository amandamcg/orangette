I meant to tell you about it then, but I was knee-deep in my book proposal, and it was pretty much all I could do to keep feeding, bathing, and clothing myself, much less write something adequate to such a lovely, lovely city.   I fell hard for Portland.  It\u2019s my new favorite. Oh, Portland, from your old brick train station to your free light rail, your river, your bridges, and that pair of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shopdolcevita.com\/shoes.aspx\">shoes<\/a> (cute <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">and <\/span>comfortable!) that leapt from your storefront into my suitcase, you got me, hook, line, and sinker.  And that was before Pearl Bakery, even.<\/p>\n<p>A reader of this site had told me about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pearlbakery.com\">Pearl Bakery<\/a>, but I had no idea just how bewitching it would be.  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Be-witch-ing<\/span>.  I went there three times in three days, friends.   I took extra-long lunch breaks.   I made it happen.  I hoofed across town in high heels.  I almost missed my train.  I <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">had<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> <\/span>to have my daily <span style=\"font-style:italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">bouchon<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/01\/Bouchons_side.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>So named \u2013 <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">en fran\u00e7ais<\/span> \u2013 for their faint resemblance to a champagne cork, these little chocolate cakes could have easily kept me in Portland indefinitely, if I hadn\u2019t had that pesky return ticket.  Dense and delicate, with a fine, tight crumb, they were unusual in nearly every way \u2013  and unusually good. Tinted a deep, reddish brown from plenty of dark chocolate, they sat <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">somewhere between brownie, scone, and day-old chocolate cake<\/span>, and were studded throughout with semisweet chips. Some could call their texture a tad dry, I guess, but once on the tongue, a mouthful melted almost instantly \u2013 at which point, of course, I started pawing for more.  This could have been a big problem back in Seattle, as you can imagine, had I not discovered that the recipe for <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">bouchons<\/span> was waiting on my cookbook shelf.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first to say it, but thank heavens for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidlebovitz.com\/\">David Lebovitz<\/a>.  Within the folds of his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Great-Book-Chocolate-David-Lebovitz\/dp\/1580084958\/sr=1-1\/qid=1168913252\/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1\/104-8162456-4377564?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Great Book of Chocolate<\/span><\/a> lies the recipe for Pearl Bakery\u2019s <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">funny little beauties<\/span>, as told to him by pastry chef Lee Posey.  And, as with the book\u2019s other recipes \u2013 I\u2019ve tried a good handful now \u2013 this one <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">works<\/span>.  I made just a few tweaks \u2013 substituting regular-size Ghirardelli chips for the mini ones indicated, mainly because I can\u2019t find a worthy brand of the latter, and using a mini popover pan instead of a regular muffin tin \u2013 but otherwise, David, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">wow<\/span>.   Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>With a shape not unlike a pert, stocky mushroom and a <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">deliciously<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">craggly, cracked top<\/span>, these humble-looking cakelets are chocolate to the core \u2013 which is how, I think, we all should strive to be.  They\u2019re tailor-made for a chilly afternoon with a girlfriend, or boyfriend, and a good, strong cup of coffee.  I can also tell you that they fit quite nicely into a Sunday evening with a couch, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0433383\/\">DVD<\/a>, a bottle of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.warre.com\/otima\/index.htm\">tawny port<\/a>, my man, and my mother, who was in town for another installment of wedding planning.

I didn\u2019t think they could get any better, but they did.  And then we all had seconds.  They\u2019re real keepers, right up there with celery root.<\/p>\n<p>P.S.  I hardly know what to say.

I have made them that way with very good results, but on my most recent go, I chose to try them instead in my new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cooking.com\/products\/shprodde.asp?SKU=141294\">mini popover pan<\/a>.  [Big ups<em><\/em> \u2013 man, my slang is <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">wicked <\/span>today \u2013 to my very petite cousin Katie and her man Andrew.  You guys did very well in the Christmas gift department.]  That way, I guessed, their shape would more closely resemble the ones at Pearl Bakery, which are taller and narrower than a typical muffin \u2013 more \u201ccork-like,\u201d if you will.  As it turned out, I guessed right.  So, friends, if you have a mini popover pan, now\u2019s your chance to use it.  But if not, no problem: just use a muffin tin.<\/p>\n<p>Also, for the chocolates, be sure choose good ones \u2013 these are <em>chocolate<\/em> cakes, you know, so don\u2019t skimp.<\/p>\n<p>3 \u00bd ounces bittersweet chocolate, such as Valrhona Guanaja 70%, chopped<br \/>3 \u00bd ounces unsweetened chocolate, such as Scharffen Berger 99%, chopped<br \/>1 \u00be cups cake flour<br \/>1 \u00bd Tbs unsweetened cocoa powder<br \/>Pinch of salt<br \/>\u00bd pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br \/>1 \u00bc cups granulated sugar<br \/>4 large eggs, at room temperature<br \/>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, such as Ghirardelli<\/p>\n<p>Adjust a rack to the middle position, and preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.  Grease a 12-well muffin pan or mini popover pan with butter or cooking spray.<\/p>\n<p>In a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, melt the bittersweet and unsweetened chocolates together, stirring occasionally.  When the chocolates are just melted, remove the bowl from the heat and set it aside.<\/p>\n<p>Sift the flour, cocoa, and salt together into a medium bowl.  Set it aside.<\/p>\n<p>In the bowl of an electric mixer (or a mixing bowl), beat the butter and sugar until very light and fluffy.  Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.  Beat in the melted chocolate until well incorporated.  Using a rubber spatula or spoon, stir and fold in the dry ingredients in three additions.  Add the chocolate chips and stir to combine.  The batter will be quite thick.<\/p>\n<p>Divide the batter between the wells of the muffin tin or popover pan.  Bake the cakes for 15-18 minutes, or until they still feel quite soft in their centers when pressed lightly with your index finger.  Do not overbake them, or they will be dry.<\/p>\n<p>Remove the pan from the oven, and allow to cool on a rack for about 10 minutes.  Carefully remove the cakes from the pan and cool completely before eating or storing.  (I find that they taste best when they\u2019ve been allowed to rest for a couple of hours.  The chocolate flavor needs time to settle and ripen a bit.  Oddly enough, they really don\u2019t taste all that great when they\u2019re warm.)<\/p>\n<p><em>Note<\/em>: The <em>bouchons<\/em> are best eaten on the day they\u2019re made, but they\u2019re still very good the next day.  Store them at room temperature in an airtight container.  I also froze a few and let them defrost at room temperature, and they were quite tasty.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 12 cakes<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You guys are to be commended.
