We got a dog! &#8211; and realized with a start that I am not at all ready for summer to end.  The calendar has somehow rolled around to August, which means that we have approximately one month, maybe six weeks, before the real Seattle rains arrive, and I haven\u2019t yet had a swimsuit on.  I haven\u2019t even rolled up my jeans and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">waded<\/span>.  I don\u2019t know what is wrong with me.  Also, picnics. I have a quota to fill.<\/p>\n<p>So, in an effort to promote a picnic or two, I planned to tell you today about something called Deep Dish Fruit Pie.   It\u2019s a recipe that I found in my grandmother\u2019s recipe box while I was in Oklahoma, written on an index card in her loopy handwriting.   I\u2019m not sure why she called it a pie, because it\u2019s more of a cobbler, or what some might refer to as a \u201cdump cake.\u201d (I <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">love<\/span> that name.)  Either way, I made it yesterday, and it was terrible.   It was too sweet, for one, but even worse, it was oddly jiggly, almost puddingesque, and the batter separated so that the fruit was bobbing in melted butter, lethargic and forlorn, like tiny buoys in an oil spill.   I wasted four cups of blueberries on that sorry mess.  FOUR.  It was <span>so<\/span> sad.<\/p>\n<p>However, as I scooped said mess into the compost, I remembered something else, another something I had meant to tell you about.  And glory be, as my grandmother would say, this something was even <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">better <\/span>for a picnic.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/6357b-polapotatoes1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/6357b-polapotatoes1.jpg?w=297\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5233415677969280082\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Under ordinary circumstances, I am not much of a potato person.  I like them as much as anybody, but to tell you the truth, when it comes to thinking about what to make for dinner, I tend to forget that they exist.  But earlier this summer, I fell hard for the <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/06\/in-its-frilly-finest.html\">Hasselback potato<\/a>, as you might remember, and it left me feeling sort of soft and susceptible.  So when I saw a recipe in <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Gourmet<\/span> for fingerling potatoes braised in a skillet and tossed with fresh herbs, I couldn\u2019t help but start to daydream a little, and then clip it posthaste.<\/p>\n<p>The principle is simple.  You simmer the potatoes, peeled and halved, in a skillet with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic, and water to cover, and when they feel tender to the prick of a knife, you reduce the liquid to a loose glaze, bang in a generous palmful of herbs, and eat.  Thanks to their gentle bath in the salted water and oil, the potatoes get silky and rich and full of flavor &#8211; not unlike a regular boiled potato, but better.  I ate them warm that first night, with scrambled eggs and blanched green beans tossed in olive oil, and the next day, I ate them cold, right out of the fridge.  The third day, on a whim, we threw them in a tote bag and took them to the lawn at Seattle Center, and they were <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">unspeakably<\/span> good that way, outdoors, on a blanket, eaten at room temperature with a little extra salt.  We also had some cheese, crusty bread, yellow wax beans, and spiked lemonade in a water bottle, but I don\u2019t think any of those swayed my opinion in the slightest.  Not even the lemonade.  Scout\u2019s honor.<\/p>\n<p>The original recipe calls for finishing them with chives and tarragon, but I opted for chives and parsley instead.  Parsley is always classic, right?  It\u2019s like red lipstick.  Anyway, tarragon, I find, has a sneaky way of making things taste absolutely awful.  And while we\u2019re being honest here, I guess I should also tell you that peeling fingerling potatoes is a royal pain.  That doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t make these, of course, because you <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">should<\/span>.  I\u2019m just saying.  Go slow and make a meditation of it, and it can be quite pleasant.  Whatever you do, don\u2019t try to do it in a hurry.  Take it from me: I got a nick in my thumbnail today because of these.  But I also got a good excuse for a picnic, so I don\u2019t really mind.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Fingerling Potatoes with Chives and Parsley<\/span><br \/>Adapted from <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Gourmet<\/span>, July 2008<\/p>\n<p>These would be delicious with almost anything: roasted chicken (served hot or cold), eggs any style, salmon (served hot or cold), you name it.<\/p>\n<p>1 \u00bd lb. fingerling potatoes, such as Russian Banana<br \/>1 \u00bd cups water<br \/>3 Tbsp. olive oil<br \/>1 large garlic clove, pressed<br \/>\u00bd tsp. salt<br \/>A few grinds of black pepper<br \/>3 Tbsp. chopped chives<br \/>1 Tbsp. chopped Italian parsley<\/p>\n<p>Peel the potatoes, and halve them lengthwise.<\/p>\n<p>Combine the potatoes, water, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper in a nonstick 10-inch skillet.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/dfaf7-polapotatoinskillet1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/dfaf7-polapotatoinskillet1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5233379590509347666\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Place the skillet over medium-high heat, and bring to a simmer.  Cover, reduce the heat slightly, and continue to simmer briskly, shaking the skillet occasionally, until the potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes.
