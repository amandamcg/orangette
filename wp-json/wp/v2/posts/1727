The trappings of modernity are nice, but when the call comes, sign me up for <strong>an afternoon of foraging and flitting about the garden with a good girlfriend and a thicket of blackberry bushes to tear at our hands<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/08\/Blackberry_picking_Kate_text_yes1.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So it was that a few days ago I slipped on a pair of dirty jeans, sped fifteen minutes east of Seattle,<a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Blackberry_picking_blueberries_text_yes.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/08\/Blackberry_picking_blueberries_text_yes.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a> and joined Kate in laying waste to her parents\u2019 backyard. She greeted me at the door and, being the master of all things fishnets to frump, quickly outfitted me for the task at hand. Offering me an empty plastic yogurt tub, she instructed me to hang it from my neck<a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Blackberry_picking_hands_text_yes.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/08\/Blackberry_picking_hands_text_yes.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a> by a kitchen-twine yoke, and then she led me to the family\u2019s communal hat-rack, where she handed me a floppy blue sun-hat two sizes too small. Needless to say, I was nobody\u2019s centerfold, but minutes later, <strong>in the bushes down by the water, telling juicy stories through the leaves, with the sun hot on my back, blackberry juice under my fingernails, and my wrists red and bramble-bitten,<\/strong> I couldn\u2019t have been<a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Blackberry_picking_close_yes.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/08\/Blackberry_picking_close_yes.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a> happier. We dished our way through to the blueberry bushes, pausing only for a quick shriek or two when I nearly fell into a hard-to-see hole, but no matter\u2014I didn\u2019t spill a berry. In fact, there were plenty left for Kate to steal\u2014sneaking them into her bucket in mid-sentence\u2014and for carrying home later and stewing into a <strong>silky purple jam<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>I suppose we could opt next time for something a bit more dainty, perhaps sans sunscreen, sun-hats, and stains. Tea and scones sounds a lot more tempting, anyway, now that I\u2019ve got a cupboard full of blackberry jam. But something tells me that a few days will find the berry bushes again full and heavy, the green vines dripping with beans, the plums nearly falling from their stems, and the two of us babbling over full buckets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Italian Family Jam<\/strong><br \/>Adapted from Bruna and Margot<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/08\/Blackberry_picking_jars_text_yes.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>A few years ago, Kate\u2019s older sister <a href=\"http:\/\/www.margotknight.com\/margot.html\">Margot<\/a> spent a year and a half in Italy, where she befriended\u2014and was all but adopted by\u2014a local couple. Aside from finding a good bicycling partner in the husband, she also found a very skilled kitchen companion in his wife Bruna, who offered up this classic recipe for plain-and-simple Italian country jam. Margot has since sent myriad different fruits through its formula\u2014apricots to peaches, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries\u2014all with tooth-achingly good results. On an average weekend morning when <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/02\/bagnette-breasts-and-excuse-to-eat.html\">the whole family<\/a> is at home, they\u2019ll go through a good jar of the stuff on toast, waffles, pancakes, or eager fingers.<\/p>\n<p>These days, it seems as though fancy jams are everywhere, with a new herb or spice thrown in every day. I love the<em> idea<\/em> of so much nuance and complexity, but in all honesty, I don\u2019t often find myself itching to try the stuff. When it comes to jam, I want nothing fancy\u2014just fruit, a squeeze of lemon, and enough sugar to set the jar sparkling. I want a clean, concentrated flavor, the essence of the fruit heightened, undisguised. And luckily, this sort of jam is astoundingly easy to make at home\u2014no fussing with packets of pectin, no cheesecloth, no enormous pots and fears of contamination. Bruna\u2019s method is quick and confidence-inspiring, a process that\u2019s both immensely sensual and appealing practical. The same goes for the finished product. Dress it up or play it down, however you choose: spoon it over homemade ice cream, dot it daintily on a scone, or give it a British accent by layering it into a trifle; pair it with nut butter on homemade bread, fold it into plain yogurt, or hide it inside <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/09\/on-not-getting-killed-learning-to-be.html\">a<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/10\/when-in-jam.html\">cake<\/a>. But first, call your girlfriends, and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Robert_Herrick_%28poet%29\">gather ye berries while ye may<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>1 kg (2.2 pounds) fresh fruit, preferably berries or stone fruits <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">(if using the latter, pit and cut into chunks, and if using peaches or nectarines, peel them as well)<br \/><\/span>\u00bd kg (1 pound) granulated sugar, or to taste <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">(if fruit is perfectly ripe, you may need a bit less)<br \/><\/span>Juice of \u00bd lemon<\/p>\n<p>Combine the fruit, sugar, and lemon juice in a large pot or Dutch oven, and let macerate at room temperature for two hours, stirring occasionally.<\/p>\n<p>While the fruit is resting, prepare the jars. Preheat the oven to 225 degrees Fahrenheit, and wash a half-dozen 8-ounce jam jars (the type with two-part sealable lids: a flat disk and a ring) under hot, soapy water. Place the jars\u2014but <em>not<\/em> the lids\u2014in the oven. Wash the lids under hot, soapy water, and place them on a clean dish towel to dry. The jars will need to stay in the oven for at least 20 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Place the pot containing the fruit over medium-high heat, and bring the mixture to a boil. Boil the jam for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. As it cooks, the jam will give off a pale-colored foam that will rise to the surface. Use a wooden spoon to skim off as much of the foam as possible (and save it, if you like; it\u2019s wonderful with plain yogurt). If you leave the foam in the pot, your finished jam will be cloudy.<\/p>\n<p>After 30 minutes, remove the pot from the heat. Using tongs, remove each jar from the oven, and using a ladle to scoop the hot jam from the pot, fill the jars to within \u00bc inch of the top. Wipe off the rims of the jars with a clean, dry paper towel to remove any errant drips. Place the lids on top of the jars, and screw them down finger-tight (firmly, but not too tight). A batch of jam should fill anywhere between 4 and 6 jars, depending on the fruit, water content, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Fill a large, deep pot with water, and bring it to a boil; it should be large enough to hold all of the jam jars, and the water will need to be deep enough to reach up to half an inch below their rims, or higher. When the water is boiling, use tongs to carefully place each of the jars, standing upright, in the boiling pot. Boil for 15 minutes; then turn off the heat. Allow to sit for a minute; then remove the jars with the tongs and allow them to cool completely on a dish towel. When they are cool, press each lid lightly to make sure it has sucked down and sealed. If necessary, tighten the lids. Store in a cool, dry place.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 4-6 8-ounce jars <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cForget our walk; I\u2019ve got a better idea,\u201d Kate announced with a little squeal. \u201cThere are blackberries everywhere.
