I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve answered the question very clearly when it\u2019s been put to me, because ha ha haaa haaaaaaa I do NOT do it all. I don\u2019t think anyone does, of either sex. I hardly remember what I\u2019ve said said on the topic &#8211; maybe something about the importance of surrounding yourself with supportive people, people who believe in what you do and want you to do it? That\u2019s very important. But I\u2019ve been thinking about it today, and I want to add something: take a look at this blog. It\u2019s a good barometer. I do not have an editorial calendar, and I do not post on a schedule. This blog is the place where I come to practice writing, to keep myself limber, and I do it because I love it. If I\u2019m in a good rhythm with posting here, it\u2019s because Delancey and Essex are miraculously free of crises for a little while, June is sleeping like a champ, and I\u2019m probably staying up later than I should. If I\u2019m posting less, it\u2019s because those non-blog parts of my life are keeping me busy, and in the hours when they\u2019re not keeping me busy, I am dead and\/or eating popsicles.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/169f9-dpp_00131.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/169f9-dpp_00131.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I can\u2019t believe that it\u2019s already almost July. It makes me want to hunker down at home and get my fill of very ordinary summer things, like riding our bikes to the farmers\u2019 market (with June in the bike trailer wearing a tiny helmet and Brandon and me singing, <i>La la la la la, la la la la la, helmet song<\/i> to the tune of &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vSYadh2xmcI&amp;feature=kp\" target=\"_blank\">Elmo\u2019s Song<\/a>,&#8221; because la la la la la, wearing a helmet is SO FUN!), buying those very expensive and very good raspberries from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.localharvest.org\/growing-washington-at-alm-hill-gardens-M20590\" target=\"_blank\">Alm Hill<\/a> and eating them all at once, taking June to the neighborhood <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/P-Patch\" target=\"_blank\">P-Patch<\/a> to look for garden gnomes, and drinking a nightly Campari and Tonic. (I like a standard Campari and Soda, but I might like this even more. Try it! Niah, our bar manager at Essex, told me yesterday to try garnishing it with a castelvetrano olive, but I was halfway through my glass last night before I remembered; sorry, Niah.) June was sick last week, so I made a chicken soup, but mostly, the kind of cooking I want to do right now is not really cooking, but basic chopping. Some scrambled eggs, at most, and lots of big salads with crunchy radishes, cucumbers, and feta. And then a popsicle, which is little more than a smoothie, frozen.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/deae4-dpp_00351.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/deae4-dpp_00351.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"640\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>When Delancey first opened and I was still in the kitchen there, we had a popsicle on the menu, and I once wrote about it here, in <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2010\/07\/for-popsicle.html\" target=\"_blank\">a raspberry yogurt version<\/a>. That was four years ago, and because I\u2019m a creature of habit, I\u2019m still making them: with strawberries in June, raspberries in July, blackberries in August, you see where I\u2019m going. I\u2019ve made the strawberry version twice in the past two weeks, and because strawberries (&#8220;dobbies,&#8221; as June says) are already starting to peter out, I wanted to hurry up and write about it. If you haven\u2019t yet made popsicles this summer, get on it. My popsicle guru Stephanie, of the beautiful site <a href=\"http:\/\/www.3191milesapart.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">3191 Miles Apart<\/a>, has lots of other <a href=\"http:\/\/www.3191milesapart.com\/?p=4272\" target=\"_blank\">popsicle<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.3191milesapart.com\/?p=1691\" target=\"_blank\">ideas<\/a>, if you then want to really run with it.<\/p>\n<p>This strawberry version uses less sugar than the raspberry one, and it also uses less yogurt, so it has a particularly bright, clean strawberry flavor. You start by tossing the berries with sugar and a few drops of kirsch or vodka &#8211; the alcohol will help to keep the pops from freezing too hard, without interfering with their fresh fruit flavor &#8211; and then letting them sit until their color deepens and they release lots of dark, glossy juice. Then you scrape it all into the blender with yogurt and a little lemon juice, zizz it, and then pour it into molds. (Don\u2019t forget to taste it: it should taste a little sweeter than you\u2019d ideally like, because it will taste less sweet once it\u2019s frozen. That\u2019s the case for anything that you eat very cold.) The resulting pops are electric pink, a color usually reserved for bougainvillea and nail polish, only this time, you lucky thing, you get to eat it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Strawberry Yogurt Popsicles<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/158008219X\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=158008219X&linkCode=as2&tag=orangette-20&linkId=2RPAASM6AOIBIZJG\" target=\"_blank\">The Perfect Scoop<\/a><\/i>, by David Lebovitz<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2014-06-23T19:33:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/142?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>A word about popsicle molds: I use <a href=\"http:\/\/coldmolds.com\/index.php\/pop-molds\/product\/41-cmp4210\" target=\"_blank\">these silicone ones<\/a>, which I learned about from the book <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1607743906\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1607743906&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=D74SRCKETJDQ5J3Y\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Art Desserts<\/a><\/i>, by Caitlin Freeman. (And high five to my talented friend <a href=\"http:\/\/leahrosenberg.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Leah Rosenberg<\/a>, who called my attention to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/ci_23132267\/recipe-zurier-ice-pop\" target=\"_blank\">Zurier Pops<\/a> recipe and inspired me to get these molds. Leah, when I bought strawberries last week, I <i>meant<\/i> to make Zurier Pops, but I got lazy. But I still will. I swear.) Anyway, if you\u2019re using silicone molds like mine, which are soft and pliable, don\u2019t forget to set the molds on a sheet pan before filling them! That way, they\u2019ll be easy to transport to the freezer. And don\u2019t forget to insert the popsicle sticks into the mold before filling, either. It all sounds obvious, but you never know.<\/p>\n<p>I also have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Norpro-423-Ice-Pop-Maker\/dp\/B0002IBJOG\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=popsicle%20molds&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1403542718&amp;sr=8-2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=ELB7VLU4D37UMIGN\" target=\"_blank\">this popsicle mold<\/a>, but we loaned it to a friend (ahem, Katie), so I haven\u2019t been able to try it yet. I\u2019ll report back. I have a feeling it\u2019ll be better for very liquid-y pops than the silicone molds, which might leak. Lastly, if you\u2019re using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Luminarc-6-Piece-Drink-Islande-2-25-Ounce\/dp\/B005EEYKQC\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=vodka%20shot%20glass&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1403408105&amp;sr=8-8&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=BU6MQMWLKTFVMFLM\" target=\"_blank\">vodka shooter glasses<\/a>, which is what I used when we served popsicles at <a href=\"http:\/\/delanceyseattle.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Delancey<\/a>, you\u2019ll want to pour the mixture into the glasses; freeze them for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the mixture begins to set; insert the popsicle sticks; and then freeze them until they\u2019re hard. To serve, briefly run the sides of the glass under tepid water to loosen the popsicle, and gently twist the stick as you lift.<\/p>\n<p>I should tell you that these popsicles are not as smooth, texture-wise, as churned frozen yogurt \u2013 or, for that matter, as commercial popsicles. They\u2019ll be a little icy, even if you use the kirsch or vodka. The texture doesn\u2019t bother me.

Set aside at room temperature for about an hour, stirring occasionally.<\/p>\n<p>Scrape the strawberries and their liquid into the jar of a blender, add the yogurt and lemon juice, and process until smooth. If you want to remove the seeds \u2013 though I usually just leave them be \u2013 set a strainer over a bowl (or other vessel) with a pour spout. Press the mixture through the strainer to remove seeds.
