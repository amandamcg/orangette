Every way, the window of time in which they were just right, tender but not yet reduced to mush, was narrow at best. Occasionally I hit it, but often not. So I gave up on dried beans for a while, which is fine, actually, because canned beans are great. I can think of worse fates than going to my grave a crappy bean cooker &#8211; for instance, living an entire life without doing &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NiwcOaaRo1Y\" target=\"_blank\">Islands in the Stream<\/a>&#8221; at karaoke.

But dried beans are cheaper than canned, much cheaper, and I wanted to get it right.<\/p>\n<p>My friend Winnie Yang helped me, though she has no idea that she did. In 2007, she left <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seriouseats.com\/user\/profile\/Winnie%20Yang\" target=\"_blank\">a comment on a Serious Eats post about cooking beans<\/a>, and in her comment, she described her favorite method, which comes from the great <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/John-Thorne\/e\/B000AQ1J0Y\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=O5UJTX2S25N7NNPN\" target=\"_blank\">John Thorne<\/a> and his great book\u00a0<i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0865475644\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0865475644&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=3YUUGQTI4CMKW263\" target=\"_blank\">Pot on the Fire<\/a><\/i>. Thorne cooks beans\u00a0in their soaking water, and in a very low oven, not on the stovetop. As Winnie put it, &#8220;His method produces peerless beans . . . the tenderest, most velvety beans just barely held together by the skins. There&#8217;s not too much danger of overcooking, and you get optimum flavor.&#8221; I bookmarked it in my browser, calling it &#8220;Winnie&#8217;s Pot Beans,&#8221; and then I completely forgot about it. \u00a0But I found it again recently, after a long stretch of dried bean avoidance, and I am now a believer. It is How I Do Dried Beans. Incidentally, here is Winnie, looking as sprightly and triumphant as I now feel every time I eat my own cooked-from-dried beans, only she&#8217;s not in a kitchen but instead walking in the woods on a vacation we took with a couple of friends five years ago this month, to pick apples and watch the leaves fall and generally cook our brains out in a rental house in upstate New York.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-7542 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/937600281.jpg\" alt=\"93760028\" width=\"1024\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/937600281.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/937600281-662x439.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/937600281-870x577.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve dug up that photograph, here are a few others from that trip, because it feels good to see them again, and because the trees outside my window look almost identical today.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-7544 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/937500171.jpg\" alt=\"93750017\" width=\"1024\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/937500171.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/937500171-662x439.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/937500171-870x577.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7545 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/94520001-smaller1.jpg\" alt=\"94520001-smaller\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1009\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/94520001-smaller1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/94520001-smaller1-507x500.jpg 507w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/94520001-smaller1-1015x1000.jpg 1015w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/94520001-smaller1-870x857.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-7546 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/937700041.jpg\" alt=\"93770004\" width=\"1024\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/937700041.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/937700041-662x439.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/937700041-870x577.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My kitchen&#8217;s Formica is a sad, wonky shadow of the Italian tile in that upstate kitchen, but it serves its purpose.

But I don&#8217;t know how much that matters. John Thorne soaks his for eight to twelve hours. However long you soak them, soak them. It makes a difference. But <i>do not<\/i> throw out the soaking water; it is not, how should I say it, infected with future &#8220;digestive distress.&#8221; As Thorne puts it, and he in turn paraphrases <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/la-bio-russ-parsons-staff.html\" target=\"_blank\">Russ Parsons<\/a>: &#8220;Neither cook nor eater can do much to reduce the problem of flatulence, except to eat <i>more <\/i>beans. (The more you eat, the better your digestive flora can handle them.)&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you do instead: you put a strainer over a medium saucepan, and you drain the beans into the strainer, catching their soaking water in the pan. You bring the soaking water to a boil. Meanwhile, you dump the beans into a Dutch oven, season them with salt and olive oil and other things, if you&#8217;d like, and then pour the boiling soaking water over the beans, clamp on the lid, and put it into a 200-degree oven for four to five hours. After four hours, you check the beans for doneness, and if they&#8217;re not done, you keep cooking them until they are. While they cook, you need only stir them once an hour, or less, or whenever you think of it, and make sure they are covered with liquid. The rest of the time is yours.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-7548 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/F7A61801.jpg\" alt=\"F7A6180\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/F7A61801.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/F7A61801-662x441.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/F7A61801-870x579.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<p>It occurs to me that this might sound like a long, slow, possibly tedious process. But because it <i>is<\/i>\u00a0long and slow, I feel comfortable leaving the house, even for a couple of hours at a go. I live for danger! Large beans, like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ranchogordo.com\/collections\/heirloom-beans\/products\/royal-corona-bean\" target=\"_blank\">corona beans<\/a>, can take up to eight hours, meaning that I can very literally cook while I sleep. And because the oven temperature is so low, and gentler than most stoves, it&#8217;s almost impossible for the beans to, <i>poof<\/i>,\u00a0dissolve into mush while you&#8217;re not looking. They&#8217;re silky, plump, and most of all, <i>consistent<\/i>, each bean cooked properly through.

I\u2019ve used this method with all kinds of beans \u2013 cannellini, pinto, corona, flageolet, little heirloom beans whose names I don\u2019t know \u2013 and it works with all of them. I don\u2019t even measure my beans anymore, or any of the seasonings. You can wing it. [<em><strong>Updated to add<\/strong><\/em>: a couple of readers have called to my attention an important fact of which I was unaware: <strong>red kidney beans must be boiled briskly<\/strong> before consuming, because they contain a toxin. Thus I cannot advise this gentle oven method for red kidney beans. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/Food\/FoodborneIllnessContaminants\/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook\/ucm071092.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Go here<\/a> for more information.) A few notes:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">1. I\u2019m writing the recipe below mostly as John Thorne intended, but you should know that I generally only season my beans with olive oil, salt, and sometimes red pepper flakes. That\u2019s all. Do as you wish.<br \/>\n2. When you cook the beans, they should be barely covered with water, so that the water and bean juices reduce to a delicious, thick broth. (In the photo above, I used a little too much water, actually, and they were soupier than I intended. No real harm done, though.)<br \/>\n3. Also, even though I just went on and on about the sadness of an overcooked bean, well\u2026 when I cook them this low, slow, gentle way, I actually like to cook them a little past done. My friend <a href=\"http:\/\/www.millys-kitchen.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\">Olaiya<\/a> taught me to do that, because by the time they cool down, they will have firmed up ever so slightly, and they\u2019ll be perfect. So when I think the beans are done, I don\u2019t immediately take them out of the oven; I leave them for an extra 15 minutes or so, to take them just a tiny bit further.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd pound dried beans (<i>not <\/i>red kidney beans; see headnote above), picked over, washed, and soaked for 12 to 24 hours in water to cover amply\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bc cup olive oil\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed under the side of a knife\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 or 4 sage leaves\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd teaspoon black pepper\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd teaspoon red pepper flakes\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0F. Drain the beans, reserving the soaking liquid. Remove and discard any beans that have failed to rehydrate. (They will be wrinkled and ornery-looking.) Put the beans and seasonings, everything but the soaking liquid, in a Dutch oven or similar vessel. Pour the bean soaking liquid into a saucepan and heat to boiling. Add enough of this liquid to the bean pot to barely cover its contents, reserving any remaining liquid. Cover the pot, and put the beans in the oven. Cook at this very low heat \u2013 they should never come to a boil \u2013 until they are nicely done, about 4 to 5 hours. Check the water level periodically over the first four hours, adding the remaining bean liquid (and then plain boiling water) if needed to keep the beans covered.<\/p>\n<p>Serve the beans hot, warm, or at room temperature, or use them in another dish. June likes hers plain, and she drinks the bean broth that\u2019s left in the bowl after the beans are gone. We like to eat pinto or other brown beans with grated sharp cheddar and hot sauce.
