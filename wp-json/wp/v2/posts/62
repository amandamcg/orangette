One day, while we were discussing some poem or other on the topic of dreams, he told us that, on a couple of occasions and with much practice, he\u2019d been able to control his dreams by getting into a very focused, hypnotic state at bedtime. We were riveted. I tried it myself a few times, never with any luck. But I still think about it sometimes, especially when I\u2019m working on a book and find myself dreaming in words, writing in my sleep. My mother reminded me the other day that I even named my first car after Peter Fortunato, a totally mortifying fact that I should probably keep quiet but this sentence is already almost finished and well, there you go. He made an impression.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/edcbb-_f7a4535-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/edcbb-_f7a4535-21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"640\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I went to Quartz Mountain again the following summer, and again in 2000 and 2002, when I was in my early twenties, to work as a counselor and an assistant to the writing faculty. By then, I wasn\u2019t writing anymore, not outside of school assignments, and I felt detached from even the idea of writing. It had been my teenage thing, and I was done with it and glad. I don\u2019t know why I thought to go back to Quartz Mountain, but there I was, working for and with poets\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.georgebilgere.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">George Bilgere<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ruthschwartz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruth Schwartz<\/a>. If they noticed what a cynical shit I was, they said nothing. It wouldn\u2019t be for another couple of years, until I started this blog, that I would start to sort it out, get out of my own way, and return to writing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/96f93-_f7a45281.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/96f93-_f7a45281.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I got to go back to Quartz Mountain last week, this time as a teacher myself. Each fall, OAI offers a Fall Arts Institute, a series of four-day workshops for adults, and Oklahoma public school teachers automatically receive\u00a0<i>full scholarships<\/i>(!). I taught a workshop called Writing Life, on personal narrative and memoir. It was my fifth time at Quartz Mountain, but only my second visit since the rebuild was completed, a new lodge and library and, across a foot bridge, a large performing arts facility at the foot of the mountain. I wanted to go back to the amphitheater where we always gave a big reading on the last day &#8211; barefoot, as was the tradition &#8211; and to the pavilions along the lake where the dancers and photographers and actors held their classes. I was elated, and I was terrified. Nobody hears the words\u00a0<i>Oklahoma arts retreat<\/i>\u00a0and thinks, <i>Carnegie Hall of the Great Plains!\u00a0<\/i>or,\u00a0<i>if I can maaaake it there, I can make it annnywhere!<\/i>, but being asked to teach at Quartz Mountain felt bigger, more significant, than anything else I\u2019ve achieved. Bigger than ten years of blogging, writing two books, or having a baby, even a baby who weighed nine pounds. I got to go back to the beginning.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/fbba7-_f7a44641.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/fbba7-_f7a44641.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<p>People come to Quartz Mountain ready to work hard.

I usually come to a couple of hours later, jittery and light-headed, and find that I worked through dinner.
