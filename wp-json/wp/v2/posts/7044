Having now crossed over to the other side of that illusion, I can report that, whoa, hey, it&#8217;s an illusion! June is no fool, but she&#8217;s content to play along as necessary. Yesterday, in the car on the way home, she informed me, apropos of nothing, that she has no blood.

It&#8217;s not to say that I trust <i>only<\/i> those few, but theirs are the recipes that most consistently appeal to me, make me feel confident, and in the end, make me proud. The late <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2014\/04\/that-word-is-eat\" target=\"_blank\">Judy Rodgers, for instance, is one of those cooks<\/a>. Another is Alison Roman. I don&#8217;t know her, and she doesn&#8217;t know me, but she was a senior food editor at <i>Bon App\u00e9tit<\/i>, and I first saw her name in the magazine, attached to a lot of good recipes. That\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2015\/03\/doing-it-right\" target=\"_blank\">raspberry-ricotta cake<\/a> I wrote about last March, that was hers. She&#8217;s now moved over to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/food\" target=\"_blank\">BuzzFeed Food<\/a>, but in any case, wherever she is, she knows her way around a lemon.<\/p>\n<p>This cake uses lemon in two forms: the grated zest, which you rub into sugar to infuse and perfume the batter, and the juice, which you make into a syrup to pour over the finished cake. \u00a0There&#8217;s also coconut in two forms, though its flavor is more subtle: there&#8217;s coconut oil in the cake itself, and coconut flakes on top, which get toasted and sticky with the lemon syrup. What you wind up with is a texture and heft a lot like pound cake, but with a heady whack of lemon and the satisfying chew of coconut. June and I ate it for breakfast, and I took another slice after lunch. My mother, who loves a lemon dessert, came over a couple of days later and stumbled upon what was left of the loaf, still moist, when she went to put away an upturned aluminum mixing bowl on the counter and found that I&#8217;d co-opted it as a cake dome. She raved about it. This one&#8217;s for her.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Coconut-Lemon Tea Cake<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\"><i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.shortstackeditions.com\/collections\/single-editions\/products\/vol-13-lemons-by-alison-roman\" target=\"_blank\">Lemons<\/a><\/i>, by Alison Roman (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.shortstackeditions.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Short Stack Editions<\/a>, Volume 13)<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2015-10-01T21:47:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7044?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>Three notes before we get started: I tend to have regular whole-milk yogurt on hand, not Greek yogurt, and I used what I had. I haven\u2019t had this cake when made with Greek yogurt, but I can imagine that it could only be better. It was plenty moist and tender with regular yogurt. Also, re: the mildly fiddly step of rubbing the sugar and lemon zest together with your fingers, I know I know I know, but do it. It infuses the sugar with lemon flavor, and lemon flavor is what this cake is all about. Lastly, because coconut oil is very hard and crumbly at room temperature, I find it difficult to measure by volume. So I measure it by weight, scraping and chipping it from the jar onto the scale, and <em>then<\/em>\u00a0I melt it.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd cups (210 grams) all-purpose flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 teaspoons baking powder\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00be teaspoon kosher salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bc cup (250 grams) sugar, divided\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00be cup (210 grams) whole-milk Greek yogurt (see note above)\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd cup (80 grams) coconut oil, melted\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 large eggs\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd cup (35 grams) unsweetened coconut flakes\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Grease a (9\u201dx5\u201d-ish) loaf pan lightly with cooking spray or butter, and line it with parchment paper. Grease that too, while you&#8217;re at it. (Though trying to grease paper with butter can be an infuriating, wrinkle-filled endeavor, so I won&#8217;t blame you if you skip it.)<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, and kosher salt.<\/p>\n<p>In a large bowl, rub 1 cup of the sugar with the lemon zest until the sugar is fragrant and yellow and smells, well, like you just rubbed a lemon in there. Whisk in the yogurt, coconut oil, and eggs. Add the flour mixture, and stir just to blend.<\/p>\n<p>Scrape the batter into your prepared pan, and smooth the top. Sprinkle coconut flakes over the surface, and bake until the top of the cake is golden brown, the edges pull away from the side of the pan, and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. (I found that the coconut flakes were browning before the cake was done, so I tented the cake loosely with foil after about 45 minutes.)<\/p>\n<p>While the cake bakes, combine the lemon juice and remaining \u00bc cup of sugar in a small saucepan, and bring it to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, just until the sugar has dissolved. Turn off the heat, and keep the mixture warm. When the cake is done, brush the top with the syrup; then return the cake to the oven and bake for 5 minutes more to re-crisp the coconut. Remove the cake from the oven, and cool completely before serving.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 1 standard-sized loaf<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A couple of weeks ago, I got up earlier than usual, while the light was still blue, and baked a cake.
