It\u2019s what I was always told. They say you have to sprinkle the cornmeal into boiling water in a particular way, like a rain shower, and that you have to stir <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">constantly<\/span>. Rumor has it, if you put down your spoon and step away, or if you try to do anything that is not constant stirring, your polenta will go lumpy, irretrievably lumpy, to spite you. I remember my mother making polenta once, sometime in the late 80s. She had eaten it in a restaurant, served soft with sauteed mushrooms on top, and she decided to try it at home. She studied up in all the right places, and then she did as she was told: she stood at the stove and stirred, and stirred, and stirred, for over an hour. She was intense. She was <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">devoted<\/span>. And it was beautiful: the pure flavor of corn, only softer and richer, more deeply satisfying. But I don\u2019t remember her ever making it again.<\/p>\n<p>I tried making polenta once, in college. I didn\u2019t know that the possibility of lumps in one\u2019s corn gruel could cause a person real anxiety, but it did for me. It\u2019s not that making polenta is actually difficult; it\u2019s just that, because of all the dos and don\u2019ts that come with it, I was sure that I was doing something wrong. I felt like my dinner and I were teetering on the edge of some precipice, a precipice over an abyss of lumps, and I didn\u2019t know if we were ultimately going to fall, or how I could tell if we were falling, or how long I was going to have to stand there, teetering, by which I mean stirring, before we were rescued. (I\u2019m prone to nightmares.)<\/p>\n<p>So I started buying polenta in tubes, a simplified situation that requires only slicing. But it was never very good, and certainly not as good as freshly cooked soft polenta. After a while, I stopped eating much polenta at all, except in restaurants. But you don\u2019t find it much on menus anymore &#8211; or not as often as you did in the 80s, when it had its big break &#8211; so, basically, what I\u2019m trying to say is that I have been living a life devoid of polenta for quite some time. Whether or not that counts as a life is a reasonable question.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e8747-polapolenta1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5442035652414495442\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e8747-polapolenta1.jpg?w=298\" alt=\"\" width=\"1211\" height=\"1220\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Anyway, I\u2019d been thinking about that a lot lately, and then I saw, in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">New York Times<\/span>, that Mark Bittman <a href=\"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9D01E7DD1739F934A25751C0A9669D8B63\">was writing about polenta<\/a>. I decided that the time had come. I gathered up a few recipes, including Bittman\u2019s, and I compared them: some had you fuss until Forever, some promised that it was quick and easy, and some even used an oven method that requires no human intervention at all. What I decided on was something in between, the polenta from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FZuni-Cafe-Cookbook-Compendium-Franciscos%2Fdp%2F0393020436%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1267071792%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Zuni Caf\u00e9 Cookbook<\/span><\/a>, by Judy Rodgers.<\/p>\n<p>If I haven\u2019t made this clear, I\u2019m going to say it now: I totally love this book. It might actually be my favorite cookbook, and those are big words to throw around. I had been ignoring its polenta recipe for reasons cited above, but I should have had more faith, because it is brilliant. BRILLIANT.<\/p>\n<p>Zuni has had polenta on its menu for a long time, and it\u2019s perfect: served soft, with Parmesan, mascarpone, or nothing. I always wondered how they made it in a restaurant setting, where each cook is working on a thousand things at once, and how they served it so quickly, without any kind of wait or delay or allowance for stirring time. The answer, it turns out, is two-fold.<\/p>\n<p>First, Judy Rodgers doesn\u2019t(!) adhere(!) to the constant stirring rule. I love her. You need to stir often enough, she says, to keep the polenta from sticking or scorching, but you don\u2019t need to hover over it. Using a heavy-bottomed saucepan is important, and you want to keep the heat gentle, so that the polenta bubbles only occasionally, slowly, like lava. If you stir every five minutes or so, you should be fine. Second, and this is the brilliant part, brilliant brilliant brilliant: after the polenta has cooked, you hold it in a double boiler, or in some sort of contraption over simmering water, for anywhere between thirty minutes and a few hours. Judy Rodgers says that this holding period is key, that it allows the cornmeal to swell and soften even more, making it especially creamy. And it does. Not only does it make for a better, more tender, lighter polenta, but it\u2019s also so <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sensible<\/span>. So humane. So handy! It means that, if you want to, you can make your polenta, your brilliant polenta, a couple of hours ahead and keep it hot until you want it.<\/p>\n<p>If I were you, I would make it immediately, for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Whichever comes first.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Zuni Caf\u00e9 Polenta <\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FZuni-Cafe-Cookbook-Compendium-Franciscos%2Fdp%2F0393020436%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1267071792%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Zuni Caf\u00e9 Cookbook<\/span><\/a>, by Judy Rodgers<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2010-03-06T23:55:00-05:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/860?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>I use Bob\u2019s Red Mill brand <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bobsredmill.com\/corn-grits_polenta.html\">corn grits polenta<\/a>, which is not fancy, but it works fine.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            5 cups water\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 cup coarsely ground polenta\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            About 2 tsp. kosher salt, or to taste\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Unsalted butter, to taste\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Parmigiano-Reggiano, for serving (optional)          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Bring the water to a simmer in a 2-quart saucepan. Whisk or stir in the polenta, then stir until the water returns to a simmer. [I did this step, and the steps that follow, with a whisk.] Reduce the heat until the polenta only bubbles and sputters occasionally, and cook, uncovered, for about 1 hour, stirring as needed, until thick but still fluid. If the polenta becomes stiff, add a trickle of water. Taste. Add salt and a generous dose of butter. [I used 2 teaspoons of kosher salt and about 2 tablespoons of butter.]<\/p>\n<p>Transfer the polenta to a double boiler set over simmering water. Wrap the lid tightly in plastic wrap (*see note) and cover the polenta. Allow the polenta to rest that way for at least 30 minutes \u2013 or up to a few hours, depending on your schedule. If you don\u2019t have a double boiler, you can make a close approximation by setting the saucepan containing the polenta on a small, ovenproof ramekin centered inside a wider, deeper pot, and surrounding it with barely simmering water. Cover the pan as directed above.<\/p>\n<p>Serve hot. If you want, grate some Parmigiano-Reggiano on top, though I like mine plain.<\/p>\n<p>Note: The plastic wrap doesn\u2019t seem like great idea to me, but I\u2019m not sure. Heating plastic can cause it to release chemicals, but since this plastic wrap isn\u2019t actually touching the food, is it safe? I followed the recipe as directed, but I wanted to raise the question. If you\u2019re worried, maybe skip the plastic\u00a0wrap? Or instead, try placing a sheet of parchment over the saucepan, under the lid?<\/p>\n<p>Another note: This polenta would also be delicious with a spoonful of tomato sauce or meat sauce, or with some sliced sausage. You could also serve it with some sort of braised beef or pork. I had polenta topped with duck ragu and a fried egg at <a href=\"http:\/\/flourandwater.com\/\">Flour + Water<\/a> in San Francisco, and it was out. of. control.<\/p>\n<p>The last note: If you have leftover polenta, spread it about 1 inch deep in a lightly oiled baking dish. Allow it to cool, and then refrigerate until you\u2019re ready to roast, grill, or fry it.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 4 to 8 servings<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have been, for quite some time, intimidated by polenta.
