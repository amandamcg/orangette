I dutifully followed her recipe for a \u201cChocolate Malteser Cake,\u201d but the resulting offense tasted neither of chocolate nor of malt, and its crumb was a mousy brown, dull and rubbery. Before the cupcakes so much as saw my icing spatula, they were rerouted to the trashcan. Given my <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/11\/handy-life-strategy-dinner-included.html\">previous statements about Ms. Lawson<\/a>\u2014we\u2019re no longer on a first-name basis\u2014you can well understand my need to sulk.<\/p>\n<p>But because I still wanted dessert, I began to slowly prepare myself for a second go-round. I did a little research, thumbed through a cookbook or two, and then I took down the trusty accordion file of recipes that sits atop my refrigerator. To start anew, I figured, sometimes a girl must retreat to familiar territory, so I pulled out an old, <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/09\/on-not-getting-killed-learning-to-be.html\">tried-and-true<\/a> recipe for chocolate cake, and I tried, tried again.<\/p>\n<p>The cupcake itself, I decided, didn\u2019t need to contain malt; what I wanted was <strong>a good, stand-alone chocolate cake<\/strong>, something that needs no adornment. In the same way that a good ice cream sets the tone for a milkshake, this cake would be a solid base on which to build my malted flavor. From there, I could fuss with the frosting until I had something creamy, toasty, and tinted with cocoa, <strong>a flavor that tasted as though it could be slurped through a straw<\/strong>. And <em>that<\/em>, dear reader, is success for you.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Chocolate_malt_cupcakes_crumb.0.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/05\/Chocolate_malt_cupcakes_crumb.0.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>With two types of chocolate and a half-cup of buttermilk, these cakes bake up to a pretty shade of brunette, with a rich, tender crumb that shines under the light. Capped with a lazy swirl of soft, malted frosting, it\u2019s like a milkshake, but with a more satisfying chew. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Chocolate Malted Cupcakes<\/strong><br \/>Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/recipe_views\/views\/101275\">Epicurious<\/a> and Nigella Lawson\u2019s <em>Feast<br \/><\/em><br \/>This cake recipe is very delicious and very, very delicate. Its tender crumb makes it one of the best cakes I know of, but it\u2019s almost too fragile for a cupcake. Plan to eat these with a plate nearby, and with a napkin to erase the evidence.<\/p>\n<p><em>For cupcakes:<\/em><br \/>1 ounce good-quality semisweet chocolate, finely chopped<br \/>\u00bd cup hot brewed coffee<br \/>1 cup granulated sugar<br \/>\u00be cup plus 1 Tbs unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>\u00bd cup unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch process)<br \/>Generous \u00bd tsp baking soda<br \/>\u00bc tsp baking powder<br \/>Scant \u00bd tsp salt<br \/>1 large egg<br \/>\u00bc cup canola oil<br \/>\u00bd cup buttermilk<br \/>\u00bc tsp pure vanilla extract<\/p>\n<p><em>For frosting:<\/em><br \/>2 cups powdered sugar<br \/>1 Tbs unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch process)<br \/>1\/3 cup malted milk powder, such as Carnation or Horlicks<br \/>9 Tbs (1 stick plus 1 Tbs) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br \/>2 Tbs boiling water<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Line 12 cups of a muffin tin with paper liners.<\/p>\n<p>Place the chocolate in a medium bowl with the hot coffee. Let stand, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth and opaque.<\/p>\n<p>In another medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt, and whisk to combine well.<\/p>\n<p>In a large bowl, beat the egg with an electric mixer until it is pale yellow in color, about a minute or two. Slowly add the oil, buttermilk, and vanilla extract, beating to combine well. Slowly add the melted chocolate mixture, and beat to thoroughly combine. Add the dry ingredients, and beat on medium speed until the batter is just combined. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the sides of the bowl and briefly fold the batter to be certain that all of the dry ingredients are incorporated.<\/p>\n<p>Divide the batter evenly among the 12 prepared muffin cups. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Cool the cupcakes for 15 minutes in the pan; then gently transfer them to a rack to cool completely. They are <em>very<\/em> delicate and tender, so take care.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Chocolate_malt_cupcakes_crooked.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/05\/Chocolate_malt_cupcakes_crooked.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>When the cupcakes are cool, make the frosting. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the powdered sugar, cocoa, and malted milk powder, and process to mix well. Add the butter, and process to blend. Stop the motor, and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Then, with the motor running, add the water. Process briefly, until the frosting is smooth. Frost the cupcakes in loose swirls, and serve.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 12 cupcakes<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If there\u2019s one flavor that I hate, it\u2019s the aftertaste of failure.
