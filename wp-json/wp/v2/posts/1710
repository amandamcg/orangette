And anyway, if we really get down to semantics, <em>stewed<\/em> prunes aren\u2019t dried fruits anymore. They\u2019re <strong>soft, swollen, gushy pockets of heady, sweet-tart juice<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Stewed_prunes_slice_text2.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/10\/Stewed_prunes_slice_text2.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>I like to think of prunes as plums that have been bettered by hardship, plums made wiser by old age and wizening, and I consider myself lucky to have been schooled in the simple art of stewing from an early age. <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/04\/for-french-toast-master-on-his-76th.html\">My father<\/a>, a fan of cook-while-you-sleep breakfasts, used to load up a late-night saucepan with prunes, water, and thin slices of orange and lemon, bring it to a boil, cover it, turn off the heat, and let it sit until morning. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fsis.usda.gov\/\">Food Safety and Inspection Service<\/a> would likely look askance at such a method, but it did make ours a relatively happy, mainly healthy, pro-prune household.<\/p>\n<p>Today I prefer a method that\u2019s a little more conventional but every bit as effortless: a short, gentle simmer over low heat, with no stirring, poking, or prodding required. You\u2019ll know that your prunes are properly stewed when <strong>an almost liqueur-like aroma wafts out of the saucepan<\/strong>. The fruit should slump on the spoon, and its skin should <strong>yield to the tooth with a gentle, dainty pop<\/strong>. Its silky, juicy pulp should be both <strong>warming and wintery<\/strong>, a deep, round, heartening flavor that\u2019s delicate but deathly serious.<\/p>\n<p>If I have my way, even the most hard-boiled of prune skeptics will be stewed into submission.<\/p>\n<p>*Thank you, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidlebovitz.com\/archives\/2005\/10\/#000129\">David Lebovitz<\/a>, for believing in prunes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stewed Prunes with Citrus and Cinnamon<\/strong><br \/>Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/tg\/detail\/-\/1573220388\/qid=1130388209\/sr=1-1\/ref=sr_1_1\/103-2914635-2649464?v=glance&amp;s=books\"><em>Tomato Blessings and Radish Teachings<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>When I wanted to recreate the flavor of my father\u2019s overnight stewed prunes, I turned to a little feel-good cookbook-cum-self-help-book by Edward Espe Brown, Zen monk and author of several well-known vegetarian cookbooks. Brown treats his prunes as simply as possible, and rightly so. To my palate, prunes are the loveliest of dried fruits: they lack the shrill, high-pitched sweetness of raisins and the sticky, cloying sugar of dates, and their low, dark flavor has more depth than, say, a dried apricot. These stewed prunes get additional nuance, too, from thin slivers of citrus fruits, which go into the pot bitter peel and all. They\u2019re delicious warm, with thick, Greek-style plain yogurt, or atop a bowl of oatmeal, dabbled over ice cream, or\u2014as I\u2019ve been known to do it\u2014cold, straight off the fork, from the fridge.<\/p>\n<p>1 orange, OR 2 small tangerines, OR 1 small orange and \u00bd a lemon<br \/>1 pound pitted prunes, preferably organic<br \/>1 cinnamon stick<\/p>\n<p>Cut the citrus fruit in half vertically, and then slice it thinly, peel and all. Place the slices in a medium saucepan with the prunes and the cinnamon stick, and add water to cover. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, and cook over medium-low heat for about 30-45 minutes, until the prunes are quite tender, the citrus slices are soft and glassy, and the liquid in the pan is caramelly. Remove the cinnamon stick and serve, or store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week.  I find that they&#8217;re actually better after a little rest, so I try to make mine a day or so before I want to eat them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the English language, there are only a handful of phrases that come with their own built-in laugh track, and sadly, \u201cstewed prunes\u201d is one of them.
