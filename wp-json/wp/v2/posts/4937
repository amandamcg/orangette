I was once fifteen years old, lying on my bedroom floor in a black t-shirt and a pair of too-big men&#8217;s pants that I bought at a thrift store for fifty cents, listening to &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KIJGlTu5sEI\" target=\"_blank\">Find the River<\/a>&#8221; and sobbing without knowing why.

Last night, we went to hear <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alison_Bechdel\" target=\"_blank\">Alison Bechdel<\/a> speak at Town Hall. I was first introduced to her work when I was writing <i>A Homemade Life<\/i>\u00a0and my friend Kristen loaned me her copy of <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0618871713\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0618871713&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=FOYD3G3MDJIE3EZI\" target=\"_blank\">Fun Home<\/a>.<\/i>\u00a0I didn&#8217;t know why she gave it to me, and I&#8217;d never read a book in cartoon format, but I quickly understood that, as much as it&#8217;s about Bechdel&#8217;s coming out, it&#8217;s also about the relationship between a father and a daughter, which is what I was attempting to write myself. And <i>Fun Home<\/i>\u00a0is spectacular: honest, direct, funny, raw, and also deeply loving. Bechdel seems to be much the same in person, and I grinned like an idiot through her entire talk last night about writing, art, and creativity, and the complexities of family. Also! She mentioned Richard Scarry as an early influence, and HELLO, WOW, is my life right now ever full of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0553520598\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0553520598&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=KG6XBLD2KBCOXYEH\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Scarry<\/a>.
