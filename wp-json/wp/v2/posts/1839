You, dear reader(s), are very courageous to come along with me. You and I may well disagree on some of the items that follow, and it may well get tense and awkward. Or we may agree, but sharing might prove too difficult. And <strong>one never knows what I might decide to like next<\/strong>, so we\u2019ll both be constantly on the edge of our seats. But I won\u2019t let that stop me, and you shouldn\u2019t either.<\/p>\n<p>And so, favorite things. Because I, like Talking Heads, \u201cdream of cherry pies, candy bars, and chocolate chip cookies\u201d\u2014or at least things in the favorite sweets and desserts category\u2014I begin Part One of this journey with:<\/p>\n<p>-Dark chocolate, preferably between 70 and 85% cocoa mass<br \/>-Dark chocolate with whole toasted almonds from A la Petite Fabrique (12, rue Saint-Sabin, 75011 Paris)<br \/>-Chausson aux pommes, preferably from Au Levain du Marais (32, rue de Turenne, 75003 Paris, or at the corner of blvd. Beaumarchais and rue du Pasteur-Wagner in the 11th)<br \/>-A baton of dark chocolate wedged into the doughy center of a hunk of good baguette<br \/>-Graham crackers, slightly soggy with milk<br \/>&#8211;<a href=\"http:\/\/splendidtable.publicradio.org\/recipes\/dessert_plum.html\">Marian Burros\u2019 Plum Torte<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Original_plum_torte_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/08\/Original_plum_torte_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>-Moist, dense cakes containing ground almonds, almond paste, and\/or pure almond extract<br \/>-Vegan chocolate cupcakes (deep dark chocolatey cake with a thick hard shell of bittersweet chocolate over the top) from Whole Foods in Seattle<br \/>-Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, made by me<\/p>\n<p>And because you\u2019ve indulged me thus far, I now grant you a recipe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies<\/strong><br \/>Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/cookie.allrecipes.com\/az\/BstBigFtChwyChcltChipCki.asp\">this recipe<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/08\/Oatmeal-Chocolate-Chip.1.jpg\" height=\"340\" width=\"418\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I love plump, rustic-looking cookies, and these make me happy indeed. They\u2019ve got plenty of toothsome texture from the oatmeal and <strong>a little salty edge<\/strong> that heightens the flavors of the butter and chocolate. While I\u2019m not faint of heart, these cookies almost too rich when warm, so I find that they\u2019re best at room temperature or even slightly chilly from the freezer.<\/p>\n<p>2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>\u00bd tsp baking soda<br \/>\u00bd tsp salt<br \/>\u00be cup unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled<br \/>1 cup packed brown sugar<br \/>\u00bc cup granulated sugar<br \/>1 Tbs best-quality vanilla extract<br \/>1 egg<br \/>1 egg yolk<br \/>1 \u00bd cups best-quality semi-sweet chocolate chips<br \/>1 \u00bd cups quick-cook oats, or rolled oats zizzed in a food processor for a few seconds<\/p>\n<p>1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease cookie sheets with cooking spray or line them with parchment paper or silicone baking mats (I use the latter, which keeps the cookies from spreading too far and makes for easy clean-up).<\/p>\n<p>2. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter and brown and granulated sugars until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk, mixing until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients, working until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips and oats by hand, using a wooden spoon. Chill dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to one hour. Use a table knife to scoop and press dough into \u00bc-cup measuring scoops, and plunk the mounds onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be three inches apart.<\/p>\n<p>3. Bake cookies for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned. [Mine often take longer than 15 to 20, but start there and then eyeball it.] Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cook completely. Eat.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it is this hot, it can be difficult to use complete sentences. Everything must be short, easy to blurt out between gulps of cold water.
