The cook we hired to help Brandon with the pizzas didn\u2019t show up for his first official day of work &#8211; the day before our first pre-opening dinner &#8211; which has left only Brandon and me in the kitchen. That means that I do my work at my station, run over to his station to help top and finish pizzas, and then run back to my station again. This has not left much time for photography &#8211; or breathing, or thinking, or sleeping. If I ever see our no-show again, I am going to break his face. Mark my words. In the meantime, Brandon has burned his business card in the pizza oven. Do not cross us, people.<\/p>\n<p>But as of this evening, we\u2019ve found two people to work part-time until we find a full-time cook. We\u2019re going to sleep better tonight.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/879b4-polabillystomatoes1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5365995423533783922\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/879b4-polabillystomatoes1.jpg?w=293\" alt=\"\" width=\"903\" height=\"926\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nAnd not only will we sleep better, but I will dream of tomato salads. I have three boxes, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">three whole boxes<\/span>, of these beauty queens sitting at my station. These particular specimens, called Big Beef, were grown by Billy Allstot, a farmer in Tonasket, Washington. Billy grows the best tomatoes at the farmers\u2019 market, and they cost a small fortune, and we\u2019re so proud to serve them. For our first pre-opening dinner, I used them in a composed salad, along with fingerling potatoes, green beans, hard-boiled egg, anchovy, and shallot vinaigrette. The second night, I cut them into thick slices and topped them with fresh corn cut from the cob, cherry tomatoes (again from Billy), basil, and more shallot vinaigrette.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/77741-polasunflowers1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5365995053082091890\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/77741-polasunflowers1.jpg?w=248\" alt=\"\" width=\"1035\" height=\"1250\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nMy mother was here for our first dinner, and as it turns out, she is an absolute champ of a sous chef. She also bought sunflowers for the bar, and on our night off, she treated us to beers and bourbon sours. She was in town for five days, and I don\u2019t know how we could have made it without her. I cried when she left. I have never been as tired as I am right now. I never even <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">knew<\/span> that I could be so tired.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/35bf4-polapopsicles1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5365986163960736562\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/35bf4-polapopsicles1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1062\" height=\"858\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nBut I never seem to get tired of making raspberry yogurt popsicles, which is good, because I\u2019ve already made almost two hundred of them. I\u2019m in love. They\u2019re one of two items on our soft opening dessert menu, along with bittersweet chocolate chip cookies with gray salt. The popsicles up there, the ones in the photo, were from one of my test batches, made in small glass juice jars. At the restaurant, I make them in vodka shooter glasses. I\u2019ve only broken two glasses so far, and our dishwasher has broken three. It\u2019s not a terrible record, I don\u2019t think. We\u2019re figuring it out. Not just popsicles, but everything.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/3b1f5-polacookiesonwhite1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5365986157934598674\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/3b1f5-polacookiesonwhite1.jpg?w=249\" alt=\"\" width=\"1037\" height=\"1248\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nI can\u2019t say much more tonight. It\u2019s almost midnight, and I\u2019m still at the restaurant, and I\u2019ve got tomatoes to go home and dream about.
