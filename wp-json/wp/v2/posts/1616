Oh <strong>sweet, sweet, slate-colored autumn<\/strong>, I think I love you. For now, at least.<\/p>\n<p>Only a few weeks ago, when August gave way to September, I wasn\u2019t sure that I was ready. With the exception of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/06\/salad-days.html\">one<\/a>\u2014okay, maybe two\u2014heat waves, Seattle had a pretty mild summer, and though I did whine a bit about the heat when it actually came, I wasn\u2019t convinced that I\u2019d gotten my fill. But apparently, bossy Mother Nature had gotten hers, and so while Brandon and I were away in Oklahoma and safely out of range, she bought fall a first-class ticket to Seattle. Last week, it rained, it rained, and it rained some more. It was gray and gloomy. I even got out a coat. And though it surprised the heck out of me, I sort of liked it.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s only natural, I guess. We humans seem to crave variety in nearly everything, from our meals to the color of our underwear, so the seasons should be no exception. Summer was nice, but so, in its own way, is September. I\u2019m hard-wired to think so. Either that, or this Rainy City has really sunk its teeth into me. Whatever the reason, I kind of like <strong>sleeping with socks on<\/strong>, and waking up to a chilly room. I like turning on the heat and hearing the furnace whirr and thrum. The evenings are perfect for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/248703402\/in\/set-72157594274393000\/\">taking walks<\/a> right now, in the few weeks before night comes at five o\u2019clock sharp. I love <strong>the smell of smoke from a chimney nearby\u2014the ne plus ultra of seasonal scents<\/strong>\u2014and the way that the dim, grayish daylight makes everything look brighter: the leaves, the last few flowers, even signs and billboards. I\u2019m a total sap, I know. I\u2019m a real sucker for this fall stuff. But tell me this: who doesn\u2019t love sweaters and scarves and boots and layers? He who denies the lure of fall is a big, fat liar.<\/p>\n<p>So, even if the sun <em>does<\/em> happen to be shining today in Seattle, it is with pleasure that I swoon a little in the direction of fall, and that I make in its honor my favorite salad of the season.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/3654\/533\/1600\/Chicken_salad_text_again_2.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/09\/Chicken_salad_text_again_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>In my kitchen, <strong>every climatic change calls for its own signature salad<\/strong>: <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/04\/spring-sliced-and-straight-from-bowl.html\">a sliced one for spring<\/a>, with endive, cilantro, radishes, and feta; <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/06\/salad-days.html\">a cooling one<\/a> for summer, with lime and garlic; and for winter, a festive <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/11\/handy-life-strategy-dinner-included.html\">red cabbage slaw<\/a>. As for fall, it wants warm flavors, I think: a cool-weather green, some olives, pine nuts, and peppers, and a few homemade croutons rubbed with plenty of garlic. And since any girl worth her salt knows that roasted chicken is a good way to show affection\u2014whether for a season or a someone\u2014it\u2019s an obvious addition. Tossed together <strong>in an oven-warmed bowl<\/strong>, the elements melt softly into each other: the arugula around the chicken, the pine nuts into the olives, the oil and vinegar over it all. Eaten by the window, and maybe with slippers on, it is late September sung in the key of salad. I could eat this every night. For now, at least.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><strong>Warm Chicken Salad with Arugula, Olives, and Pine Nuts<\/strong><br \/>Inspired by <em>The Zuni Caf\u00e9 Cookbook<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Chicken_salad_top_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/09\/Chicken_salad_top_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>I first made this salad two years ago, and I have never forgotten it. Every time I roast a chicken, it is in the back of my mind, and now, with any luck, it will be in the back of yours too. It\u2019s a delicious way to dispose of leftover chicken, but it\u2019s also tasty enough to warrant roasting one to begin with. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what I did this weekend: I roasted the bird on Friday, ate a couple of pieces, and then socked away the rest for salads on Saturday and Sunday. It was heaven, and since Brandon doesn\u2019t eat meat, I got to hog it all for myself. [<em>Oink, oink<\/em>!] Something tells me that, so long as arugula is available, there will be several more weekends like this.<\/p>\n<p>Before you begin, a couple of notes. First, I have left the quantities somewhat vague. This salad is very malleable, so feel free to play with ratios of various ingredients. But be sure, if you can, to start with all ingredients at room temperature. (If you\u2019re a cheater like me, you can warm the chicken for a few seconds in the microwave.) As for the arugula, it is quite fragile, so make sure that it is very fresh and free of wilty leaves. I used baby arugula, but if you can find the more sturdy, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cuisine-vegetarienne.com\/index.php?in_id=83\">wild-looking<\/a>, mature type\u2014which seems to be more common in Europe, I\u2019ve noticed\u2014use that. I wish I could find it more often around here.<\/p>\n<p>1 crusty chunk of country bread or baguette<br \/>Olive oil<br \/>1 large garlic clove, peeled and halved lengthwise<br \/>1 handful of coarsely shredded meat from a roasted chicken<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/02\/bagnette-breasts-and-excuse-to-eat.html\">Red wine-mustard vinaigrette<\/a><br \/>1 Tbs pine nuts<br \/>6 Ni\u00e7oise olives, pitted and halved<br \/>1 generous handful of arugula<br \/>1 small handful of very thin slices from a yellow or red bell pepper<br \/>Sea salt<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.<\/p>\n<p>Tear the bread into a handful of irregular croutons. Brush them with olive oil to coat, spread them on a sheet pan, and toast until golden at the edges, about 6 minutes. Cool the croutons slightly; then rub them the garlic while still warm. Be as thorough as you are fond of garlic. Turn off the oven.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, toss the chicken with a bit of the vinaigrette\u2014just a touch, for moisture and flavor\u2014and set aside.<\/p>\n<p>Place the pine nuts and olives in an ovenproof serving bowl\u2014I use my favorite round, vintage Pyrex bowl\u2014and place it in the turned-off oven for about 2 minutes to warm through. Carefully remove the bowl from the oven\u2014it may be hotter than you think\u2014and add to it the arugula and the peppers. Toss with vinaigrette to coat lightly but thoroughly. Add the chicken and the croutons, crumbling some of the latter over the bowl to let garlicky crumbs fall into the salad. Add a little more vinaigrette, and toss gently to coat. Taste, and add more vinaigrette or salt if necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Serve promptly\u2014straight from the bowl, if you like.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 1 serving<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Okay, so, remember what I wrote about summer?
