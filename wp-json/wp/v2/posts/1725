The yard was in full bloom, with tomatoes of every shape and size, lettuces, Romano beans, herbs, potatoes, corn, and carrots, not to mention a gnarly swath of raspberry bushes, beds of dahlias and daisies, and pear, plum, and apple trees. And between a trellis of beans and the garage, the lamb, aptly dubbed \u201cBriquette,\u201d spun quietly over the coals in time to twangy country music playing from a nearby radio.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Lamb_roast_swimmers_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/08\/Lamb_roast_swimmers_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>With the smell of so much meat in the air, it wouldn\u2019t be quiet for long. Guests trickled in, bearing swim suits and bowls full of food, and while Briquette bronzed, they worked up an appetite in the lake, splashing around on surfboards and in sailboats. Meanwhile, I whet my own with a few sips of ouzo\u2014and began planting the seeds for <strong>a slow but steady movement toward the groaning buffet tables<\/strong>. <a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Lamb_roast_tomato_mozz_text1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/08\/Lamb_roast_tomato_mozz_text1.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>There, under the shade by the side of the house, bowls of pasta salad jostled with pickled vegetables, which butted up against roasted beets with fresh herbs, noodles, heirloom tomatoes and fresh mozzarella, hummus, olives, Vietnamese pancakes filled with ground meat and bean sprouts, baskets full of litchis, pies, plum puddings, compotes, and cookies. And then, of course, there was <strong>the lamb, rich and earthy and ringed with fat<\/strong> from seven months of grazing on lush local grass.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/08\/Lamb_roast_carving_text2.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>We dispersed ourselves around the yard, sitting on the ground or leaning here and <a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Lamb_roast_CM_plate_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/08\/Lamb_roast_CM_plate_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>there, balancing paper plates on our knees and fending off the chickens, who\u2019d been, much to their delight, liberated from the hen house to root in the loose dirt of the garden.

True, it may sound a bit odd\u2014off-putting, even\u2014but once tasted, you won\u2019t think twice. Brandade is rich, garlicky stuff, creamy and savory, the flavor of the cod having been tempered and soothed by salting and drying. The mousse is spread atop a layer of slow-simmered tomato sauce inside a puff-pastry shell, and when baked, it puffs lightly and turns a gorgeous shade of gold. Best served when still warm, it is also perfectly delectable at room temperature\u2014terrific picnic, or lamb roast, fare.<\/p>\n<p>1 \u00bd Tbs extra-virgin olive oil, plus \u00be cup, warm<br \/>1 small yellow onion, peeled and minced<br \/>3 medium tomatoes, cored and chopped<br \/>Leaves of 2 sprigs fresh thyme<br \/>1 bay leaf<br \/>A pinch of sugar<br \/>Freshly ground black pepper<br \/>\u00be lb boneless, skinless dried salt cod, soaked overnight in abundant water, drained, rinsed, and cubed<br \/>4 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped<br \/>1 \u00bd Tbs heavy cream<br \/>Salt<br \/>3 Tbs cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche<br \/>1 large egg<br \/>1 sheet puff pastry, such as Dufour<\/p>\n<p>Heat 1 \u00bd Tbs olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions, and cook until soft. Add half the garlic and the tomatoes, thyme, bay leaf, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer the sauce until it is as thick as a paste, about 40-45 minutes. Discard the bay leaf, and set the sauce aside.<\/p>\n<p>While the tomato sauce cooks, bring a medium pot of water to a boil; remove it from the heat, and add the cod. Cover the pot, and let it rest for 7 minutes. Drain the cod into a colander or sieve; then transfer it to a food processor. Add the remaining garlic, and process to combine. With the motor still running, gradually add \u00be cup warm olive oil through the feed tube in the processor lid; then add the cream. Adjust the seasonings with salt. Transfer the mousse to a bowl, and stir in the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and the egg.

Roll the puff pastry out on a floured surface to a large, 1\/16\u201d-thick round. Fit the pastry into a removable bottom tart pan (the original recipe calls for an 11\u201d pan, but I used a 9\u201d with no problems), and trim the edges. Prick the pastry all over with a fork; cover it with plastic wrap; and chill it for 30 minutes. <\/p>\n<p>Remove the tart shell from the fridge, and spread the tomato sauce in a thin but thorough layer over the bottom (you may have some sauce left over); then cover it with the salt cod mixture. Bake the tart on the pizza stone until golden brown, 20-25 minutes.
