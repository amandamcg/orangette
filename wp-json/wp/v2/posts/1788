This may be <strong>the most luscious piece of steel I\u2019ve ever seen<\/strong>. I held it and stroked its every curve and ridge. I\u2019ll be with this pot for the rest of my life, and that\u2019s a long time. Between me and this pot, it\u2019s till death do us part.<\/p>\n<p>So it was only appropriate that I get it down and dirty that very night and put it, naturally, to the old trial by fire. Indeed, my new stockpot was perfect for whipping up the evening\u2019s first course, a double batch of <strong>apple and butternut squash soup with curry, cardamom, and mace<\/strong>. It\u2019s a recipe my mother has been making for years, and it\u2019s well-traveled, having led off a very raucous, drink- and dancing-filled French-style Thanksgiving dinner in Paris in 1999. Also in its favor is the fact that it\u2019s very, very simple to make, assuming that you\u2019re not averse to a bit of chopping and have some sort of blending apparatus handy. Smooth and warming with an undertone of curry, it\u2019s just the thing for a San Francisco Christmas dinner, or Seattle winter nights with young Mick Jagger.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Apple and Butternut Squash Soup<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If possible, make this soup a day or two ahead; its flavors meld and deepen after a day or so of sitting the fridge.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Butternut%20squash%20soup_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/12\/Butternut-squash-soup_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\u00bc cup olive oil<br \/>1 2-lb butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 2-inch pieces (about 4 cups)<br \/>2 flavorful apples, preferably Gala, peeled, cored, and cut into 2-inch pieces (about 2 cups)<br \/>1 large onion, peeled and coarsely chopped (about 1 cup)<br \/>\u00be tsp curry powder<br \/>\u00be tsp ground mace<br \/>\u00bd tsp ground cardamom<br \/>1 cup good-quality apple cider<br \/>1 quart chicken stock (vegetable works fine as well)<br \/>\u00bd tsp salt<br \/>\u00bc freshly ground pepper, preferably white<\/p>\n<p>Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-low heat.
