This has nothing to do with the vernal equinox or that start-of-spring nonsense everyone is twittering about. No, dear reader, <strong>Seattle is aglow because it&#8217;s Pork Week<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>By most accounts, the first celebration of Pork Week occurred five years ago, when two transplanted Southerners decided to consecrate 1\/52nd of their year to uninterrupted praise of the pig. Inspired by a pig roast held by some friends, Mark and Justin\u2014sharing slightly twangy accents and, at the time, a house\u2014declared the first full week after St. Patrick\u2019s Day to be Pork Week. Forget the leftover corned beef in the fridge: among this small crowd, from the first Sunday after St. Patrick\u2019s Day through the Saturday that follows, <strong>pork must be consumed at least once a day<\/strong>.* Communal dinners are held a couple times over the week\u2014this year, it\u2019s Tuesday and Thursday, with a \u201cgala\u201d finale on Saturday\u2014and other days, the observant fend for themselves.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transcending the bacon and pork chops of their homeland<\/strong>, these Southerners are doing the pig proud with a variety of marinades; hot, smoky peppers; fiery orange sauces; Cuban black beans and rice; and, as rumor has it, mojitos.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a story of growing up,\u201d Mark said, meat thermometer in hand.<br \/><strong>\u201cIt\u2019s a coming-of-age story,\u201d<\/strong> Justin affirmed.<\/p>\n<p>And because Mark is the boyfriend of my dear friend Keaton\u2014<em>and<\/em> because I won his heart by <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/08\/prelude-to-lamb-roast-or-why-it-is.html\">singing \u201cNine to Five\u201d and \u201cThe Gambler\u201d<\/a> over a pool table last summer\u2014I was invited to join in Tuesday night\u2019s festivities. Upon arrival, Keaton and I were enthusiastically greeted by Mark\u2019s two pit bulls, Maynard and Elsa, and the evening began with glasses of Shiraz for the ladies and Rainier (the house beer) for the men. In the kitchen, Mark and Justin were hard at work on a Mexican-inspired spread, with plenty of lemons, limes, cilantro, and jalapenos in attendance. The rest of us set right to work in our own way, clustering around the tortilla chips and <strong>Justin\u2019s improvised tomatillo-avocado salsa and pico de gallo<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/03\/Pork_Week_salsa_and_chips.jpg\" width=\"415\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Mark claims that chemistry\u2014a graduate-school stopover before he landed in his current field, metalwork\u2014taught him how to cook, and how certain flavors and techniques work together. Food scientists are all the rage these days, from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/0684800012\/qid=1111604159\/sr=2-1\/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1\/103-2612240-9302254\">Harold McGee<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/0688102298\/qid=1111604179\/sr=2-1\/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1\/103-2612240-9302254\">Shirley Corriher<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/1584790830\/qid=1111604179\/sr=2-5\/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_5\/103-2612240-9302254\">Alton Brown<\/a>, but frankly, they could take <strong>a few style tips from Mark, what with his canine sidekicks (begging fiercely but respectfully) and his Rainier t-shirt<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/03\/Pork_Week_Rainier.jpg\" width=\"415\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The man knows his way around a piece of meat. While Mark carved, we set the table and laid out the spread: saut\u00e9ed spinach with onions; a mountain of roasted-corn mashed potatoes; warmed corn and flour tortillas; and small bowls of red onion, diced tomato, mashed avocado, lemon and lime wedges, minced jalapenos, chopped cilantro, and sour cream.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/03\/Pork_Week_mashers.jpg\" width=\"416\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And then Mark emerged from the kitchen with the centerpiece and the reason we\u2019d come: two beautiful roasted pork tenderloins, wallowing happily in a sauce of saut\u00e9ed and pureed poblano-ish peppers. The sauce was a deep olive green, thin but complexly flavored with a variety of ingredients Mark would not reveal, though he did concede that my guess of cinnamon was correct. I blushed with pride. We tucked the meat into warm tortillas slathered with salsa and avocado, squeezing lime juice over the top and reaching impatiently for more cilantro and jalapeno. I downed two drippy, overflowing tacos with ease and went back for another slice of pork. And next to me, <strong>Keaton, who only recently had a nightmare involving a pig slaughter and lots of squealing, stifled her tentative plans for a return to vegetarianism<\/strong> with two tacos of her own. You\u2019d better believe Seattle was aglow.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/03\/Pork_Week_plate_sharpened.jpg\" width=\"415\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By that point, dessert was almost an afterthought, but we managed to find room for a modest and messy rhubarb crumble, my nod to spring.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/03\/Pork_Week_rhubarb_crumble.jpg\" width=\"414\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Even Mark\u2014whose sweet tooth is, as Keaton explains it, the size of a pea\u2014cleaned his plate.
