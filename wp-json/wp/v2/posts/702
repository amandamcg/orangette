It often tastes flat and tinny, like canned tomato juice, and on a particularly unfortunate day, it can resemble a regrettable attempt at salsa. Keena\u2019s is neither. It\u2019s smooth and almost creamy, an opaque shade of orange, with a whiff of olive oil and a kick of sherry vinegar. The only sad part of this story is that I was so busy getting destroyed at Bananagrams that I downed it before I thought to take a picture.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530568840658337890\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/8ef96-5102942952_6a5f7ca570_b1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"265\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m on the road this week, and my Internet connection is so slow that getting this thing posted has aged me by about a year, but I wanted to say hi. That, and that you should drop everything and make this gazpacho, before the good tomatoes and peppers are gone. It\u2019s going to be a long, hard winter of tubers and crucifers. This is our last hurrah.<\/p>\n<p>Keena\u2019s gazpacho starts with olive oil, which you put in a blender and whip at high speed. It\u2019s an unusual step, and it\u2019s the key, I think, to this recipe. It gives the soup its light, nearly velvety texture, as though you\u2019d sneaked in a dash of cream. When the olive oil thickens and begins to froth, you add garlic, sweet peppers, cucumber, and a combination of yellow and red tomatoes, and then you let it rip along on high for a while longer, until the mixture is smooth enough to be sipped from a glass, if you\u2019re a gazpacho-sipping kind of person. If not, you can spoon it from a bowl. Either way, you\u2019ll want to splash some sherry vinegar into the blender before you serve it, because that\u2019s the spark that gets it glowing.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Keena\u2019s Gazpacho<\/h2>\n        <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2010-10-26T01:25:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/702?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>My friend Keena learned to make this gazpacho from her sister-in-law Margot. But I still call it Keena\u2019s Gazpacho, because she\u2019s put her own twist on it. Here are some notes to consider before you start:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Keena uses heirloom tomatoes for their flavor and color, and at a minimum, she uses at least one yellow tomato, so that the finished gazpacho has a beautiful orange color. She tells me that when she tried making the recipe with only red tomatoes, it worked fine, but the taste seemed a little flatter and the color was less pretty. Her sister-in-law once made it using all Green Zebra heirloom tomatoes and a yellow pepper instead of a red one, and the resulting gazpacho was a pretty shade of green. Whatever tomatoes she uses, Keena makes this gazpacho in a 7-cup blender, and the size of the blender determines how many tomatoes you can use. She uses as many as will fit in her blender jar.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Keena likes her gazpacho smooth and sippable, but her sister-in-law garnishes it with diced cucumber and bell peppers, so that it\u2019s a little chunky. You can do whatever you want.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 - 5 medium to large tomatoes, ideally yellow and red (see note above)\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 Tbsp. olive oil\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 - 2 garlic cloves\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd of a green bell pepper, seeded and chopped\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd of a medium to large cucumber, peeled, seeded, and chopped\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd to \u00be of a red bell pepper, seeded and chopped\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 - 3 Tbsp. sherry vinegar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Salt to taste          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Bring a saucepan of water to a boil.

Add the garlic, and process briefly. Add the bell peppers, cucumber, a couple pinches of salt, and as many tomatoes as will fit comfortably into your blender. Process on high speed for a while, stopping the blender from time to time to scrape down the sides of the jar and mush around the ingredients as needed to allow the blender to run smoothly. (The mixture will be fairly thick until the tomatoes are pureed.) Let the blender go as long as you can stand the noise; the longer it goes, the better it will taste and the creamier it will be. Add 2 tablespoons of the sherry vinegar, and process to incorporate.
