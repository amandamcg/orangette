Good<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">night<\/span>.  How on earth did that happen?  I didn\u2019t know I had it in me, really, until it was done.  Life o\u2019 mine, you are full of surprises &#8211; and also dirty dishes, and dirty laundry, and dust bunnies.  I spent Thursday afternoon scrubbing the kitchen sink, sweeping the bathroom floor, and going through mail that had been sitting next to my desk since October.  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">October<\/span>, people.  Then I watched four episodes of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbc.com\/Law_&amp;_Order:_Criminal_Intent\/index.shtml\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent<\/span><\/a> (I have an itty bitty crush on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbc.com\/Law_&amp;_Order:_Criminal_Intent\/bios\/donofrio.shtml\">Vincent D\u2019Onofrio<\/a>; don\u2019t tell); ate two pains au chocolat; danced around to the Pixies\u2019 <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Surfer_Rosa\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Surfer Rosa<\/span><\/a> for a couple of hours; and finally, yesterday, fell asleep curled around a pile of warm laundry and missed most of the afternoon, including a holiday party at the home of friends.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/dc63a-spooncookies041-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/dc63a-spooncookies041-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5144806775852301426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Oh yeah.

Butter.  Cookies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I feel so much better.  About everything.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ab5ad-spooncookies026-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ab5ad-spooncookies026-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5144807896838765714\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>I clipped the recipe for these little beauties two years ago, but it took me until now &#8211; my priorities have been <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">totally<\/span> out of line &#8211; to try them.  But better late than never, I say, because they\u2019re <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">lovely<\/span>.  For one thing, they\u2019re some of the prettiest cookies I\u2019ve ever seen.  Shaped in the well of a teaspoon &#8211; a tad tedious, yes, but therapeutic in a way, and totally worth it &#8211; they turn out smooth and curvy, the approximate size and shape of a flattened egg.  They\u2019re pale gold and flecked with toasted bits of butter, and you sandwich them with a festive sash of jam across the waistline.  They\u2019re sophisticated but still approachable, eminently edible.  If they were human, you\u2019d want to pinch their cheeks <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">and<\/span> buy them a drink.<\/p>\n<p>Then, of course, there\u2019s the flavor: intensely buttery, warm and rich, and ever-so-slightly nutty, with a sandy crumb that melts instantly on the tongue.  They remind me a bit of Pecan Sandies\u00ae &#8211; only minus the pecans and plus jam.  (If you grew up, as I did, with Pecan Sandies\u00ae, you\u2019ll know that\u2019s high praise.)  Their creator, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/233297\">Celia Barbour<\/a>, calls them \u201cthe best cookies in the world,\u201d and while I\u2019m not <i>quite<\/i> ready to go that far &#8211; they don\u2019t, after all, contain chocolate &#8211; I think she\u2019s onto something.  I can\u2019t imagine a better cookie for dunking in a mug of coffee on Christmas Day.  They\u2019re coming along in my carry-on tomorrow morning, when we fly to the East Coast for the holidays.  I\u2019ll be back in a couple of weeks, with an empty cookie tin in tow.<\/p>\n<p>Friends, I wish you the very happiest of holidays.  It\u2019s been quite a year, and I\u2019ve loved spending it with you.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Brown Butter Spoon Cookies with Jam<\/span><br \/>Adapted from <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Gourmet<\/span>, December 2005<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to tell you that these are the world\u2019s easiest cookies, because they do take a bit of time and technique.  But I <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">will<\/span> tell you that they\u2019re outlandishly delicious, and that there\u2019s something terrifically calming about shaping and assembling them, even if it does take a while.  Plus, the dough is wonderfully simple &#8211; maybe the simplest I\u2019ve ever made.  You make it right in the saucepan!  Neat-o.<\/p>\n<p>As for shaping the dough, well, it\u2019s a little tricky at first, but after the first 10 or 12, you\u2019ll find yourself settling into it: instinctively knowing how much dough to use for each cookie, how to press it just so into the bowl of a teaspoon, how to slide it out.  By the second pan, it was actually going pretty quickly. Oh, and don\u2019t worry about little imperfections: the heat of the oven will soften and smooth them.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, about the preserves: Celia Barbour recommends using a mixture of half cherry and half strawberry, but I used only strawberry.  Whatever you choose, make sure it\u2019s a jam you love.  My strawberry jam was homemade, left over from a recipe project this fall, and its flavor was terrific with the brown butter cookie.<\/p>\n<p>2 sticks (1 cup) cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes<br \/>\u00be cup granulated sugar<br \/>2 tsp. vanilla extract<br \/>2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>1 tsp. baking soda<br \/>1\/8 tsp. salt, slightly rounded<br \/>Heaping 1\/3 cup fruit preserves<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">To make the dough<\/span>:<br \/>Fill the kitchen sink with about 2 inches of very cold water.<\/p>\n<p>In a medium heavy saucepan, melt the butter over moderate heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter turns golden and smells nutty and flecks on the bottom of the pan turn a rich caramelly brown, about 10 to 12 minutes.  (Butter will initially foam a bit, then dissipate.  A thicker foam will appear and cover the surface just before the butter begins to brown; stir more frequently once this occurs.)  Remove the pan from the heat and place it in the sink to stop the butter from cooking further.  Cool, stirring occasionally, about 4 minutes.  Remove the pan from the sink, and stir in the sugar and vanilla.<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.  Add to the butter mixture and stir until a dough forms.  Shape the dough into two balls \u2013 or one, but it\u2019s a little unwieldy \u2013 and wrap in plastic wrap.  Set aside at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours to allow the flavors to develop.  (Alternatively, chill dough balls until you\u2019re ready to use them.  Allow the chilled dough to soften at room temperature for at least one hour before shaping into cookies and baking.)<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">To shape and bake the cookies<\/span>:<br \/>Set an oven rack in the middle position, and preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F.<\/p>\n<p>Choose a teaspoon with a deep bowl.  (I used an antique silver teaspoon; older spoons in general, I find, have nice deep bowls.   Do not use a measuring spoon.)  Pinch off a small bit of dough from one of the balls and press it into the bowl of the spoon, flattening the top.  The dough will feel crumbly, but as you press and mold it, it will become cohesive.  Pressing gently, slide the shaped dough out of the spoon and place it, flat side down, on an ungreased baking sheet.  (I lined mine with a silicon liner for easy clean-up.)  Continue forming cookies and arranging them on the sheet pan; you should be able to fit about 18 cookies.  Bake the cookies until just pale golden, about 8 to 15 minutes.  Cool them on the sheet pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes; then transfer them to the rack and cool completely.  Meanwhile, continue shaping and baking more cookies until all the dough is gone.  You should be able to make about 60 to 70 cookies in all.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">To assemble the cookies<\/span>:<br \/>While the cookies cool, heat the preserves in a small saucepan over low heat until just runny.  Pour and scrape through a sieve into a small bowl to remove seeds and solids.  Cool completely.  (I stuck mine in the fridge for a few minutes.)<\/p>\n<p>Working with one cookie at a time, spread the flat side with a thin layer of preserves.  Sandwich with the flat side of a second cookie.  Continue with the remaining cookies and preserves.  Let the finished cookies stand until the jam is set, about 45 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Transfer cookies to an airtight container and wait 2 days &#8211; really! &#8211; before eating to allow the flavor to develop.  (Or, if making them well in advance, freeze them.)<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 30-35 sandwich cookies<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You guys really are terrific.
