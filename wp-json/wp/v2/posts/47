Right! A couple of weeks ago, during a reprieve between viruses, my mother, June, and I managed to bake a double batch of Russian Tea Cakes, a cookie that my mother used to make every year when I was a kid, back when she and our family friend Barbara Fretwell would hole up together in the weeks before Christmas and churn out eight or ten kinds of cookies and candies to pack in decorative tins and distribute to lucky friends around town.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/82018-_f7a46291.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/82018-_f7a46291.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I\u2019ve written before about some of the recipes that my mother and Barbara used, like <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/11\/to-my-hearts-content.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chocolate Rads<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/with-my-own-two-hands.html\" target=\"_blank\">Espresso-Walnut Toffee<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/12\/coming-of-age-in-cookies.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fruit-Nut Balls<\/a>. There were also cranberry-pistachio biscotti, and chocolate-dipped pecan bars with shortbread crust, and a cookie called an Apricot Crescent, with cream cheese-enriched dough and apricot jam inside. They even made <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mendiant\" target=\"_blank\"><i>mendiants<\/i><\/a>. Opening one of their tins was like looking inside my mother\u2019s jewelry box, rows and piles of color and shine. Maybe next year, I\u2019ll tell you about their Linzer Cookies, the best Linzer specimen I\u2019ve had. But they\u2019re fiddly, and though Mom and I did manage to make some last week, I didn\u2019t take pictures and instead wound up taking a nap. Russian Tea Cakes are easier, even if you\u2019re short on time, energy, and\/or holiday spirit, and they\u2019re something that even a two-year-old could help with, sort of, if she doesn\u2019t eat all the dough first.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/25485-_f7a46401.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/25485-_f7a46401.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I imagine you\u2019ve heard of Russian Tea Cakes. They also go by the name Mexican Wedding Cookies, and probably some other names, too. Sometimes, to be frank, when I run across them out in the world, I don\u2019t think Russian Tea Cakes are all that great. Some taste mostly of sugar, or worse, of flour. This makes me cranky. A Russian Tea Cake should be rich, tender, melting almost instantly when you bite into it. As holiday cookie recipes go, this one is plain, bare-bones: just six ingredients, a mixer, maybe 15 minutes to mix up the dough, maybe 15 minutes to roll the cookies, maybe 10 minutes to roll them in powdered sugar. But the return on investment is impressive: these things are so delicate, so buttery, so nutty, that people get grabby in their presence. They\u2019re nothing new, no, but there\u2019s a good reason why we still make them.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/6fbeb-_f7a46631.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/6fbeb-_f7a46631.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>The recipe my mother uses was given to her by someone named Nettie Maxwell, the wife of a physician who was once in practice with my dad, and I have a xerox of it, written in Nettie\u2019s looping old-lady script. While I would like to think that Nettie\u2019s version is unique, there are tons of recipes out there for Russian Tea Cakes, and most are very similar to hers. I don\u2019t think any of us can take credit. Nettie used pecans, so Mom and I do, too; it feels like the Oklahoma thing to do. But you could try any other nut: hazelnuts, walnuts, even macadamias.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c6d4b-_f7a46511.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c6d4b-_f7a46511.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<p>Happy holidays to you and yours! 2014 marked the tenth year of this site, and I\u2019ve had more fun here, and felt more fired up, than I had in a long time.

I\u2019m hoping to do some writing and brainstorming, though I may just, I don\u2019t know, take a vacation. Maybe. In any case, thank you for another year!

In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, beating just to blend. Add the pecans, and mix just a little more, until the nuts are incorporated. Use your hands to gather the dough into a ball, pressing in any runaway nuts. Wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.<\/p>\n<p>The next day, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F, and line two baking sheets with parchment. Remove the chilled dough from the fridge, and allow it to soften for about 10 minutes before handling it. Pinch off small lumps of dough, roll them into 1-inch balls, and space them evenly on the prepared baking sheets. Bake for about 10 minutes, or until they are set but not browning \u2013 though, yes, the undersides will brown slightly. Allow to cool for a few minutes. Put some powdered sugar in a pie plate or shallow bowl. While the cookies are still warm, roll them in the sugar, and then set them on a cooling rack. The sugar will only coat them lightly, and they may feel a little sticky. Cool them completely, and then roll them a second time.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: about 40 cookies<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>WE ARE WELL!
