I went to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.westminsterschool.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">a Montessori-influenced school<\/a>, myself, from preschool through middle school, and Brandon once spent a year teaching music in a Montessori school, and without going into a whole bunch of educational philosophy that I only vaguely\u00a0follow\u00a0and that, as a result, makes me really sleepy, I will just say that I loved the Montessori method as a student, and that it makes a lot of sense to us as parents. (Let&#8217;s ignore, for now, the fact that I will possibly never be accustomed to thinking of myself as a Parent.) Despite my lifelong tendency to overthink everything, I have always had a weird, vaguely\u00a0witchy, but very welcome sense that June <em>will be okay in life<\/em>, whatever we do. And\u00a0so, when a number of friends and acquaintances recommended\u00a0this particular school, Brandon and I crossed our fingers\u00a0and, without much more than that, decided to go for it.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, parents are required to spend a handful of hours volunteering at this\u00a0school. And recently, as I spent an hour helping a gaggle of\u00a0preschoolers prepare berry shortcake for a tea party, I was struck by how\u00a0<em>capable<\/em> these small humans\u00a0are, able to slice the stems from strawberries and wash slippery dishware\u00a0with great care, even as they also wipe their noses\u00a0on their sleeves and sneak\u00a0berries from the bowl because it&#8217;s reeeeeeeeally hard to wait. June is essentially growing up in a restaurant, and cooking at home is a daily thing,\u00a0but we are regular mortal parents, not Superparents: we\u00a0don&#8217;t often involve\u00a0her in the actual preparation of meals, because cooking with a three-year-old is not Supereasy, and because of the nose on the sleeve, the whole hard-to-wait thing, the FEMA-level cleanup effort. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/5TCgsEOD9p\/?taken-by=mollyorangette\" target=\"_blank\">Last summer<\/a>, she and I made <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2010\/08\/but-then\/\" target=\"_blank\">cobbler<\/a> together, and she&#8217;s good at cracking eggs, and she and Brandon have even made pizza together. But given how often we prepare food at home, how <em>normal<\/em> it is in our household, well,\u00a0in the grand scheme of things, we do not often cook with our kid. And I came home from my volunteer shift\u00a0feeling itchy to change that.\u00a0I came home with a different sense of possibility, a renewed\u00a0appreciation for\u00a0the practical education of everyday life, and a gut feeling\u00a0that June can do more than we have been asking of her &#8211; and that she wants to.<\/p>\n<p>This past Wednesday morning, we had another little girl and her mom over, and the four of us made cookies. This is not something I usually do in the middle of the week, I should clarify, but since it&#8217;s\u00a0June&#8217;s mid-winter break, and since Brandon is working long hours on <a href=\"http:\/\/dinostomatopie.com\" target=\"_blank\">Dino&#8217;s<\/a>\u00a0(opening within the month!)\u00a0and we are short on childcare and I am trying to keep June and myself productively occupied so one or both of us doesn&#8217;t start yelling and\/or crying, making cookies with friends seemed like a good way to pass a morning. And it was. As I was cleaning up afterward and reveling in the holy quiet\u00a0that is nap time, I realized that the morning had gone well, in part, because June and I went into it with a certain amount of trust, structure, and preparation. And I decided to sit down and write a small\u00a0list of the things I know about\u00a0cooking with a young child, before I forget them all.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9461 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/F7A6447-2-1324x883.jpg\" alt=\"_F7A6447-2\" width=\"1324\" height=\"883\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/F7A6447-2-1324x883.jpg 1324w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/F7A6447-2-662x441.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/F7A6447-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/F7A6447-2-870x580.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1324px) 100vw, 1324px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Number 1! I try, I really try, not to\u00a0fetishize food or cooking. Food is an extremely pleasurable, nourishing part of life, and we get to share it with people: that&#8217;s <em>amazing<\/em>.\u00a0But food is also a very normal, everyday thing, like sleeping, reading, and taking a walk.\u00a0I don&#8217;t want her to think that food is something to be worshipped &#8211; or, conversely, loathed. And I know that the more excited I seem about something, and the more I am totally drooling all over myself to get her excited about it too, the less excited she will be. I try to play it cool.<\/p>\n<p>2. A small, easy-to-move stool is essential. Or, if not a stool, a small, sturdy, kid-size chair that you don&#8217;t mind someone standing on. June pulls a small chair up to the counter to work beside me, to wash her hands at the sink, to do everything.<\/p>\n<p>3. Lots of dish towels! \u00a0I don&#8217;t care about spills, and I don&#8217;t care if my dish towels get stained or burned or torn, because I have lots and lots\u00a0of them. (And as they get dirty, June gets to chuck them down &#8220;the laundry chute,&#8221; aka the stairs to our dungeon\/first-floor-that-feels-like-a-basement.)<\/p>\n<p>4. A couple of months ago, June came home from a visit to my mom&#8217;s house and suddenly, magically, knew how to crack an egg. THANK YOU, MOM! I would have never thought to teach her that. Turns out, three-year-olds are not only capable of cracking an egg, but they are INTO it, too. And if and when she gets a splinter of\u00a0eggshell in the bowl, I just use part of the shell to scoop it out. (Or, if it&#8217;s too late to fish it out and the egg is already in the frying pan, Brandon and I have learned to, um, just take a big bite of egg, don&#8217;t chew too much, and swallow quickly.)<\/p>\n<p>5. Do not cook or bake with a child when you are feeling cranky or in a hurry or are not willing to be pummeled with questions about everything. Actually maybe do not have a child if you are feeling cranky or in a hurry or are not willing to be pummeled with questions about everything.<\/p>\n<p>6. Do not cook or bake with a child if you don&#8217;t want the kitchen to get dirty. Ha ha haaaaaaaaaa, oh man.<\/p>\n<p>7. Measure and prep ingredients ahead of time, if at all possible, so that the child&#8217;s tasks are\u00a0limited to stirring \/ dumping things from bowl to bowl \/ washing \/ things you want them to do \/ things they can do\u00a0successfully.<\/p>\n<p>8. Kids can cut up soft fruits and vegetables! Montessori <a href=\"http:\/\/www.montessoriservices.com\/vegetable-chopper-with-wooden-handle\" target=\"_blank\">knives<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.montessoriservices.com\/practical-life\/food-preparation\/cutting-slicing\/wavy-chopper\" target=\"_blank\">choppers<\/a> are great, though I haven&#8217;t yet bought any for home. We mostly use a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000FUO3QM\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000FUO3QM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=YT3EESGEHZFCS4MW\" target=\"_blank\">partially serrated butter knife<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>9. Kids can wash dishes, if you show them how. And while June is not quite yet able to wash dishes <em>well<\/em>, she will be within the next six months to a year. (She&#8217;s 3\u00bd.)<\/p>\n<p>10. Kids can set the table. June sets ours every night, taking the correct number of forks from the drawer and the correct number of napkins from the bowl and putting them (approximately) at our usual seats at the table. (Though she does like to &#8220;hide&#8221; the utensils inside the folded-up napkin because it&#8217;s so, so, sooooo funny.)<\/p>\n<p>11. Kids can peel hard-boiled eggs, bananas, and clementines and mandarins, if you show them how. And they can serve others, counting out individual pieces of fruit or vegetables and making sure everyone gets the right amount.<\/p>\n<p>12. When June was just old enough to stand on a chair without my worrying about her falling, I used to stand her next to me at the counter while I chopped vegetables for soup. And as I chopped them, I would slide them in front of her, and her job was then to put them into a bowl. That was fun for a long time, by which I mean five minutes. Still. These days, she can take it a step further, stirring\u00a0olive oil into a bowl of vegetables for roasting and helping to distribute them on the pan.<\/p>\n<p>13. Kids can spread butter or jam on toast. They can put frosting on cookies and cakes. June can make her own peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich. This all takes an investment of time up front &#8211; the first couple of times, June wanted to put the entire jar of jam on her sandwich &#8211; but\u00a0now she&#8217;s made her own sandwich\u00a0a half-dozen times, with only a minimum of (covert, across-the-room) attention\u00a0on my part. And she&#8217;s so proud.<\/p>\n<p>And, finally, 14. I ask myself this all the time, in every aspect of life:\u00a0<em>what is the worst that could happen<\/em>? What is the worst thing that could happen if I let June make her own peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich? \u00a0She could, in fact, put the entire jar of jam on the sandwich. But really, so what? I actually don&#8217;t care very much. We will both (probably) survive it. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EcU0qbV70rU\" target=\"_blank\">My heart will go on<\/a>. She&#8217;ll eat less jam tomorrow. Really, what is the worst that could happen? She makes a mess, for sure. That&#8217;s usually all. And unless the food I&#8217;m\u00a0making with her\u00a0is ready-to-eat &#8211; like a salad, or a sandwich &#8211; any germs will be cooked\u00a0to death. The stakes are, in most things, much lower than we think.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got. That, and the recipe for Jimmy&#8217;s Pink Cookies from <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1416551069\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1416551069&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=4JKIGSQKC3WQGNF7\" target=\"_blank\">A Homemade Life<\/a><\/em>, the recipe we made on Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for sticking around. x<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Jimmy's Pink Cookies<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">from <i>A Homemade Life<\/i><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2016-02-19T18:40:13-05:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/9390?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>I made the dough first thing on Wednesday morning, while June was watching <em>Daniel Tiger<\/em> &#8211; real talk &#8211; and it was ready to roll out an hour later, when our friends arrived. I\u00a0<em>highly<\/em> recommend making the dough ahead, since waiting for dough to chill is not easy for kids. And if you can, go ahead and measure out the frosting ingredients while you&#8217;re doing the dough.<\/p>\n<p>Once we were ready to get started, I took charge of rolling out the dough, and then the girls went to work with their chosen cookie cutters. (The original recipe below calls for using round cookie cutters, but we used alphabet shapes.) I helped ease the dough shapes from the cutters onto the baking sheet, and I rerolled the dough scraps as needed. But mostly, I let them do their thing. While the cookies baked and cooled, June helped me beat up the frosting, and then each kid got a small knife and their own bowl of frosting for spreading on the finished cookies.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n              <h3>For the cookies:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd sticks (170 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd cup powdered sugar, sifted\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd cups (210 grams) all-purpose flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bc teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd teaspoon vanilla extract\r          <\/div>\n                      <h3>For the frosting:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            4 ounces (112 grams) cream cheese, at room temperature\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 tablespoons (42 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd cups powdered sugar, sifted\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00be teaspoon kirsch, or more to taste, or a half-capful of cherry extract\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Red food coloring (optional, but the frosting won't be pink without it)          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>To make the cookies, combine the butter and powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat, first on low speed and then slowly increasing to medium, until light and fluffy. Scrape down the side of the bowl as needed.<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk the flour and salt. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, beating until the flour is just absorbed. Add the vanilla, and beat well to incorporate. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap on the countertop, and turn the dough out onto it. Gather the dough into a ball, and press it into a thin, smooth disk. Wrap well, and refrigerate for one hour.<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment.<\/p>\n<p>On a clean, lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of about 3\/8 inch. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into any shape you like. (My friend Jimmy uses a heart-shaped cutter when he makes these cookies; I usually use a 2\u00a0\u00bd-inch circle.)<\/p>\n<p>Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 1\u00a0\u00bd inches apart. Bake them one sheet at a time, keeping the second sheet in the fridge until the first is done, for about 16 minutes, or until the cookies look set and are just pale golden at the edge. Do not allow them to brown. Transfer the pan to a wire rack, and allow the cookies to cool completely on the pan. Repeat.<\/p>\n<p>To make the frosting, put the cream cheese and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, and beat on medium speed until smooth. Add the powdered sugar, and beat on low speed to incorporate. Then raise the speed to medium, and beat until there are no lumps, scraping down the side of the bowl as needed. Add the kirsch and a couple of drops of food coloring, and beat well. \u00a0The frosting should be pale pink, ideally, though June wanted it darker than that, so we added some more coloring. Spread the frosting generously &#8211; this is key! lots of frosting! &#8211; onto the fully cooled cookies.<\/p>\n<p>Stored in an airtight container, the frosted cookies will keep in the fridge for a few days, and they&#8217;re delicious cold. You can also freeze them.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 10 to 12 (3-inch) cookies, or more smaller cookies<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, on the ole blog: some thoughts about cooking with a kid!
