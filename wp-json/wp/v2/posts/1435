Which, quite honestly, is no easy feat.<\/p>\n<p>In most circles, the word \u201cwedding\u201d isn\u2019t exactly synonymous with \u201cdelicious.\u201d Usually, it\u2019s just the opposite.  Many venues equipped to host weddings \u2013 hotels, gardens, museums, and so on \u2013 require that you use their (often iffy) in-house caterer, or at least limit your choice to a few companies.  That\u2019s part of the reason why Brandon and I felt so picky about <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/08\/dramatic-and-wonderful.html\">our wedding site<\/a>.  We didn\u2019t want to choose a caterer \u2013 and, by extension, the food we would eat on our wedding day \u2013 just because some stodgy administrator told us to. In fact, the more we looked around, the more we more we found ourselves thinking about the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">caterer<\/span>, not just the site where we\u2019d be eating said caterer\u2019s food. In the end, when we chose Bellingham, we chose it not only because it was pretty and on the water and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">blah blah blah<\/span>, but also because of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ciaothyme.com\/\">Cia\u00f2 Thyme<\/a>.  We even changed our wedding date \u2013 from July 28 to July 29 \u2013 to match their availability.   We meant business.  We just knew they were right.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4a5a7-croquembouche1.gif\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4a5a7-croquembouche1.gif?w=229\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5100579681331264802\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>I mean, I don\u2019t know about you, but <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">my<\/span> kind of caterer is the type that claps his hands and gets giddy when you ask him to make fingerling potato chips.  I like the kind who, when you tell him \u2013 somewhat sheepishly, almost apologizing \u2013 that you want deviled eggs during the cocktail hour, grins, rubs his hands together, and starts gushing excitedly about cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and herbed aioli and capers and caviar and the little, tiny chicken eggs he can get from a farmer nearby.  I also like the kind of caterer who calls to ask whether you\u2019d like the mirepoix for your farro salad kept crunchy, or more caramelized.  It\u2019s also quite terrific when he calls to tell you, giddily, that he\u2019s been out meeting with his usual farmers, and that your beets have just been picked, and that your potatoes are being harvested on <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=Lummi+Island,+WA,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title\">Lummi Island<\/a> right this minute, and that, you know, he\u2019s been thinking about the blue cheese for the beets, and if it\u2019s alright, he\u2019s feeling kind of excited about a particular Spanish type, rather than one from Oregon.  I also like the kind of caterer who dances with you at your wedding, and who hugs you and kisses you <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">and<\/span> your new husband on the cheeks.  I really like that kind.  Which, luckily, is just what we got.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c8b36-mollybrandon6271.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c8b36-mollybrandon6271.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5100899334272269650\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>                                                              <span style=\"font-size:78%;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>I can\u2019t say enough about Cia\u00f2 Thyme.  It\u2019s owned and run by Jessica and Mataio Gillis, she being the coordinator and keeper of all details, he being the chef and chief forager.  They call their operation a \u201crestaurant without walls,\u201d featuring local produce and doing all cooking on-site.  Because they deal only in seasonal foods and every menu they make is different, they don\u2019t do tastings, so until our rehearsal dinner \u2013 which they prepared, along with the wedding \u2013 we hadn\u2019t tasted a crumb of their food.    But given what we\u2019d heard from our friend <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/08\/dramatic-and-wonderful.html\">Ashley<\/a>, who tipped us off to them in the first place, not to mention all the promising meetings and phone calls, I have to say, we weren\u2019t worried in the least.  In fact, it kind of made it more fun.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ac1f3-mollybrandon6621.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ac1f3-mollybrandon6621.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5100899570495470946\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Our rehearsal dinner was held at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.co.whatcom.wa.us\/parks\/hovander\/hovander.jsp\">Hovander Homestead Park<\/a> in Ferndale, about 15 minutes north of Bellingham.  We reserved a clearing between a big, red barn and the Nooksack River, with a dozen picnic tables.  Brandon\u2019s dad strung tiny <a href=\"http:\/\/www.potterybarn.com\/products--p8635--index.shtml\">globe lights<\/a> around the two white tents we rented, and Jessica and Mataio covered the tables with ivory cloths and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kraft_paper\">kraft paper<\/a> runners, kraft-colored napkins and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bambuhome.com\/html\/prod_veneerware_01.html\">Bambu veneerware<\/a>.   Each table was topped with a bundle of flowers in a Mason jar &#8211; blue cornflowers, nigella, lavender, and thistle &#8211; and a carafe of fresh raspberry lemonade, and three jars of our <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/07\/all-so-pretty.html\">pickles<\/a>: finger-size carrots with garlic and thyme, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=12111218\">grapes with cinnamon and mustard seed<\/a>, and cornichons with pearl onions.  (Okay, yeah, we didn\u2019t <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">make<\/span> the cornichons, but we did hunt down our favorite brand, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rolandfood.com\/about.cfm\">Roland<\/a>, and repackage them into half-pint jars.  That\u2019s got to count for something.)<\/p>\n<p>We were aiming for an upscale picnic of sorts, the kind of thing where the bride can wear jeans and a messy ponytail and her favorite yellow flats, and where the buffet is spread with all sorts of summery things in their finest incarnation.  The kind of thing that goes nicely with a bottle of hefeweizen and a game of Frisbee.  The kind of thing, let\u2019s say, where my uncle Arnold can sport a ponytail and my niece Mia can sleep in her stroller, parked under a tree.<\/p>\n<p>So this is what we ate:<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Pulled chicken served with salted rosemary buns from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.breadfarm.com\/index.html\">Breadfarm<\/a>, red leaf lettuce, Dijon mustard, basil pesto, tapenade, and sun-dried tomato pesto (and Brandon\u2019s red onion pickles, a big jar full)<\/p>\n<p>A platter of roasted vegetables, including Roma tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, peppers, shallots, shiitake mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes still on the vine<\/p>\n<p>Sliced tomatoes, basil, and fresh buffalo-milk mozzarella<\/p>\n<p>Fingerling potato salad with sweet marinated onions, haricots verts, and whole grain mustard vinaigrette<\/p>\n<p>Fresh berry tartlets with honey mascarpone<\/p>\n<p>and oatmeal-chocolate chip cookies with coconut<\/div>\n<p>Now, you know I\u2019m not much of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/09\/di-fara-pizza-and-exaggeration-that.html\">an exaggerator<\/a> &#8211; not compared to my new husband, anyway &#8211; but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever eaten a sweeter, juicier piece of chicken.  My aunt Tina, too, swooned into her roasted Roma tomato. And my brother David told me later that he nearly ate two sandwiches, just so he could have another roll.  They were tender, like brioche, with shiny brown tops and flecks of fresh rosemary.  Mataio told me that night, as he nestled a gooseberry into the top of a tartlet, that he worked closely with Breadfarm to get the buns just right, size and texture and taste.  (You know you\u2019re working with the right people when you want to plunk down by their set-up table and hang out all night, rather than mingle with your guests. Nothing against our guests, of course, but you know.)<\/p>\n<p>And though this is getting a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">little<\/span> bit long here &#8211;<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> <\/span>pause if you need to, of course, and grab a sandwich or something &#8211; I want to tell you about about our wedding menu too.
