Our address is 1415 NW 70th Street. (It might be helpful, too, to know that we\u2019re one block north of Ballard High School, directly across the street from a bar called Tarasco, and right next to Honore Bakery.) Like our signage, our web site is also still a work in progress, but our phone is up and running, and I consider that a small victory. The number is 206.838.1960. If you would like to reserve a table, please note that we take reservations for parties of six or more only. We\u2019re open from Wednesday to Sunday, dinner only, from five to ten-ish.<\/p>\n<p>A number of you have asked about our menu, so I should probably tell you about that, too. It will change often, depending on the season and what we can buy from local farmers, but this is the one we\u2019re opening with. The scan is wonky, I know, but bear with me. If you click on it, it will enlarge to a much more readable size.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/27190-delanceymenuscan1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5368965158837146418\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/27190-delanceymenuscan1.jpg?w=192\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Eventually, we\u2019ll get a stamp with our logo and bang it down at the top of each menu with some nice, orange-red ink, but until then, I\u2019m writing the restaurant name by hand. It\u2019s kind of a pain, and sometimes my mind wanders midway through the stack and I lose my ability to spell, but it makes me happy. So, I should mention, do chilled peaches in white wine.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e780e-polapeachesinglass1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5368584368889536018\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e780e-polapeachesinglass1.jpg?w=248\" alt=\"\" width=\"1045\" height=\"1262\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nI made these on a whim last week, tossed them up onto the menu, and they might now be my favorite dessert. (For this week, at least.) You just take some peaches, slice them, toss them with sugar, and then dump a bottle of dry white wine on top. Then you put them in the fridge for a while. You can serve them after only a half-day or so, and they\u2019ll taste fantastic, like a very classy, grown-up version of peaches in light syrup. But after a whole day or two, they start to go translucent, and then they\u2019re even better: thoroughly soused, barely sweet, cool and refreshing, almost dangerously easy to eat. (I did not mean to make that rhyme. Or half-rhyme. Whatever. Swear.) Before summer ends, you really should make some. I insist. Especially if you live too far away to come to Delancey and let me make them <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">for<\/span> you.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/3a543-polapeachesinwine1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5368584365339412754\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/3a543-polapeachesinwine1.jpg?w=246\" alt=\"\" width=\"1028\" height=\"1252\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Chilled Peaches in White Wine<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPlatter-Figs-Other-Recipes%2Fdp%2F1579653464&tag=orangette-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A Platter of Figs and Other Recipes<\/span><\/a>, by David Tanis<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2009-08-12T16:21:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>I\u2019ve tried this method with a couple of different wines, but my favorite is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.charlesnealselections.com\/wine\/southwest\/pellehaut-cotes-gascogne\/\">Domaine de Pellehaut \u201cHarmonie de Gascogne.\u201d<\/a> It\u2019s on our wine list, and it\u2019s hard not to love: crisp and light, a little grapefruity, not too expensive &#8211; and perfect, perfect for peaches.
