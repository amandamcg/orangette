It&#8217;s a member of the same family as apples and pears, and it looks a lot like\u00a0both, though its flesh is more dense and harder by far. It&#8217;s knobby, green when it&#8217;s not quite ripe and golden when it is, often covered in grayish-white fuzz, like a peach. It&#8217;s too hard and sour to eat raw, like raw rhubarb but\u00a0worse, and it needs a long, slow cook before it will\u00a0submit to being eaten. I would not write about quince if it weren&#8217;t worth the hassle. It is.<\/p>\n<p>Though I will admit that I have occasionally been guilty of buying one not to eat it, but just to keep it next to the sink\u00a0and sniff it.\u00a0<em>Perfume<\/em> is the best word for what a ripe quince smells like, a little like cooked apples, a little like wine, a little like lemon peel, a lot like flowers. It can fill a room. It&#8217;s so potent, it&#8217;s its own caricature, a\u00a0quince-scented Yankee Candle as engineered by Nature herself. As a kid, I loved the smell of gasoline and was always rolling down the window and taking deep breaths while my parents filled the tank &#8211; this no doubt\u00a0explains a lot &#8211; but as a mature, responsible adult, I&#8217;ve traded the old gasoline habit for a quince on the counter, when seasonally feasible.<\/p>\n<p>That said, if you <em>can<\/em> find a quince, when you&#8217;ve had enough of huffing it, I might recommend that you\u00a0poach it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9148 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/F7A6351-2-2-662x441.jpg\" alt=\"_F7A6351-2-2\" width=\"662\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/F7A6351-2-2-662x441.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/F7A6351-2-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/F7A6351-2-2-1324x883.jpg 1324w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/F7A6351-2-2-870x580.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are lots of ways to eat quince: roasted, cooked down into jam or jelly or the sweet-savory paste called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplyrecipes.com\/recipes\/membrillo_quince_paste\/\" target=\"_blank\">membrillo<\/a>, grated into an apple pie, baked into a <a href=\"http:\/\/food52.com\/recipes\/24694-quince-tarte-tatin\" target=\"_blank\">tarte Tatin<\/a>, and whatnot. I keep meaning to try that tarte Tatin. But mostly, when I come across quince, I poach it. I cook it slowly on the stovetop until it softens into a pool of its own syrup and then eat it the next morning for breakfast, with whole-milk plain yogurt. And then again as a snack around eleven. And then I eat it again later in the day, for\u00a0dessert, on top of\u00a0ice cream or a slice of pound cake. Poached quince lasts for a good week in the refrigerator, and the longer it marinates in its poaching syrup, the prettier it gets. If you&#8217;ve\u00a0cooked it in\u00a0a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidlebovitz.com\/2008\/11\/rosy-poached-quince\/\" target=\"_blank\">poaching liquid sweetened with sugar<\/a>, it will get\u00a0redder as it sits. If your poaching liquid is sweetened with maple syrup, it&#8217;ll go a handsome\u00a0ruddy brown, the color of a caramelized apple.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9163 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/F7A6384-2-662x441.jpg\" alt=\"_F7A6384-2\" width=\"662\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/F7A6384-2-662x441.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/F7A6384-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/F7A6384-2-1324x883.jpg 1324w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/F7A6384-2-870x580.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Poaching quince doesn&#8217;t really require a recipe, but my favorite version comes from a new-ish book called <em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1607747464\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1607747464&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=ZONDFHQRE4B57UWZ\" target=\"_blank\">The New Sugar and Spice<\/a><\/em>, by <a href=\"http:\/\/lovecommacake.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Samantha Seneviratne<\/a>, who, incidentally, I met once in the summer of 2005 in our mutual friend Amy Leo&#8217;s backyard in New Jersey, though I haven&#8217;t seen her since.

Whisk to combine.<\/p>\n<p>Cut one of the quince into 8 wedges. Place one wedge, flat side down, on a cutting board, and use a sharp knife to cut a V-shape in the center, removing the seeds. Repeat with the remaining wedges, placing the prepared wedges in the saucepan as you go. Repeat with the second quince. (You&#8217;ll probably note, by the way, that the flesh begins to brown when it&#8217;s exposed to air, the way the flesh of an apple does; don&#8217;t worry too much, because the discoloration will disappear as the quince cooks.)<\/p>\n<p>Place the saucepan over medium-high heat, and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, and cover the pan loosely with a lid, leaving a small crack for steam to escape. (Since the quince will take a while to cook, you want to keep as much moisture in the pan as possible, but you <em>do<\/em> want to let a\u00a0small amount\u00a0of the liquid evaporate, so that it slowly reduces a bit.) Cook gently until the quince is very tender when pierced with a knife, approximately the texture of a canned pear. This may take as little as 50 minutes or as long as 2 hours, depending on your fruit. (Seneviratne advises that you keep an eye on the pot and add more water if needed to keep the fruit submerged until it&#8217;s ready, though mine didn&#8217;t come anywhere near needing it.)<\/p>\n<p>When the fruit is tender, remove it carefully from the pan to a bowl or storage container, leaving the liquid behind. Fish out the cardamom pods, and discard them. Raise the heat to medium-high and simmer the poaching liquid briskly, stirring frequently, until it has reduced to about one-third of its original volume and is thickened like\u00a0syrup. Pour the syrup over the fruit, and allow to cool completely.<\/p>\n<p>Serve the cooled quince in wedges or slice it thickly, and be sure to drizzle it with syrup.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note<\/em>: Stored in an airtight container, the cooked quince will keep for\u00a0up to a week.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 6 servings<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I first tasted quince the first time I had dinner with my first editor, an exceedingly kind, thoughtful woman of whom I nonetheless was terrified, because she was very New York Publishing World, and because she was my first editor.
