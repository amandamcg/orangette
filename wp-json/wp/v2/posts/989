This is not an unusual condition for me, but it happens particularly often when I\u2019m feeling frazzled or tired or harried, right around the same time that I start listening to the easy listening station on the car radio and feeling genuinely soothed by it. It\u2019s pretty clear that you need a good night\u2019s sleep when <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zrc8XOlJsm0\">\u201cPeaceful Easy Feeling\u201d<\/a> comes on the stereo and you almost choke up, sitting there behind the wheel of your Honda with its missing hubcaps, singing a mournful duet with Glenn Frey as you <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">thump-thump<\/span> over the speed bumps of residential Seattle. It is also pretty clear that you need cake.<\/p>\n<p>The cake up there, the very plain-looking one in the pictures, is not a beauty, but it\u2019s a bang-up solution to the problem. It\u2019s a recipe that I\u2019ve been playing with and tweaking for the past few weeks or so, inspired in part by Miss Edna Lewis\u2019s wonderful <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/02\/like-lullaby.html\">busy-day cake<\/a>. It is my personal conviction that we all need some sort of busy-day cake in our repertoire, and though I love Miss Lewis\u2019s take on the theme, this one, I think, will be mine. It\u2019s rustic and coarse-crumbed, almost like a muffin, with a faint whiff of nutmeg and whole wheat. I\u2019m calling it an \u201ceveryday cake,\u201d and Brandon would like me to clarify that, as cakes go, it\u2019s not strictly dessert material. It\u2019s a snack, ideally, something you would eat with tea or coffee, iced or hot, in the hours between lunch and dinner. It\u2019s homely and humble and not very sweet, and it\u2019s deeply reassuring. If you really know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019ll slice off a wedge, pick it up between your thumb and index finger, lean over the sink, and eat it in approximately four, maybe five, large bites. Pay no attention to the plate and fork in the top photo. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. All you need is the cake.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Everyday Cake<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Inspired by Edna Lewis\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/02\/like-lullaby.html\">Busy-Day Cake<\/a><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2009-04-28T06:57:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/989?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>I don\u2019t ordinarily like baking with whole wheat flour, to be perfectly honest. I am told that this constitutes some sort of major personality flaw, like finding real enjoyment in making babies cry, but I can\u2019t help it. However, that said, when I set out to make this cake, whole wheat flour somehow seemed right. It seemed fitting for an everyday sweet, the kind of thing you would want to snack on, rather than save for after dinner. I had a bag of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kingarthurflour.com\/shop\/items\/king-arthur-white-whole-wheat-flour-5-lb\">white whole wheat flour<\/a> in the fridge, so that\u2019s what I used, and it\u2019s a great product. I combined it with regular all-purpose flour, using equal amounts of each, and the finished cake has a subtly nutty flavor and a hearty texture, which is exactly what I was after.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 stick (4 oz.) unsalted butter, at room temperature\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bc cups granulated sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 large eggs\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tsp. vanilla extract\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 cup white whole wheat flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tsp. baking powder\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bc tsp. salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            A few gratings of nutmeg, or to taste\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd cup whole milk or plain yogurt, at room temperature          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan with butter or cooking spray.<\/p>\n<p>In the bowl of a stand mixer, blend the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy. One by one, add the eggs, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract, and beat to blend.<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.<\/p>\n<p>Add about \u00bc of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, and beat on low speed to incorporate. Add 1\/3 of the milk or yogurt, and beat again. Add the remaining flour mixture in three more doses, alternating each time with a bit of milk or yogurt, and beating to just combine. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and stir to incorporate any flour not yet absorbed.<\/p>\n<p>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly across the top. Bake for about 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (This cake seems to want to brown quickly on top, so after about 20 minutes, you might want to peek into the oven and tent the cake with aluminum foil, if necessary.) Cool in the pan on a rack for 20 minutes; then remove the sides of the pan and continue to cool.<\/p>\n<p>Serve at room temperature. Or slightly warm, if you want.<\/p>\n<p>Note: I store this cake at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap. It\u2019s very good on the first day, but I like it even better on the second. By the third day, it starts to dry out, but it still tastes good.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, I thought it would be nice to talk about cake.
