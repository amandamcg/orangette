I\u2019m the one in the grocery check-out line who\u2019s fervently studying the contents of your cart, the one quietly noting behavior on the bus.

With a sample size of two and no further delay, I\u2019m happy to announce, dear Seattle, that <strong>your children are of unrivaled sophistication<\/strong>. They\u2019re very significant, statistically.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I recently overheard the following conversation between a little girl and a man in the produce department of Whole Foods:<\/p>\n<p><em>Man<\/em>: \u201cWhat kind of apples do you want?\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/><em>Girl<\/em>: <strong>\u201cChocolate apples!\u201d<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/><em>Man<\/em>: \u201cI don\u2019t think they have that kind\u2026.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is a child of unparalleled vision. And thank heavens, because this is just the sort of leader we need in these sorry times. Unfortunately, we\u2019ll have to wait a few years and hope, in the meantime, that she\u2019s not quashed by bland and tiresome adults, such as the inferior specimen accompanying her.<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday night, I had the pleasure of dining with another model of refinement, a towheaded fifteen-month-old named <strong>Eero<\/strong>, the son of my friends Jenny and Thomas. When he\u2019s not having his diaper changed or toddling around with a book in his fists, Eero is putting away spoonfuls of plain yogurt and mounds of roasted broccoli, raw red peppers, mangoes, and persimmons. He loves to drink fizzy water from his mother\u2019s (glass!) cup, and <strong>he even springs for raw fennel, so long as he can take it like a little bird\u2014standing in the kitchen, flapping his arms, stamping his feet with impatience, and opening his mouth wide<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Sunday night was no exception. While Jenny and I bustled around their cozy kitchen, putting the finishing touches on a homemade <a href=\"http:\/\/chocolateandzucchini.com\/archives\/cat_on_a_sugar_high.php#000862\">galette<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/scally.typepad.com\/cest_moi_qui_lai_fait\/2005\/01\/galette_des_roi.html\">des rois<\/a>,* whisking b\u00e9chamel and whipping egg whites for a pumpkin-and-goat-cheese souffl\u00e9, shaving fennel for a salad, and chatting, <strong>Eero played with a head of radicchio <\/strong>and the bowl of the food processor. One should never underestimate the importance of being comfortable in the kitchen from an early age.<\/p>\n<p>While the souffl\u00e9 did its mysterious work in the oven, we sat down for a quick sip of white wine around a gorgeous hors d\u2019oeuvre platter Jenny had improvised before my arrival.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/01\/Smoked-salmon-chez-Burkle.jpg\" width=\"417\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It was stunning: two peppery hunks of salmon, caught and smoked by one of Thomas\u2019s brothers; a pile of thinly shaved apple; a smattering of pomegranate seeds and slices of scallion; and a small bowl containing an ingenious mixture of <strong>mayonnaise, walnut oil, minced scallion, and pomegranate molasses<\/strong>. Listening for the oven timer, we cut thick slices from a crusty loaf of bread and piled them high with salmon, fruit, scallions, and the nutty, punchy mayonnaise. At one corner of the table, chunks of <strong>salmon and bread disappeared at an alarming rate into Eero\u2019s little body<\/strong>. And he wasn\u2019t finished. In the half-hour that followed, he got himself around two and a half servings of pumpkin souffl\u00e9 and some plain yogurt topped with <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/with-my-own-two-hands.html\">apple butter<\/a>. I stared shamelessly. After all, as a kid, <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/11\/to-cherry-pit-spitter-on-her-58th.html\">I was no Eero<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve not yet determined what one must do to produce this sort of \u201c<strong>intrepid palate<\/strong>,\u201d as Jenny calls it. Perhaps there&#8217;s something in the Seattle city water supply? Or a strategic coital position? Further studies and staring will be necessary. But when my time comes, I\u2019m aiming high. I\u2019m aiming for chocolate apples. I\u2019m aiming for Eero.<\/p>\n<p>*Dorie Greenspan\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/0767906810\/qid=1106110117\/sr=2-1\/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1\/104-3792443-4939963\"><em>Paris Sweets<\/em><\/a> strikes <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/01\/sugar-high-friday-4-or-how-i-got-my.html\">again<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Intensive training in anthropology and ethnographic methods has taught me the delicate art of participant observation, and, because it\u2019s a shame to let these things atrophy, I feel compelled to exercise my skills every now and then, or constantly.
