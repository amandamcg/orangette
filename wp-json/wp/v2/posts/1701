Luckily for all of us, the recipe in question should make up for my shortcomings. I started with the best of intentions, and by god, I\u2019ve brought you <strong>a cranberry Linzer tart<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Cranberry_linzer_tart.0.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/12\/Cranberry_linzer_tart.0.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>I hope you\u2019ll see fit to forgive me.<\/p>\n<p>This delectable thing has been making regular appearances on our holiday table for a decade now, since a very snowy, fortuitous, and <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/10\/how-i-hit-hard-ball-stage.html\">fateful<\/a> getaway to the <strong>Wooden Goose Inn<\/strong> in Cape Neddick, Maine. I was only 17, and obviously very impressionable. The innkeepers, two unabashed gourmands by the name of Tony and Jerry, treat their guests to elaborate breakfasts and teas each day, and we quickly fell under the sway of their kitchen. <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/10\/how-i-hit-hard-ball-stage.html\">I\u2019ve already written a paean<\/a> to their elegant but buckle-busting breakfasts, but tea-time left us equally wide-eyed and weak-kneed. I wasted no time in choosing a favorite among the array of homemade tarts and pastries, and ten years later, I haven\u2019t budged an inch. For me, each afternoon in Maine meant a rich, black cup of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.carpediemcoffee.com\/\">coffee<\/a> and a hefty wedge of cranberry Linzer tart, <strong>sweet, sour, and almost spicy<\/strong>, in a sandy almond crust fragrant with cinnamon, cloves, and orange peel. And today, for my mother and me, each holiday season means an afternoon of measuring cups and a full, hefty pan of cranberry Linzer tart.<\/p>\n<p>So this Thanksgiving, I got <strong>my fix of Mom, man, and tart<\/strong>. My mother kindly cast a blind eye to all our cutesy carrying-on, and in return, Brandon\u2014bless his huge, thumping heart\u2014charmed her with brown-butter mashed potatoes and daily doses of his trademark fennel salad, weeded out her old pots and pans and a few dead electronics, and plowed through her pantry full of old, rancid oils and crusty vinegars. Were I less susceptible to so much delicious distraction, I would have chronicled every second. But instead, I sat back, gave a lot of thanks, and ate a lot of Linzer tart.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cranberry Linzer Tart<br \/><\/strong>Adapted from the Wooden Goose Inn<\/p>\n<p>This beauty may look like a lot of work, but it comes together quite simply. First and foremost, keep in mind that the lattice top is only as complicated as you want to make it. We don\u2019t usually bother with a lot of fancy weaving; just lay a few strips of dough in one direction, and then lay a second layer on top, perpendicular to the first. If you\u2019re feeling especially festive, you could even try topping the tart with a mosaic of cookie-cutter shapes instead of a traditional lattice. It\u2019s the holidays, after all, so you\u2019re allowed to get a little schmaltzy.<\/p>\n<p><em>For the filling:<br \/><\/em>2 cups granulated sugar<br \/>\u00be cup cold water, divided<br \/>12 ounces fresh cranberries, picked over and rinsed<br \/>\u00bd cup golden raisins<br \/>1 tsp grated orange peel<br \/>2 Tbs cornstarch<\/p>\n<p><em>For the crust:<\/em><br \/>1 \u00bd cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>1 \u00bd cups toasted almonds, finely ground<br \/>\u00be cup granulated sugar<br \/>1 tsp ground cinnamon<br \/>1 tsp grated orange peel<br \/>\u00bc tsp ground cloves<br \/>A pinch of salt<br \/>6 Tbs unsalted butter, at room temperature<br \/>2 egg yolks, beaten with 1 Tbs water<br \/>Water, as needed<\/p>\n<p>Whipped cream, for serving<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Cranberry_burbling.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/12\/Cranberry_burbling.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><em>To make the filling<\/em>, combine the sugar and \u00bd cup water in a medium saucepan. Put the pan over medium heat, and stir until the sugar has dissolved. The mixture will look cloudy. Stir in the cranberries, raisins, and orange peel. Bring the mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until the cranberries pop, about 6 minutes. In a small bowl, blend the cornstarch with the remaining \u00bc cup water, and stir it into the cranberry mixture. Set the saucepan aside, and allow the filling to cool completely. It will thicken as it cools.*<\/p>\n<p><em>To make the crust<\/em>, preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. In a food processor, combine the flour, ground almonds, sugar, cinnamon, orange peel, cloves, and salt. Add the butter, and process until the mixture is crumbly. With the machine running, add the egg yolks mixed with water, and process until combined. Squeeze a handful of the dough in your fist; if it is still on the dry, crumbly side, add little splashes of water\u2014about a \u00bd Tbs at a time\u2014with the machine running, continuing to pulse the dough until it coheres nicely to itself when squeezed. This dough is pretty forgiving, and you need not really worry about overworking it. Reserve 1 \u00bd cups of the dough for the lattice top. Press the remaining dough evenly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9\u201d removable-bottom tart pan. Bake it for 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p><em>To assemble the tart<\/em>, spoon the cooled cranberry filling into the crust. On a clean surface, pat and roll the remaining 1 \u00bd cups crust dough into a flat circle about \u00bc inch thick. With a pairing knife, cut the circle into rough \u00be-inch strips. Working carefully\u2014the dough is delicate\u2014overlay the strips to form a lattice on top of the filling. Bake the finished tart for 30 minutes, until nicely browned. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature, preferably with lightly sweetened and loosely whipped cream.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">*Note: The cooled filling should have the consistency of a chunky chutney or jam. If you find it a tad loose, as we did this year, simply spoon out some of the excess liquid until you reach the desired consistency; then spoon the filling into the crust.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Yield: 8-10 servings<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I started with the best of intentions.
