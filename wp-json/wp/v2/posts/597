She\u2019d found the recipe in the April issue of <i>Saveur<\/i>, the sandwich issue, where it was featured in a spread about salad sandwiches. (Photograph included! <i>Avert your eyes<\/i>!) I had already read the magazine and put it away without noticing the recipe, and to be honest, even if I had noticed it, I don\u2019t know that I would have given it a second thought: <i>Russian egg and mushroom salad<\/i>, it was called, with dill and caramelized onions. Apparently, I am prone to provincialism in my egg saladry, because I had never heard of an egg salad like that. I grew up under the roof of a man who loved egg salad and made it nearly every Saturday, but the farthest he ever ventured from the home territory of egg, mayo, mustard, and salt was an occasional visit to the curry powder jar. I couldn\u2019t grasp the idea of egg salad with mushrooms and caramelized onions. That mental trick that a lot of us cooks do, the one where we read a list of ingredients and then conjure up, in our mind\u2019s mouth, what the resulting flavor might be &#8211; well, the trick didn\u2019t work on this salad. But Sarah had called the recipe a keeper, and she even used double exclamation points(!!), and so, without really understanding what I was making, I was excited to make it. I put some eggs on to boil.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/2dec9-polamushroomsforsalad-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5604193361510431554\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/2dec9-polamushroomsforsalad-11.jpg?w=249\" alt=\"\" width=\"1060\" height=\"1279\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThis is not a recipe with a long, involved origin story. The story of this recipe is, in short: I made it. I ate it. I made it again. I ate it again. And when I started thinking about making it a third time, I wrote to Sarah to ask if I could tell you about it &#8211; if for no other reason than to believe that we might not be the only two people in the world wanting to eat this much egg salad.<\/p>\n<p>The recipe is as simple as you might guess. You cook some roughly chopped mushrooms in a skillet until they smell good enough that you\u2019re forced to make a piece of toast to tide you over while you stand there, stirring. Then you scrape them into a bowl, put the skillet back on the heat, and lightly caramelize some roughly chopped onions in it. (Don\u2019t worry if you lose track of time while you\u2019re eating your toast and the onions brown too quickly; mine did, and still, the salad rose above.) Then you add the onions to the bowl, along with some chopped egg and fresh dill, and you dress it with a bright, quickly whisked-up sauce of mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice &#8211; a sauce that, should you have extra, makes a bang-up dip for asparagus. Then you pile it on a(nother) piece of toast while the whole mixture is still a little warm, and you put a napkin in your lap, because what\u2019s about to happen deserves some ceremony. And then you have lunch.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\"> Russian Egg and Mushroom Salad<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\"> Adapted from <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.saveur.com\/\">Saveur<\/a><\/i>, and from Anya von Bremzen\u2019s <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPlease-Table-Anya-von-Bremzen%2Fdp%2F0894807536&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">Please to the Table: The Russian Cookbook<\/a><\/i><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2011-05-11T01:33:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/597?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>The original recipe called for white button mushrooms, but because I like crimini mushrooms more, that\u2019s what I chose.
