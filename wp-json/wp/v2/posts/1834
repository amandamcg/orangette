He loves dancing backwards and he shakes his hips with a fair amount of awkwardness and he does that odd neck-dancing thing he\u2019s been doing for years and he makes funny rhythmic movements with his arms floating out from his sides and his eyes get big as globes when he wiggles in his overalls and when he sings loudly and strongly and opera-like his face spreads into an otherworldly grin and it\u2019s almost as though he\u2019s left and gone somewhere else, and <strong>there we are together<\/strong>. My halter top and I danced ourselves damp and Keats\u2019 blond ponytail was bouncing and her big boots thumping, and I kept looking over to see if she was as irrationally caught up in it all as I was, and at one point we turned to each other, dancing, and smiled so wide <strong>we thought our faces might split <\/strong>and she made a motion with her hands like invisible tears were rolling down her aching cheeks, and David looked so happy and so genuinely moved by all of us down below him, adoring. Oh, it is good to be so silly and adoring at a David Byrne show. I almost cried again when he played \u201cThe Great Intoxication,\u201d and you would have too. It&#8217;s so beautiful. I would say I\u2019m ridiculous, but I\u2019m not.<\/p>\n<p>But, dear reader, I am going to try my hardest not to write any more about Major Genius Mr. Byrne.
