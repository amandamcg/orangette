I\u2019ve hemmed and hawed, mostly because the topic is fraught with mines and quicksand and very, very strong opinions. I am a new parent with a child who has only been eating solids for about six months. I am not an expert. \u00a0No noooo <i>NOOOOOOO<\/i>. \u00a0I am also keenly aware that my perspective would be different if my child or I had a food allergy or intolerance, or if my child were very picky. What I\u2019m trying to say is: my perspective doesn\u2019t mean much.<\/p>\n<p>That said, I know that <i>I <\/i>really enjoy reading about other parents\u2019 approaches to feeding their kids. I find it helpful. Sometimes stressful, but often helpful, insightful, and even galvanizing. Maybe you find it helpful, too? \u00a0So, maybe, if I do write a bit about my approach to feeding June, we can all agree to stay cool about it and understand that I do not claim to know anything about any child but my own?<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e8bfc-9f7a03391.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e8bfc-9f7a03391.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>To be honest, I try not to think too hard. \u00a0I assume that if June is getting some fruits, some vegetables, some fat, and some protein most days, she\u2019s going to be all right. Ever since she was born, I\u2019ve had this sense &#8211; I can\u2019t explain it without sounding all new-age-y and annoying; get out your crystals, folks! &#8211; that June is going to be okay. That goes generally, across the board. I hope I never have to second-guess it. When it comes to feeding her, I try to avoid any guidelines or quantities, because they keep me up at night. \u00a0The way I see it, my job is to offer a reasonable variety of foods, the kind of stuff that Brandon and I eat, and June\u2019s job is to choose which parts to eat and how much. I don\u2019t cajole when she doesn\u2019t want to eat, and I don\u2019t praise her when she does. Sometimes she eats like a pack of wild dogs, and sometimes, like tonight, she eats only a few bites. I\u2019m sure that there are many picky moments to come, and maybe even picky weeks, months, or years. If there is one thing that I am trying to remember in my young career as a parent, it\u2019s that whatever is true today may not be true tomorrow. And I want food to be something fun that we can share, not a source of strife. \u00a0I have to lay the foundations for that.<\/p>\n<p>My approach to feeding June has been shaped in large part by two people: my friend Matthew Amster-Burton, author of <a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Hungry-Monkey-Food-Loving-Fathers-Adventurous\/dp\/B004KAB40Q\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Hungry Monkey<\/a>, and Nina Planck, author of <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Real-Food-Mother-Baby-Fertility\/dp\/1596913940\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=real%20food%20for%20mother%20and%20baby&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1389850463&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Real Food for Mother and Baby<\/a><\/i>. (I read the latter while I was pregnant, and it also had a big impact on how I decided to eat during pregnancy, and how I eat now.) \u00a0For me, the big take-away from Matthew\u2019s book is this: <i>there is no such thing as baby food.<\/i>\u00a0And that dovetails nicely, I think, with Nina Planck\u2019s viewpoint, which is roughly this: <i>Whole foods are best. Cereals are not great first foods, because babies\u2019 bodies aren\u2019t able to break down complex starches. Babies need fat and protein. And mostly, babies &#8211; and mothers &#8211; need good, simple food<\/i>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4881a-9f7a03421.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4881a-9f7a03421.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>June tasted her first solid food around five months, when I let her suck on some raw apple that I had sliced for myself. I also gave her tastes of my favorite\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/strausfamilycreamery.com\/products\/item\/organic-plain-yogurt\" target=\"_blank\">whole-milk plain yogurt<\/a>, parsnip soup, split pea soup, avocado, pizza crust, chana masala, and a bunch of other foods from our plates. Neither Brandon nor I have food allergies, and our doctor was pretty laid-back on the topic of first foods. He suggested that we be careful with citrus and strawberries, which apparently can cause reactions, but otherwise, he explained that the guidelines for first foods change so often that it\u2019s hard for him to get strongly behind any of them. As it happened, June wasn\u2019t really interested in solids until she was about 10 months old, at which point she had teeth and could handle a decent variety of textures. Over a couple of months, she started eating more &#8220;real&#8221; meals and nursing less. I introduced her to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freshbreezeorganic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">whole cow\u2019s milk<\/a> when she was just under a year old, and I weaned her from the breast completely about a month ago, at 15 months.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7fce5-9f7a03461.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7fce5-9f7a03461.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I salt June\u2019s food as we salt our own. \u00a0I try not to give her a lot of sweet things &#8211; not because I think I can mold her into a non-sweets-craving person (haa <i>haaaa, <\/i>RIIIIIIIIIGHT), but mostly because I know she will want to eat the living crap out of them, and I want her to save room for other things. I would like her to grow up understanding that there is no such thing as <i>bad<\/i> food: that some foods are better for our bodies, yes, and some food isn\u2019t food at all (like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Worlds-Largest-Box-Nerds-Candy\/dp\/B007W6BBJO\" target=\"_blank\">Nerds<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Haribo-Gummi-Candy-Sghetti-5-Ounce\/dp\/B000EVT06U\" target=\"_blank\">sour gummies<\/a>, both of which I would currently kill for), but that there is time enough for all of it. I want her to know that food is about pleasure and connection <i>and<\/i> sustenance.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes she eats everything we give her. Other times, she won\u2019t touch something that she loved only the day before. Sometimes she throws her food on the floor. Sometimes she feeds it to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/7756047780\/in\/set-72157627711600121\" target=\"_blank\">Alice<\/a>. Sometimes she feeds it to us. Sometimes she spits it out and plays with it and then puts it back in her mouth and eats it. In any case, I try not to respond. I don\u2019t try to make her eat. If she can feed herself, I let her. \u00a0She\u2019s in charge of how much she eats. She knows a few signs &#8211; <i>food, water, milk, more, please<\/i> &#8211; and she can tell me when she is hungry or thirsty. I try not to hover or push or freak out. I try. I really try.<\/p>\n<p>So far, June\u2019s favorite foods are milk, fruit, and meat. \u00a0She would probably drink milk and eat bananas and brisket all day, if I let her. \u00a0But she also loves <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewednesdaychef.com\/the_wednesday_chef\/2013\/07\/cooking-for-hugo-pastina-for-dinner.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hugo\u2019s pastina<\/a>, any meat that\u2019s fall-apart tender, scrambled eggs, cold pepperoni, Brandon\u2019s pizza, pasta with our friend <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gourmet.com\/food\/2009\/06\/an-eggplant-confession\" target=\"_blank\">Francis Lam\u2019s eggplant sauce<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bonappetit.com\/recipe\/spaghetti-and-meatballs\" target=\"_blank\">Cafe Lago meatballs<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2013\/11\/please-consider.html\" target=\"_blank\">ham bone soup<\/a>, pasta with Bolognese, French fries, prosciutto, a cannellini bean and lamb soup that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leciawphinney.com\/2012\/11\/monday-morning.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lecia<\/a> made, and Ed Fretwell Soup from my first book. I try to always keep peas in the freezer and a roasted sweet potato in the fridge, and when I can, I make a big batch of homemade applesauce. At the end of summer, she was way into berries, and somewhat into roasted zucchini. Lately, she\u2019s into roasted Brussels sprouts, slightly mushy steamed broccoli, and oranges. \u00a0She likes rice and beans, and pho. Most mornings, she eats whole-milk plain yogurt and fruit, or some <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2014\/01\/a-good-person-to-know.html\" target=\"_blank\">oatmeal<\/a>. Yesterday, we had <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2010\/01\/very-definition.html\" target=\"_blank\">oatmeal pancakes<\/a>\u00a0&#8211;\u00a0which, when cold, also make a good midday snack with a slice of cheddar cheese. For dessert, she\u2019s a big fan of graham crackers, or half a banana and some peanut butter. We offer her water with every meal &#8211; from a cup, a cup with a straw, or a bottle; whatever is around &#8211; and we save milk for first thing in the morning, naptime, and bedtime, or else she fills up. I think June would want me to add, just for the sake of completeness, that she is not a fan of avocado, fish, or seafood. And she refuses to swallow any kind of winter squash. She likes bread, but so far only as a toy. And that is the truth according to June on this day, January 15, 2014.<\/p>\n<p>I hope this is helpful? \u00a0Or, at least, I hope this didn\u2019t make you feel like I feel, which is to say, totally preoccupied with getting your hands on some sour gummies? \u00a0Either way, I guess we\u2019re in it together. xx<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>First things first: if you don\u2019t want to read about kid stuff, you should skip this post.
