Actually, it\u2019s a huge piece of news, but calling it little makes it feel more manageable. Brandon is opening a restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>My heart stopped for a second, just typing that.<\/p>\n<p>When I met him about 3 \u00bd years ago, Brandon was a graduate student in music composition.  Actually, if we\u2019re getting down to the nitty-gritties, he was a graduate student in music composition until last March, when he went on leave to focus on the restaurant full-time.  It may seem like a strange transition to make, but he has been working in restaurants since he was a teenager, and cooking isn\u2019t all that different, conceptually, from writing music.  The work itself is certainly not the same, but both are creative processes, ways of taking separate elements and arranging them, balancing and tweaking, to make something new.  Anyway, those of us who know him \u2013 which, in a sense, includes all of you \u2013 know that he loves food.  The man can run circles around me in the kitchen.  I like to cook, yes, but he <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">is<\/span> a cook.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/dc9fe-pizzaatruths1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/dc9fe-pizzaatruths1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272123758605246722\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>He is also <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/09\/di-fara-pizza-and-exaggeration-that.html\">obsessed<\/a> with pizza.  As a grade-schooler, he used to go to a pizzeria near his parents\u2019 house in New Jersey and pepper the owner with questions about dough and mozzarella. When I met him, he lived on the Upper West Side, but he trekked out to the middle of Brooklyn at least once a week to wait patiently in line at DiFara.  Last year, he agreed to drive a car from San Antonio to Los Angeles just so he could try the pizza at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mozza-la.com\/\">Mozza<\/a>, and he took an overnight trip to Phoenix for the sole purpose of eating at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pizzeriabianco.com\/\">Pizzeria Bianco<\/a>.  So when he told me that he wanted to <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">make<\/span> pizza, it didn\u2019t exactly surprise me.  It may have scared me a little, but it didn\u2019t surprise me.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/1f65f-polapizzajune16-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/1f65f-polapizzajune16-11.jpg?w=298\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272124329739085058\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>The wheels have been in motion for quite a while \u2013 over a year, I think \u2013 but he signed a lease on Friday, so we feel ready now to say something here. We wanted to go ahead and share it with you, because we\u2019re excited.  And also, you know, a little scared, which seems only sane.  But mainly, we\u2019re excited.  I hesitate to say too much today, but I can tell you that the restaurant will be here in Seattle, in our neighborhood. The windows are covered with plastic right now, and the door is kind of garish and wonky, but it\u2019ll be prettier soon, I promise.  If you squint hard enough, you might get a sense of it.  Or see a dolphin tail.  You never know.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/23466-pola141570thstreet1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/23466-pola141570thstreet1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272135287619267778\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>I say that the restaurant is Brandon\u2019s, because it is: it\u2019s his baby, his vision, his sweat.  But I will be there too, helping where I can, and the menu, which I can\u2019t wait to show you, is a real combination of his style and mine.  It is inspired by two of our favorite restaurants: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zunicafe.com\/\">Zuni Caf\u00e9<\/a>, in San Francisco, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boatstreetcafe.com\/\">Boat Street Caf\u00e9 and Kitchen<\/a>, where Brandon has worked for the past two and a half years, since he moved to Seattle.  It happens, yes, that the emphasis will be on pizza, but there will also be wood-fired vegetables from local farmers, seasonal salads, charcuterie, and rustic desserts, the kind I like to make at home.  I can\u2019t wait.<\/p>\n<p>There is a lot of work ahead, no doubt, but he plans to open in the springtime.  Hopefully early spring, though we\u2019ll see.  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Homemade-Life-Stories-Recipes-Kitchen\/dp\/1416551050\">My book<\/a> comes out on March 3, so our heads are sort of exploding at the moment.   But don\u2019t worry!  We have a lot of help.  Susan Kaplan of Boat Street has been a hugely generous mentor, and <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/09\/hello-finally.html\">our friend Carla Leonardi<\/a> of Caf\u00e9 Lago has spent hours with us at the oven and in the kitchen.  And my brother David, who owns five(!) <a href=\"http:\/\/dccoast.com\/\">restaurants<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tenpenh.com\/main.htm\">in<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ceibarestaurant.com\/\">the<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.acadianarestaurant.com\/\">DC<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.passionfishreston.com\/\">area<\/a>, calls to check in and field questions and cheer, which makes me so happy that I feel kind of weepy right now.<\/p>\n<p>I know there are a lot of details missing from this story, but I will tell you more as I can.  In the meantime, thank you, always, for being here, and for believing in me, in him, and in us.  I\u2019ll see you back here on December 8, once we\u2019ve had time to take some deep breaths, sleep in, cook Thanksgiving dinner, wander around New York and eat pizza, and get ready for what comes next.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi, all.
