Oh, I do like a cup of coffee every now and then, as well as the occasional mug of hot water with a slice of lemon on top, but aside from that, meh, I could take it or leave it.  Part of the problem, I think, is that I\u2019m forever burning my tongue. It\u2019s a tender little bugger.  Having burned it so many times, I hardly even want hot drinks anymore.  If I\u2019m going to burn the darned thing, I figure, it should be for something more substantial, more filling, than just a dinky cup of coffee or tea.  (No offense, of course, to you coffee and tea aficionados. Anyway, this means more for you!  Hooray!)<\/p>\n<p>But then &#8211; because, you know, there\u2019s always a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">but then<\/span> &#8211; a couple of weeks ago, quite out of the blue, I had a craving for hot chocolate. (And mulled cider.  But mainly hot chocolate.)  You can imagine what a shock this was.  I hardly even remember the last time I had hot chocolate.  It was a few years ago, at least.  I think it might have been when I was a student in Paris.  My mother was visiting, and it was cold outside, and we went to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ladur%C3%A9e\">Ladur\u00e9e<\/a>.  We ordered a small pot of coffee and the same of hot chocolate, and when they came, on a whim, we poured them together, mixing them into our dainty cups. The result was <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">exquisite<\/span>. We felt like geniuses. The cherubs on the frescoed ceiling even smiled down kindly upon us.  But despite all that, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had hot chocolate since.  Or not more than a sip of someone else\u2019s, anyway.  I just never think of it.<\/p>\n<p>Isn\u2019t that sad? All that wasted time &#8211; that precious, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">precious<\/span> time.  Oh woe.  I tear up just thinking about it.  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Sob.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5a771-hotchocolate032-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5a771-hotchocolate032-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5152244813100416274\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Which is why I thank my lucky stars today for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.doriegreenspan.com\/dorie_greenspan\/\">Dorie Greenspan<\/a>, for her <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Paris-Sweets-Great-Desserts-Pastry\/dp\/0767906810\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Paris Sweets<\/span><\/a>, for the hot chocolate recipe it contains, and for craving that called me to it.   <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Phew.  <\/span><span>From this day forth, I have lots of catching up to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/a2dcd-hotchocolate039-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/a2dcd-hotchocolate039-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5152244821690350882\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>There are loads of hot chocolate recipes out there, but this one, adapted from none other than Ladur\u00e9e, is my tippy-top, honest-to-goodness ideal.  The best part is that it has only four ingredients, and that they\u2019re simple pantry types: milk, water, sugar, and chocolate.  You warm them together in a saucepan, easy-peasy, and then, when the mixture is hot, whip it with an immersion blender until it\u2019s smooth and frothy &#8211; like a proper cappuccino, you could say, only way better, because this is <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">chocolate<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>In a lineup of hot chocolates, this one would stand somewhere in the middle, which is just where I like it.  It\u2019s medium-bodied &#8211; thicker than <a href=\"http:\/\/www.conagrafoods.com\/consumer\/brands\/getBrand.do?page=swiss_miss\">Swiss Miss<\/a>, but not so sludgy that you could stand up a spoon in it.  Likewise, it\u2019s richer than your average specimen, but not so rich that you feel compelled to pace your sips, break out in a sweat, sleep it off, and\/or die afterwards.  I know a lot of people who love the <a href=\"http:\/\/travel.nytimes.com\/2007\/12\/02\/travel\/02weekend.html\">hot chocolate at City Bakery<\/a> in New York, but to my way of thinking, this one is even better.  It\u2019s more moderate, richness-wise &#8211; a little more <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">sustainable<\/span>, for lack of a better word &#8211; but still, it pushes all the right buttons.  In fact, after his second sip, Brandon proclaimed that he wanted to swim in it.  That says it all, I think.  I just hope there\u2019s room in the pool for two.  I plan to spend the rest of the winter there.<\/p>\n<p>***<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and speaking of winter, I wanted to tell you about a <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">cooking class<\/span>(!) that Brandon and I will be co-teaching later this month, on the topic of winter produce.  The class will be held in Bellingham, at <a href=\"http:\/\/inthekitchenbellingham.blogspot.com\/\">In the Kitchen<\/a>, a new venture for Ciao Thyme, the caterers of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/08\/so-we-feasted.html\">our wedding<\/a>.  We are over-the-moon honored that they\u2019ve invited us to teach in their <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">stunning<\/span> new kitchen.  Our class is scheduled for <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Tuesday, January 29, at 6:30 pm<\/span>.  We\u2019ll be sharing techniques and recipes for some of our favorite misunderstood vegetables &#8211; fennel, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower  &#8211; and we just can\u2019t wait.  You can find more information and sign up <a style=\"font-weight:bold;\" href=\"http:\/\/gabrielboone.com\/class_calendars\/ITK_Class_Calendar_2008_Q1.pdf\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>(And if you can\u2019t make it this time, we\u2019ll also be teaching a class on eggs &#8211; poached, boiled, beaten into mayonnaise, whipped into souffl\u00e9, you name it &#8211; on March 18. You can learn more right <a href=\"http:\/\/gabrielboone.com\/class_calendars\/ITK_Class_Calendar_2008_Q1.pdf\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Hot Chocolate<\/span><br \/>Adapted from Dorie Greenspan\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Paris-Sweets-Great-Desserts-Pastry\/dp\/0767906810\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Paris Sweets<\/span><\/a> and Ladur\u00e9e<\/p>\n<p>The original version of this recipe uses twice as much of each ingredient listed below, serving four people.  To make it more friendly for my household, I\u2019ve halved it to serve two. But feel free, of course, to multiply the amounts to serve four or six or however many you want.  Whatever you do, don\u2019t be tempted to skip the blending step.  It helps to incorporate the chocolate and makes the texture velvety-smooth.<\/p>\n<p>My favorite chocolate for this is Scharffen Berger 70%.  Use any bittersweet chocolate you like, but keep in mind that it should be one you love, since its flavor takes center stage.<\/p>\n<p>1 \u00bd cups whole milk<br \/>2 \u00bd Tbsp. water<br \/>2 \u00bd Tbsp. granulated sugar<br \/>3 oz. bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped<\/p>\n<p>In a medium saucepan, combine the milk, water, and sugar.  Place over medium heat and whisk occasionally until the sugar is dissolved. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture just to a boil.  Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the chocolate.  At this point, blend the mixture.  If you have an immersion blender, you can do this directly in the saucepan; if not, you\u2019ll need to transfer it to a traditional blender.  Either way, blend for 1 minute (on high speed, if using a traditional blender &#8211; and take care(!), as hot liquids expand when blended).  The finished mixture should be very smooth and frothy.<\/p>\n<p>Serve immediately.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Note<\/span>: Should you have any leftover hot chocolate &#8211; wishful thinking, I know &#8211; you can store in the refrigerator for 2 days.  Reheat it gently over low heat, stirring occasionally, until hot.  Blend for 1 minute; then serve immediately.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 2 servings<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve never been a big one for hot beverages.
