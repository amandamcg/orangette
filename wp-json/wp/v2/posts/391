As he explains, the &#8220;supple richness&#8221; of the fried egg is meant to offset the heat. \u00a0What I like about it, other than the fact that it<\/span><span style=\"background-color: white;\">\u2019s fragrant and bright and hot, is that it<\/span><span style=\"background-color: white;\">\u2019s nearly instant. \u00a0You can make it in less than ten minutes, with ingredients that you might well have lying around. \u00a0The original recipe calls for <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ocimum_tenuiflorum\" target=\"_blank\">holy basil<\/a>, but I used regular basil. \u00a0I used beef, but Matthew likes pork. \u00a0And if you can<\/span><span style=\"background-color: white;\">\u2019t find Thai chiles, you could easily substitute serranos. \u00a0The important part is hard to mess up, and that<\/span><span style=\"background-color: white;\">\u2019s chewy, saucy union of rice, egg yolk, and beef.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Stir-fried Minced Beef with Chiles and Basil<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootsandgrubs.com\/2011\/11\/01\/pork-and-rice\/\">Matthew-Amster Burton<\/a> and <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Thai-Street-Food-David-Thompson\/dp\/158008284X\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1338012181&amp;camp=1789&amp;sr=8-1&amp;creative=9325\">Thai Street Food<\/a><\/i>, by David Thompson<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2012-06-18T22:39:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/391?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>In Thailand, the eggs would be fried in the wok, either before or after cooking the rest of the dish.

I used five chiles the first time I made this, and it was pleasantly fiery. The second time I made it, I was eating solo and decided to go a little milder, so I used only three chiles. (You can always remove some of the seeds, too.) \u00a0Oh, and if you have an exhaust fan over your stove, turn it on. I always forget until the chiles hit the hot wok and I have a coughing fit.<\/p>\n<p>Also note: this dish comes together very, very quickly, so be sure that you\u2019ve measured out and prepped your ingredients and have them close at hand.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 to 4 large garlic cloves, chopped\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            4 to 10 Thai (also called bird\u2019s eye) chiles, sliced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            A pinch of salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 Tbsp. peanut oil, divided\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            6 oz.
