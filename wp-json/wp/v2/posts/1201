The party was ostensibly to celebrate her new backyard &#8211; she moved a couple of months ago &#8211; and our newly arrived summer weather, but between you and me, I think it was just an excuse for icy drinks and corn on the cob.  (Which I really can\u2019t fault her for.)  We all chipped in and brought six-packs of beer, and I made two batches of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/05\/safe-to-proceed.html\">fresh mint ice cream<\/a>, and once the sun went down, the tables were lit with tea lights in old jars.   It was 85 degrees outside, and Olaiya wore a foxy little dress, and the night was so pretty that not even a stain on the tablecloth from spilled beer, or strawberry margarita, or whatever it was, could mar it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/155fa-polastrawberrymargarita1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/155fa-polastrawberrymargarita1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5217504739392374050\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Olaiya is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.olaiyalandcatering.com\/home.html\">a caterer<\/a>, so she makes these sorts of things look maddeningly easy.  For dinner, she made fresh salmon burgers with radishes and red onions, and she covered a platter with sliced tomatoes and slivered basil, and there was an enormous bowl of corn on the cob with butter and lime.  For his part, Olaiya\u2019s boyfriend John made some excellent margaritas, both regular and the aforementioned strawberry, and though I am a lightweight of almost comical proportions, somehow they didn\u2019t even make me tipsy, which pleased me so much that I had to tell everyone how not-tipsy I was, which, in retrospect, probably means that I was tipsy. Either way, it was a gold star party all around.  Also, when it came time to play Who Would You Rather, I managed to come up with the following doozy: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Johnny_Cash\">Johnny Cash<\/a>, or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.collider.com\/uploads\/imageGallery\/Walk%20the%20Line\/walk_the_line_movie_image__2_.jpg\">Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash<\/a>?  (Go ahead and take a minute to think about it.  It\u2019s tough.)<\/p>\n<p>But the very best part of the evening was one of its smallest details: the basil aioli.  It was the unofficial theme of the party &#8211; a benevolent sort of stealth weapon, I guess you could say, sneaking its way into everything.  While we waited for the grill to heat, it served as a dip for tiny carrots, radishes, snap peas, and potato chips, and as a finishing topknot for deviled eggs.  I spread some on the bun for my salmon burger, and it was delicious, too, on a slice of tomato or a bite of corn on the cob.  (I even contemplated sneaking some into my bag to bring home, since it was already finding its way into everything, but I decided to be polite.)  It was such a simple, subtle touch, but I couldn\u2019t help thinking it was something that we all &#8211; you, me, everybody &#8211; should have in the arsenal.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/3beb5-polabasilaioli1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/3beb5-polabasilaioli1.jpg?w=298\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5217717732246129474\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>So yesterday, I made Brandon teach me how to make it.  He had made a big batch a couple of weeks earlier, for one of Olaiya\u2019s catering gigs, and it wasn\u2019t too hard to scale down, tasting and tweaking.  Essentially, you make a slurry of olive oil, basil leaves, garlic, lemon, and salt &#8211; very much like pesto, minus the pine nuts and parmesan &#8211; and then stir it into your favorite mayonnaise.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I am very partial to homemade mayonnaise.  I like it so much, in fact, that I am inclined argue that it\u2019s not even in the same species as store-bought.  But sometimes I cannot be bothered.  We were short on time this weekend, and our kitchen is currently very hot, so for the sake of instant gratification, and so that we wouldn\u2019t kill each other, we used the commercial kind.  (Anyway, when you\u2019re making flavored mayonnaise, it often isn\u2019t worth it to start from scratch, because all those soft, delicate nuances will be covered up anyway.  It strikes me that this might be veering dangerously in the direction of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.semihomemade.com\/\">Sandra Lee<\/a>, but I think it\u2019s perfectly fair.)  Folded together with basil puree, the mayonnaise turned a pale shade of seafoam green, which looked impossibly elegant &#8211; almost Martha-esque! next up: topiaries! &#8211; on the end of a carrot.  And it tasted just as you would imagine: cooling and creamy and, in a word, summery.  I\u2019m thinking burgers, here, people, and chicken salads, and grilled salmon, and tomato sandwiches, and BLTs.  I\u2019m thinking Fourth of July.  I can\u2019t wait.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Shortcut Basil Aioli<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I used Best Foods \u2013 also sold as Hellman\u2019s \u2013 mayonnaise for this recipe.  It\u2019s the brand I grew up with, and I think it has great flavor.<\/p>\n<p>2 Tbsp. olive oil<br \/>\u00bc cup packed basil leaves<br \/>\u00bd tsp. lemon juice<br \/>1 medium garlic clove, pressed<br \/>Pinch of salt<br \/>\u00bd cup mayonnaise, either <a href=\"http:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/HOMEMADE-MAYONNAISE-241868\">homemade<\/a> or commercial<\/p>\n<p>In the jar of a blender (or a small food processor), combine the olive oil, basil, lemon juice, garlic, and salt.  Process until the mixture is smooth like pesto, pausing every now and then to scrape down the side of the blender jar with a small spatula or knife.<\/p>\n<p>Put the mayonnaise in a small bowl.  Add the basil mixture, and stir well to mix.<\/p>\n<p>Serve as a dip for raw vegetables, spread onto sandwiches, folded into chicken salad, or dolloped on top of deviled eggs (minus the paprika and hot sauce, preferably).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Note<\/span>: This recipe doubles very easily. However, don\u2019t automatically double the amount of garlic and salt called for here; start with the quantities for a single batch, and then add more to taste.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: a little more than \u00bd cup<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apparently, I am a little bit fickle.
