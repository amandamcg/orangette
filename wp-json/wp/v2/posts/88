We found our habits. If the sun was out, we\u2019d walk up to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seattle.gov\/neighborhoods\/ppatch\/\" target=\"_blank\">P-Patch<\/a> at 60th and 3rd and ogle people\u2019s tomatoes and dahlias; if it was raining, I\u2019d drag him for a quick loop around the block; and if it was evening, dark already but not too cold, we\u2019d walk a big rectangle through east Ballard so that I could look through the lit-up windows of the bungalows we passed as families cooked and sat down to dinner. I often dreaded walking the dog, especially in the fall and winter, when it gets dark so early, but once we were out and in a rhythm, the glowing squares of those windows would keep me going &#8211; <i>we\u2019ll turn for home after we pass the next house, or, wait, the next one<\/i> &#8211; and so would the smells that filtered out to the street. I remember one night when I caught what was surely the scent of banana bread baking, another when someone was clearly burning garlic, and another when a whole block of 7th Avenue smelled like ripe apples. Or maybe it was applesauce cooking? Maybe I\u2019d passed under an apple tree? It was too dark to tell.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/53526-dsc_59601.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/53526-dsc_59601.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"424\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>We live closer to the water now, about a quarter mile from Puget Sound, and if the air smells like anything, it smells like saltwater. I imagine that will always feel novel to me, having grown up in a city where the nearest beach was, I don\u2019t know, 500 miles away. I don\u2019t walk much after dark now, because Brandon is working and June is asleep in her crib and Jack is an old man. I\u2019m usually doing something like I\u2019m doing tonight: sitting on the sofa with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/sets\/72157627711600121\/\" target=\"_blank\">Alice<\/a>, avoiding the dirty laundry by drinking a Negroni and reading, listening to Jack snore down the hall.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0036f-dsc_60001.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0036f-dsc_60001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"424\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>But late this afternoon, June and I took a sunny bike ride around the neighborhood, and somewhere between an impromptu stop at Uncle <a href=\"http:\/\/neversinkcreative.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Sam<\/a>\u2019s house and a quick trip into the grocery store, June started screeching that she couldn\u2019t get into her Tupperware of crackers, so I pulled over, reached into the bike trailer to help her, and that\u2019s when I noticed it: the air smelled exactly like summer in Colorado, like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.genevaglen.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">camp<\/a> I went to for two summers 25 years ago, like dry pine needles in the heat. It\u2019s something we almost never smell here, living as we do in what is essentially a rainforest, where everything is damp and green green green, always. But there it was. My memory of the scent was immediate, below language, just <i>boom, Colorado summer<\/i>. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. A couple of blocks later, blissed out in the grocery store parking lot, I misjudged a turn and fell off my bike into a trash can. But that smell! I\u2019m so glad I found it again.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c3b1d-dsc_61691.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c3b1d-dsc_61691.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"424\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I was going through my hard drive last night and came upon some photos I took on my old digital camera six years ago, the summer that we got Jack, in that janky duplex.
