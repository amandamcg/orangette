In fact, I totally blame Delancey, with all my heart.

It was really something.<\/p>\n<p>Not as great a something, though, as the roasted asparagus with walnut <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">crema<\/span> that I made for dinner a few hours later.

I\u2019ve wanted to go to A16 for a long time now, but somehow, whenever I\u2019m in San Francisco, I wind up so distracted by every option on every street corner that I completely forget what I went there for. I think sensory overstimulation is a requirement for any proper visit to the Bay Area, so I don\u2019t fight it too hard, though it means, sadly, that I have never been to A16. Luckily, the book makes a happy stopgap. It\u2019s visually stunning &#8211; clean but warm, with lots of luminous photographs on sturdy matte paper &#8211; and the recipes walk a fine, perfect line between simple and complex, rustic food and restaurant food. It\u2019s the kind of cookbook I feel inclined to keep on the nightstand, so that I can read it in bed. Just this past weekend, it won Book of the Year in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iacp.com\/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=671\">2009 IACP Cookbook Awards<\/a>, so if you need a really firm, serious endorsement, there you go. It also contains the most inspired asparagus recipe I\u2019ve run across in ages, which is why I\u2019m rattling on and on like this.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/06b94-polaasparagusontable-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5321998321823287106\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/06b94-polaasparagusontable-11.jpg?w=246\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nIt was 70 degrees in Seattle yesterday, unreal for April 6, and I decided to mark the occasion by driving with the windows down and buying some asparagus. The A16 book was lying on the coffee table in the living room, and at some point in the afternoon, I picked it up to put it somewhere else, and when I did, it fell open to page 102, the recipe for Roasted Asparagus with Walnut <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Crema<\/span> and Pecorino Tartufo. I took it as a sign. From Narnia.<\/p>\n<p>The recipe title sounds fancy, and the finished dish tastes fancy, too, but in essence, it\u2019s very straightforward. First, you make the walnut <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">crema<\/span>. You bring some water to a boil, toss in some walnuts, and cook them until they\u2019re tender to the tooth. While this is going on, you sweat some red onion in a skillet. Then you dump both items into the food processor with some of the walnut-blanching water, blend it all up, and then pour in olive oil while you blend it some more. The resulting mixture, now worthy of the handsome word<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> crema<\/span>, looks a little like hummus, but it tastes somehow more like a distant cousin of pesto: fragrant, rich, and deeply savory. You spoon it onto a platter, top it with roasted asparagus, shave some ribbons of pecorino over the whole thing, and splash it with olive oil. The pecorino melts against the hot asparagus, and it\u2019s salty and tangy, and the walnut <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">crema<\/span> sort of slithers beneath it all, subtle but beguiling. We scraped our plates, and then we had it again for lunch today.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Roasted Asparagus with Walnut Crema and Pecorino<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FA16-Food-Wine-Nate-Appleman%2Fdp%2F1580089070%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1239130706%26sr%3D1-1&tag=orangette-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325\"><i>A16: Food + Wine<\/a><\/i><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2009-04-08T05:08:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/997?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>The original version of this recipe calls for Pecorino Tartufo, a sheep\u2019s milk cheese with black truffle, but barring that, any aged pecorino works nicely. I used Pecorino Romano. The original recipe also calls for finishing the dish with some toasted walnuts, but I skipped that part. The walnut crema carried plenty of nut flavor for me, and I thought that anything more was overkill. Maybe I\u2019m weird. Either way, I finished mine with a squeeze of lemon, and it was a nice counterbalance to the richness of the crema.<\/p>\n<p>This recipe is intended to serve six, and even if you don\u2019t need to feed that many, I would go ahead and make the full amount of crema. It will keep in the fridge for a few days, and you can roast the asparagus as needed. (One bunch is perfect for two people.) Also, Brandon has a hunch that leftover crema would make a terrific sauce for pasta, tossed with fresh garlic, lemon, and a little Italian parsley.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n              <h3>For walnut crema:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Kosher salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd cups raw walnuts\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd cup plus 1 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 small red onion, diced (about 1 cup)\r          <\/div>\n                      <h3>For asparagus:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 bunches fat asparagus (about 30 spears, total)\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Extra virgin olive oil\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Kosher salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 block Pecorino Romano or Pecorino Tartufo\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Lemon wedges, optional          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>To make the walnut crema, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the walnuts, and blanch for 8 to 10 minutes, or until tender in the middle. (I pulled mine out after 8 minutes, thinking that they seemed tender enough, but I should have left them for the full 10 minutes. My finished crema was slightly grainy, probably meaning that my walnuts weren\u2019t soft enough.) Drain the walnuts, reserving \u00bc cup of the cooking water. Set aside separately.<\/p>\n<p>In a small skillet, warm 1 Tbsp. olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and a generous pinch of salt, and sweat for about 7 minutes, or until golden brown and softened. Remove from the heat.<\/p>\n<p>In the bowl of a food processor, combine the walnuts, the reserved cooking water, and the onion, and process until creamy. Taste for seasoning: it will probably need a decent amount of salt. With the motor running, slowly add \u00bd cup olive oil, processing until blended. The crema should have the consistency of a creamy hummus. If it seems too thick, add a little water. Taste again for seasoning, and then transfer to a bowl or other container. Cover, and hold at room temperature. (Crema can be stored, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for a few days. Bring to room temperature before serving.)<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 500\u00b0F. Line two baking sheets with aluminum foil.<\/p>\n<p>Snap the tough ends from the asparagus spears. Rinse them, and then dry them well. Spread them in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets. Drizzle them lightly with olive oil, and roll them around, smearing the oil with your hands, to coat evenly. Season with kosher salt. Bake for about 8 minutes, shaking the pan once or twice, until blistered, slightly charred, and tender.<\/p>\n<p>To serve, spoon the crema evenly across the bottom of a platter. Arrange the asparagus spears on top. Working quickly, while the asparagus is still hot, shave Pecorino generously over the platter. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil, and serve immediately, with a squeeze of lemon, if you like.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 6 (first-course) servings<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have to tell you something sort of unpleasant today, but somehow, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be surprised: I have not been doing much cooking lately.
