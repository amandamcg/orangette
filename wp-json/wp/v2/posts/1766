I&#8217;m so sorry, dear reader.]<\/p>\n<p>And at worst, social theory abuses me with page upon page of <strong>impossible, heart-shriveling nonsense<\/strong>, such as the following (courtesy of a misguided soul named Timothy W.

Spray two baking sheets with cooking spray, or line them with silicone baking mats, if you have them.<\/p>\n<p>In a large bowl, beat together butter and sugars with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add vanilla, and beat to incorporate. Add egg, beating to combine well. In a separate bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon, and then add these dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing at low speed until just combined. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the oats, apricots, and pistachios.<\/p>\n<p>Spoon rounded tablespoons of dough (I used a small ice-cream scoop) about two inches apart onto the baking sheets. Bake cookies, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, until golden brown, about 15 to 18 minutes. Transfer cookies carefully with a spatula onto racks. The cookies will crisp as they cool.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: About 18 cookies<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s that time again. Behold a reprise of geekiness.
