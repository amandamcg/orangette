I\u2019ve been keeping it from you all this time.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/12705-dpp_0011-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/12705-dpp_0011-21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Of course, good oatmeal, like Megan\u2019s oatmeal in the link up there, reheats so well that there\u2019s no reason not to eat it on the second day. By all means, eat your leftover oatmeal. \u00a0But should you ever find yourself with not-as-good-as-Megan\u2019s oatmeal, or should you be bored with eating oatmeal as oatmeal, or should you be only human in that you would rather have a muffin (which some people like to remind us, <i>wanh wanh WAAAH<\/i>,\u00a0is basically cake) than hot cereal, you should laminate this recipe and stick it to the fridge. I first heard about it from <a href=\"http:\/\/coffeeinthewoodshed.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Lisa<\/a>, who (I think) heard about it from\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.soulemama.com\/soulemama\/2012\/03\/in-my-kitchen.html\" target=\"_blank\">Amanda Soule<\/a>, who quietly slipped her recipe into the end of a blog post a couple of years ago. And now I am here to shout about it.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve made these muffins many times, many different ways. \u00a0At some point, I discovered that there\u2019s also a recipe for leftover oatmeal muffins in <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Fannie-Farmer-Cookbook-Marion-Cunningham\/dp\/0553568817\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=fannie%20farmer%20cookbook&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1391112322&amp;sr=8-2&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">The Fannie Farmer Cookbook<\/a><\/i>, and the way I make mine is a hybrid of that one and Amanda\u2019s. \u00a0I use more butter than Amanda does &#8211; though there\u2019s still not much; you could certainly try more &#8211; and I use less baking powder. \u00a0As muffins go, these are not sweet, not heavy, and they\u2019re also not especially cake-like. They\u2019re just cake-like enough to push the right buttons, but not to set off any alarms. \u00a0They have a wonderful chew, the way most baked goods involving oats do, and if you use steel-cut oatmeal, it\u2019s especially nice. The steel-cut oats almost seem to crackle &#8211; don\u2019t know how that could be, but they do &#8211; in your mouth. And it\u2019s a handy recipe, too, because in addition to taking care of your leftover oatmeal, it will also absorb any flavorings you want to add: nuts (ding ding!), seeds, dried fruit, fresh fruit, chunks of chocolate (ding ding!), spices, whatnot. I call this recipe a keeper.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing I should say: because these muffins don\u2019t have a great abundance of butter, they really are best on the first day. \u00a0I know a lot of recipes say that, and I don\u2019t always agree, but here I do. \u00a0That said, the recipe does make a good number of muffins, and if you have some left over, all is not lost. I\u2019ve eaten them after two or three days on the counter, and not unhappily. \u00a0Just throw them in a toaster oven (or regular oven) to warm them and recrisp the edges.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Leftover Oatmeal Muffins<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.soulemama.com\/soulemama\/2012\/03\/in-my-kitchen.html\" target=\"_blank\">Amanda Soule<\/a> and <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Fannie-Farmer-Cookbook-Marion-Cunningham\/dp\/0553568817\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=fannie%20farmer%20cookbook&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1391112322&amp;sr=8-2&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">The Fannie Farmer Cookbook<\/a><\/i><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2014-01-31T18:53:00-05:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/215?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>These muffins come together quickly, especially if you mix up the dry ingredients the night before.
