I\u2019m like a horse with blinders, only less obedient.  All I can say is this: watch out. It\u2019s best to keep your distance unless you\u2019re prepared to discuss the following topics:<\/p>\n<p>a) veils [I decided last Wednesday not to wear mine, and I feel so rebellious and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">free<\/span><span>!<\/span>],<br \/>b) party favors [ours are recipe cards for some of our favorite dishes, bundled with brown ribbon],<br \/>c) rented tables and chairs and linens [how does anyone keep track of all this crap?], and<br \/>d) the pesky Final Head Count, which eludes me still.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Oh, friends<\/span>.  I\u2019m a total bore.  I used to scoff at stories of wild-eyed brides, running amok with checklists and fabric samples, but now I think I get it.  It\u2019s sort of embarrassing to admit, but I know how they feel.  Even though I like to think of our wedding as less of a production and more of a big <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">party<\/span>, it\u2019s still, you know, a lot of work.  It just is.  It\u2019s work for a good cause, but still, it\u2019s work.  The kind of work that involves such things as 39 yards of grosgrain ribbon.  The kind of work that ties knots in your shoulders.  The kind of work that gets you thirsty.  Like, lemonade-thirsty.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/45e83-basillemonade014-31.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/45e83-basillemonade014-31.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5085610698545449234\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>When I was a kid, I had a special thing for lemonade.  If I was lucky, my mother would buy a tub of Country Time\u00ae pink lemonade mix, the kind that came in a little cardboard cylinder that was supposed to look like a wooden barrel.  I\u2019d load up my glass until it was hot pink, sugared to the brim, sweet enough to make my throat burn.  It was <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">heaven<\/span>.  But it didn\u2019t happen very often. More likely, I was on my own with lemon juice, sugar, and water.  This being the mid-80s, however, our lemon juice came from a squeeze bottle, and our sugar was Equal\u00ae.  I devised a standard formula.  Into one hi-ball glass I would squeeze ten squirts of bottled lemon, three packets of sweetener, and water to fill.  It was exquisite &#8211; a garish yellow, wildly sour, wildly sweet, the type of thing that, I\u2019m quite certain, removes tooth enamel on contact.  Luckily for all of us, I have since learned a better way to get my lemonade fix &#8211; sans dentists, sans mix.<\/p>\n<p>The recipe in question comes from this month\u2019s <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Gourmet<\/span>, and with only a few minor tweaks. It starts with a simple syrup &#8211; water and sugar, boiled briefly to dissolve &#8211; infused with strips of lemon zest. Into that goes the kicker, a whack of fresh basil, and then it\u2019s left to steep. Then you strain the syrup and mix it with doses of fresh lemon, cold water, and ice cubes. It may not be instant, per se, but once the syrup is made, it\u2019s lickety-split to assemble whenever the mood strikes. (Which, if you\u2019re me, is every day, around lunchtime.) It\u2019s the lemonade we all know and love, only more sophisticated, with a sweet, herbal whiff of basil. I worried that it might be too fussy or fiddly, a good thing pushed too far, but I needn\u2019t have: it\u2019s still lemonade, only a little smarter<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">.<\/span> It\u2019s lemonade with, say, a college degree. It\u2019s just the stuff for a summer afternoon &#8211; preferably, if I may say so, alongside a salad of tomatoes, mozzarella, and fresh basil.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/22daa-basillemonade028-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/22daa-basillemonade028-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5085455117650118914\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And not to, you know, uh, bring it back (<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">choo-choo<\/span>!) to the wedding, but it\u2019s just the stuff for that, too. Our caterers will be pouring two types of infused lemonade: a raspberry version for the rehearsal dinner, and a rosemary one for the reception.  And thank goodness, since at this rate, my own supply will be long gone.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Basil Lemonade<\/span><br \/>Adapted from <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Gourmet<\/span>, July 2007<\/p>\n<p>I used tap water in both stages of the recipe below, but that\u2019s only because ours tastes pretty decent.  If you don\u2019t like the flavor of your tap water, use spring water instead.<\/p>\n<p>2 cups Basil Lemon Syrup (see below)<br \/>2 cups cold water<br \/>2 cups ice cubes<br \/>1 \u00bc cups fresh lemon juice<\/p>\n<p>Stir together all ingredients in a large pitcher; then pour into tall glasses half-filled with ice.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: about 6 cups<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Basil Lemon Syrup<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I love the combination of basil and lemon, but you could also make a tasty syrup with mint, or rosemary.  If you use mint, you could probably use the same amount, or maybe a bit less.  If you use rosemary, I imagine you\u2019d need much less \u2013 maybe only one medium-size sprig for an entire batch of syrup.  If you used any more than that, it might taste too piney.<\/p>\n<p>Or, hey, if you want to take things in a different direction, you might try tossing in a fistful of fresh raspberries, instead of an herb.  I haven\u2019t yet tried it, nor do I know exactly how our caterers make <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">their<\/span> raspberry lemonade, but what\u2019s the worst that could happen?  Really.<\/p>\n<p>Also, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Gourmet<\/span> says that you could combine some of the syrup with vodka and fresh lemon juice to make a summery gimlet.  That would be for those days, of course, when lemonade just doesn\u2019t cut it.<\/p>\n<p>2 cups water<br \/>1 cup granulated sugar<br \/>4 (4- by 1-inch) strips lemon zest<br \/>2 cups packed fresh basil sprigs<\/p>\n<p>In a medium saucepan, combine the water, sugar, and zest.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.  Remove from the heat, add the basil, stir to combine, and let stand at room temperature, covered, for 1 hour.  Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and chill until cold, about 1 hour.  Strain the syrup through a sieve into an airtight container, pressing hard on and then discarding the solids.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Note<\/span>: The syrup will keep, covered and chilled, for up to five days.  The recipe can also be easily doubled.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: about 2 \u00bd cups<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve got to tell you something, guys.
