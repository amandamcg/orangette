It\u2019s almost Thursday, but if you act fast, you can still have a Week to Remember:<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 1<\/b>: On your day off, clean the apartment you just moved out of. Don\u2019t forget to grab that last load of laundry from the dryer, the way I almost did.

Feel both triumphant and defeated. Take a shower. Apply a bathrobe. Drink two glasses of cheap prosecco with Campari and a squeeze of orange. Now: try to make it to the dinner table without falling down. Not because of the prosecco, but because you put Pledge on the dining room table the other day, and when you did, there was apparently a substantial amount of fallout, leaving the floor with the traction properties of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Black_ice\">black ice<\/a>. Feel your way along the wall until you reach the bedroom. Sleep.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 3<\/b>: Unpack boxes. While you do so, have an idea: you can remove those cobwebs from the ceiling by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swiffer.com\/en_US\/sweeper.do\">Swiffer<\/a>ing it! Begin immediately. Stop after three minutes, put away the Swiffer, get a chair to stand on, and begin removing cottony Swiffer bits from your ceiling. Unpack more boxes.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 4<\/b>: Repeat the unpacking boxes part of Step 3. Continue for two days &#8211; or more, as needed.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 5<\/b>: Avoid unpacking, Swiffering, Pledging, or doing anything else you are supposed to be doing. Stare into the middle distance. Steam an artichoke and eat it with an unconscionable amount of mayonnaise. Come to around three in the afternoon, and notice that life has provided you with a large north-facing window and yet another cloudy Seattle afternoon &#8211; in other words, your favorite situation for picture-taking. Get out some radishes, and have your way with them.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d7b3c-5596826869_d3af115206_b1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5592719217825544866\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d7b3c-5596826869_d3af115206_b1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"788\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nAnd when you\u2019ve gotten that out of your system, make Molly Stevens\u2019s butter-glazed radishes for dinner. And roast a chicken to go with it, if you have one. (I didn\u2019t, but I would have, if I did.) And there\u2019s your Week to Remember, especially if you skip Steps 1 through 4.<\/p>\n<p>This radish recipe comes from the book <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAll-About-Braising-Uncomplicated-Cooking%2Fdp%2F0393052303%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1301891432%26sr%3D8-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">All About Braising<\/a><\/i>, which I love. I\u2019ve written about it at least a couple of times, if not a few. I\u2019ve had this particular recipe bookmarked since the first time I flipped through the book, years ago now. Until I saw it, I had never thought to eat radishes cooked &#8211; and to be honest, I couldn\u2019t really imagine it, since they feel so right in their raw state, so peppery and crisp. But Molly Stevens has never led me astray, and I don\u2019t see how the union of butter and radishes could ever be bad, so when the first spring radishes started cropping up at the market, I decided it was time to give it a try.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/06316-5596830315_ef7651e684_b1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5592719223256154866\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/06316-5596830315_ef7651e684_b1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"784\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nAs braises go, this one is very quick. You\u2019re not dealing with short ribs or brisket here. The radishes spend almost as much time soaking in a bowl of water beforehand &#8211; to loosen any trapped dirt &#8211; as they do cooking. They get only a brief simmer in butter and stock, and then you reduce the liquid to a glaze that coats them. You can use any kind or color of radish you want, but if you use red ones, there\u2019s a nice side effect: they give some of their color to the cooking liquid, which goes rosy, and they themselves wind up the color of cotton candy. Very handsome, dignified cotton candy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/56861-5597409324_247c60bb3f_b1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5592719227561065522\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/56861-5597409324_247c60bb3f_b1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"789\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nAt first bite, I wasn\u2019t entirely sold. The flavor of cooked radishes doesn\u2019t announce itself with trumpets and cannons. It\u2019s sweet, almost, and very delicate. It\u2019s quiet. It sort of reminded me of a Sunday lunch I had to go to once with my parents, as a kid. We were at the home of some family friends, and they made <i>blanquette de veau<\/i>. It was supposed to be very chic and fancy, but I\u2019d never eaten anything like it, and to me, it looked and tasted approximately like paste. I remember leaning on my mother\u2019s shoulder, whispering in her ear, moaning about the \u201c<i>old-people food<\/i>.\u201d Of course, that\u2019s not fair &#8211; to the veal <i>or<\/i> the radishes. But the first impressions were similar. It\u2019s not that cooked radishes are old-people food, but on first taste, you <i>could<\/i> mistake them for bland. But! If you hang out a little longer, if you taste a second one and a third, you\u2019ll find a lot of flavor there, low and earthy and resonant. It\u2019ll surprise you. The butter is there, too, giving them some heft, and then there\u2019s the texture, creamy and dense, like well-cooked cauliflower. Does that sound off-putting? I like well-cooked cauliflower. Maybe think in the direction of a potato instead? A particularly light, smooth-textured potato? Only more interesting, because it\u2019s a radish. A <i>butter-glazed radish<\/i>. Happy spring, finally.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Butter-Glazed Radishes<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAll-About-Braising-Uncomplicated-Cooking%2Fdp%2F0393052303%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1301891432%26sr%3D8-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">All About Braising<\/a><\/i>, by Molly Stevens<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2011-04-07T05:33:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/605?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>I think these radishes would make an ideal side dish for roasted chicken, but you could serve them with almost anything: fish, pork, probably even a fried egg.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 lb. small radishes (2 to 2 \u00bd dozen)\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 Tbsp. unsalted butter\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1\/3 cup chicken stock, or water\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Large pinch of sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Coarse salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Freshly ground black pepper          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Trim the roots from the radishes, and pare off the greens, leaving \u00bc to \u00bd inch of the stems. (This is mostly for looks, and for the slight flavor the stems bring, but if you want, you can completely trim away the greens.) Soak the radishes in cold water for about 15 minutes to loosen any dirt trapped in the stems. Drain and scrub the radishes. If any are more than 1 inch in diameter, halve them.<\/p>\n<p>Put the radishes in a medium (10-inch) skillet. The skillet should hold them in a single layer. Add the butter, stock or water, sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; then cover, reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, and cook until the radishes are tender, 18 to 25 minutes. You should be able to easily pierce them with a small knife.<\/p>\n<p>Remove the lid, shake the pan to roll the radishes around, and continue to simmer until the liquid reduces to a glaze and coats the radishes, another 5 to 10 minutes. (You may need to increase the heat under the pan.) Taste for seasoning.
