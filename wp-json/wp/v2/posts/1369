I don\u2019t know how the heck that happened.  I had a dream last night that the ocean was in our backyard, and that I was standing at the window, looking out at it.  Above the water, the sky was overcast, thick with clouds.  As I stood there watching, all of a sudden, one of the clouds shook loose and fell, just like that, dropping fast and heavy, straight out of the sky.  It landed in the water with a huge, gorgeous splash, like <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Paul_Bunyan\">Paul Bunyan<\/a> doing a cannonball in the neighborhood swimming pool, like some exotic flower breaking into bloom.  This year, Thanksgiving feels a little like that, I think.  Like it fell out of the sky.  It\u2019s sudden, huge, gorgeous.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e1824-oklahoma144-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e1824-oklahoma144-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5134613682705839186\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow we fly to Oklahoma, and I can\u2019t wait.  I had wanted to give you a new recipe today, something fitting to the occasion, but here we are, and uh, I don\u2019t have one.   I do, however, have a manuscript that\u2019s really coming along, and it has lots of recipes, and in only three weeks, it will be done.  I hope that counts for something.  To me, it feels like everything.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/6b98e-sunday279-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/6b98e-sunday279-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5134613691295773810\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So I hope you\u2019ll understand if I\u2019m a little quieter than usual right now.  You don\u2019t need me, anyway.  You\u2019ve got lots of cooking and baking and eating to do. There are birds to be roasted and dishes to be filled.
