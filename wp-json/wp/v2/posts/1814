After all, I learned from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/\"><em>New York Times<\/em><\/a> (\u201cLive from Miami, a Style Showdown,\u201d September 26, 2004) that John Kerry has a \u201cbuoyantly vertical hairstyle,\u201d and now I have to see what it can do for him. According to Caroline F. Keating, and professor of psychology at Colgate University, \u201c<strong>He has exciting hair, which is . . . quite useful<\/strong>.\u201d Let\u2019s hope so. I don&#8217;t take this as lightly as it may seem.<\/p>\n<p>3. I love riding home from work on the bus. I strategically choose my seat so that I\u2019ll be on the sunny side as we head north from downtown, and then I relish <strong>the half-hearted battle with sleep<\/strong> that inevitably ensues. I adore sleeping in moving vehicles\u2014only when someone else is doing the driving, of course.<\/p>\n<p>When I was younger and used to ride horses competitively, I spent many late nights sleeping in the front seat of my riding trainer\u2019s pickup truck as we sped across New Mexico or Colorado to a show. Jenny, my trainer, hated <strong>the eerie way my head would flop down<\/strong> over my chest; she always wanted to grab my hair and yank me up, make sure I was still breathing. I was indeed, just very relaxed. Years later, I had the misfortune of doing the floppy-head move in the Paris M\u00e9tro on my way home from school, and I drooled all over the collar of <strong>the long and dramatic black wool coat <\/strong>I\u2019d saved up to buy for myself. I was very careful to avoid making eye contact with anyone when I woke up startled and began madly wiping at the wet spot on my cheek. I do love to sleep in moving vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>4.
