I think it would be fair to say that your comments on <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2011\/08\/how-we-do-what-we-do.html\" target=\"_blank\">my last post<\/a> made me very, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">very<\/span> happy. It feels much less lonely in here, and I have you to thank for that. More than anything, I just love that we can talk about this kind of stuff. When I first started writing here, more than seven(!) years ago now, I had no idea where this weird blog thing of mine would go. It still surprises me. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, and I\u2019m glad I am, too.<\/p>\n<p>It also surprises me how many totally so-so recipes I tried last week. Absolutely nothing worth telling you about. So-so chicken, so-so apricots, so-so beans. And then, while I was trying to decide what to do about that, I tumbled down a rabbit hole of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4OZ9F3NTvzY\" target=\"_blank\">Stevie<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bwdDVZsz2es&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\">Nicks<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xuPCUMoDc6M&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\">videos<\/a>, which has nothing to do with so-so recipes, aside from the fact that it too gave me nothing worth telling you about. (Though my hair does look remarkably like hers when I wake up in the morning!) And then I noticed that the blackberries I picked up at last Friday\u2019s market were still hanging out in the fridge, so I pulled out an old recipe for oat scones, and here we are.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/02cee-sconesabovecrop-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5640870986358877922\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/02cee-sconesabovecrop-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1130\" height=\"867\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I first tasted these scones at the Standard Baking Company in Portland, Maine. I was traveling with my mother, and though I ate the scone about midway through the trip, I thought about it the whole way home. This was back when I was writing a column for <i>Bon App\u00e9tit<\/i>, and I called up my editor and told her about it. She seemed interested, so I called the bakery and asked if they might share the recipe. (This was the best part of writing that column: having a legitimate, very official-sounding reason to call up strangers and ask for recipes.) The story ran in the summer of 2009. The bakery\u2019s original version uses blueberries &#8211; wild Maine blueberries, if you happen to have any of those lying around &#8211; and the combination of oats and blueberries is hard to beat. But this past week, I discovered that I might like these scones even better with blackberries. Who knows I\u2019ll discover next. Raspberries? Raisins?! GOLDEN raisins?! Are you still with me?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/cb1e8-sconescrop1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5640871134949505650\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/cb1e8-sconescrop1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1127\" height=\"869\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve posted a number of scone recipes over the years, and yes, I am a sick, sick person, because I have another one for you. But these are in a different category. Ordinarily, I like scones in their traditional Scottish form: sturdy, dense, pleasantly dry. That is not what these scones are like. They\u2019re more cakey than that, more tender, almost crossing into biscuit territory. In fact, if the bakery didn\u2019t call them a scone, I might be inclined to call them drop biscuits. As breakfast pastries go, they\u2019re not at all sweet, and I like that. The flavor of the oats sits right out front, followed closely by butter, and then, every other bite or so, you hit a pocket of soft blackberry. It\u2019s the scone\u2019s own built-in supply of jam.<\/p>\n<p>Like a classic biscuit dough, this scone dough needs a light touch. It\u2019s important to work quickly, and to not overwork it. There will be small bits and flakes of cold butter in the dough, and they\u2019re essential to its structure: if they get too warm or overworked, you can wind up with a scone that spreads like a cookie or a pancake. Also, Brandon wants me to be sure to tell you that these scones are particularly good toasted. If you have a toaster oven, that\u2019s ideal. Put the scone in there whole, and let it go until it\u2019s crisp on the outside and the smudge of blackberry across the top starts to caramelize. We\u2019ve eaten ours that way for the past five mornings, and I think the flavor actually improves with some age. In any case, <i>boom<\/i>! Instant breakfast. You and your Stevie hair are set.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Oat Scones<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forestreet.biz\/en\/Other-Restaurants\">Standard Baking Company<\/a> (Portland, ME)<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2011-08-14T23:45:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/544?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>If you use frozen berries, do not thaw them before using.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 cups all-purpose flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1\/3 cup packed golden brown sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. baking powder\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd tsp. baking soda\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00be tsp. kosher salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            11 Tbsp.

Add the flour mixture and the rolled oats, and stir until just combined. The dough will be thick and sticky. Add the berries, and stir briefly to mix. [When I use blackberries in particular, I find that it\u2019s difficult to stir them into the dough without crushing them, overworking the dough, and turning the whole mixture purple. My solution is to only stir a little, and then move on to the next step. As you scoop the dough onto the baking sheets, you can use your fingers to press any errant berries into the mounds of dough.]<\/p>\n<p>Using a 1\/3-cup measuring cup, scoop the dough into mounds, arranging them 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Garnish the tops with rolled oats and Turbinado sugar.<\/p>\n<p>Bake for 24 to 27 minutes, or until the center of the scones feels firm to the touch.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note<\/em>: Wrapped in plastic wrap or stored in an airtight container, these keep beautifully at room temperature for 4 or 5 days.
