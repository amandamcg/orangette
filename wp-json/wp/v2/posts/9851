And because it feels like time is on my side (yes it is, la la la, though probably just for tonight), I wanted to pop in the door and say a small something. Hello.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t feel very\u00a0interested in writing about food. It has felt\u00a0jarring and incongruous to write about food and cooking these past months, like I&#8217;d be doing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YWyCCJ6B2WE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">that old\u00a0Wizard of Oz number<\/a>, pulling levers and pushing buttons, yelling <em>Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!<\/em>\u00a0even though\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.seattlemet.com\/articles\/2017\/4\/18\/molly-wizenberg-is-an-open-book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">everyone\u00a0can see what&#8217;s going on back here<\/a>.\u00a0But I am of course still cooking, because I like to cook. And I can tell you that I&#8217;m about to make another loaf of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2016\/07\/out-here-up-here\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nigel Slater&#8217;s Banana Bread with Muscovado and Chocolate<\/a>, my second in the past month. I can also tell you that\u00a0I got a copy of Melissa Clark&#8217;s new showstopper\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2quadXk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Dinner<\/em><\/a>, and I&#8217;ve Post-It-flagged approximately 50% of the recipes. I&#8217;ve made the Harissa Chicken with Leeks, Potatoes, and Yogurt twice now, and I might make it a third time before I tear myself away to make something else. It&#8217;s perfect. I will write about it, if you really want me to, but what I really think you should do is order the entire cookbook. I bought a copy for my partner\u00a0yesterday,\u00a0and it is her FIRST cookbook, and if ever there were a cookbook to give someone as their VERY FIRST cookbook, <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2quadXk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Dinner<\/em><\/a> is worthy. It is also worthy, I should note, of being one&#8217;s 1000th cookbook. Melissa Clark is a living legend.<\/p>\n<p>Also notable: I finally got around to making my friend Jess Fechtor&#8217;s Buttermilk Biscuits, from her book\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2plOwL5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Stir<\/em><\/a>, and I will now be making them forever. June was so excited about Jess&#8217;s biscuits that when they came out of the oven, she leaned in close to the cooling rack, hoping for a sniff,\u00a0and burned her chin on the rim of the sheet pan. It was sad, but she recovered sufficiently to eat two biscuits. I served them alongside our friend Kathy Gunst&#8217;s Roasted Fall-Vegetable Soup, from her book <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2pNofqz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Soup Swap<\/em><\/a>, and I will now be making that forever, too.<\/p>\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t feel entirely right to write about food, as I said, even though I just spent a couple of\u00a0paragraphs on it. What I would rather do is share with you some things that I&#8217;ve been reading. I&#8217;ve been reading a lot in recent months, maybe because I&#8217;m also in a period of learning a lot, or maybe I&#8217;m learning a lot because I&#8217;m reading, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve been accumulating a list of stories and articles that I didn&#8217;t want to lose track of.

It&#8217;s set on a college campus in the mid-nineties, and it has a whip-smart female protagonist, and it&#8217;s crammed full of references to &#8217;90s bands and albums.
