Then again, he\u2019s over at the restaurant space right now, drinking a beer and eating Cool(!) Ranch(!) Doritos(!) while he rips out the carpet, so it\u2019s really only fair that I should have a snack here too.  Like peppermint bark.  Which is, for the record, very refreshing.  And inspiring!  Look at that.  I just wrote a whole paragraph.<\/p>\n<p>I was introduced to this particular peppermint bark by my sister Lisa, who always, always, finds the best recipes.   For a few years now &#8211; or maybe even several; I can\u2019t remember &#8211; she has made it for the holidays.  She gives most of it away to friends, but she usually sets aside a tin for the family to eat during Christmas, when we\u2019re all together.   Last year, when we spent Christmas Eve at her house on Long Island, I\u2019m pretty sure I ate more peppermint bark than dinner.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ce6be-polapeppermintbark2-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ce6be-polapeppermintbark2-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5280223624982852898\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Lisa and I were on the phone the other day, having a marathon catch-up session, and while we talked, I made a batch of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/12\/building-blocks.html\">chocolate blocks<\/a>.  I happened to mention that I was working on my holiday gift-making, and Lisa confided that she was running behind on hers.  She usually makes both peppermint bark and bittersweet almond bark, handing out small sachets of each, but this year, she told me, so many people have asked for the peppermint bark that she is thinking of skipping the almond one entirely. I was sad to hear that &#8211; last Christmas Eve, I also ate more almond bark than dinner &#8211; but I understand.  That peppermint bark is special.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/a68ac-polapeppermintbark1-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/a68ac-polapeppermintbark1-11.jpg?w=249\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5280195867611172306\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Before I tasted Lisa\u2019s version, the words <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">peppermint bark<\/span> weren\u2019t even in my vocabulary.  I guess I thought of it as one of those cutesy things you get in a gift basket but never eat, like tiny jars of cheese spread or plastic-encased summer sausages.  Most of the time, it was simply a sheet of pallid white chocolate with crushed-up peppermint candies mixed in &#8211; or, in a slightly fancier incarnation, a layer of dark chocolate topped with a layer of white chocolate with crushed-up peppermint candies mixed in.  I know this will sound like sacrilege to some, but I couldn\u2019t get excited about it.<\/p>\n<p>But then, THEN, there was Lisa\u2019s version, which is really <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Bon App\u00e9tit<\/span>\u2019s version, a recipe that ran in the magazine ten whole years ago, in 1998.  It consists of not one layer, not two layers, but <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">three<\/span> layers.  The top and bottom are white chocolate, onto which you sprinkle crushed peppermints, and the middle layer is a bittersweet ganache, ever so slightly soft and truffle-like, spiked with peppermint extract.  It\u2019s pretty, for one thing, but it\u2019s also unusually delicious: heady with mint, only moderately sweet, and surprisingly sophisticated, crunchy in parts and smooth in others, like a proper chocolate confection.  It\u2019s Americana, yes, but Americana in a vintage designer dress.  If the <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/12\/for-that-very-reason.html\">butter cookies<\/a> I made last week bore a faint resemblance to my grandmother, this peppermint bark is my fantasy great-aunt: the one who lives in San Francisco, wears Jackie O. dresses and glasses with vermilion frames, makes hot chocolate from scratch, and always knows what\u2019s showing at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sfmoma.org\/\">SFMOMA<\/a>.  What a lady she would be.  I wish she actually existed.  At least I have peppermint bark.<\/p>\n<p>This recipe takes a bit more time than the average bark specimen, what with the layering of chocolates and the required chilling in between, but it\u2019s worth the effort.  Once you have your ingredients ready, it\u2019s really very easy: you just chop, melt, smear, and repeat.  And while it cools, you can do any number of important things, like washing dishes, or chiding your husband for eating Cool Ranch Doritos without you, or calling your sister to thank her for her brilliance.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Three-Layer Peppermint Bark<\/span><br \/>Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/Layered-Peppermint-Crunch-Bark-5739\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Bon App\u00e9tit<\/span>, December 1998<\/a><\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re shopping for white chocolate, make sure that the words \u201ccocoa butter\u201d appear in the list of ingredients.  When I went to buy mine, I was shocked by how many brands contain absolutely <span>no<\/span> cocoa butter.  (Instead, you get only sugar, hydrogenated oil, artificial flavorings, and the like.)  I wound up using Callebaut, which isn\u2019t cheap, but it was a worthy splurge.<\/p>\n<p>Also, to crush the peppermints coarsely, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Bon App\u00e9tit<\/span> advises tapping the wrapped candies firmly with the bottom edge of an unopened 15- to 16-ounce can.  I used a heavy glass jar, and that worked fine too.<\/p>\n<p>17 oz. white chocolate, such as Callebaut, finely chopped<br \/>30 red-and-white-striped hard peppermint candies, coarsely crushed<br \/>7 oz. bittersweet chocolate, such as Ghirardelli 60%, finely chopped<br \/>6 Tbsp. heavy cream<br \/>\u00be tsp. peppermint extract<\/p>\n<p>Turn a large baking sheet upside down, and cover it securely with aluminum foil.  Measure out and mark a 9- by 12-inch rectangle on the foil.<\/p>\n<p>Put the white chocolate in a metal (or other heatproof) bowl, and set it over a saucepan of barely simmering water.  (Do not allow the bottom of the bowl to touch the water.) Stir occasionally until the chocolate is melted and smooth; if you take its temperature with a candy thermometer, it should register 110\u00b0F.  Remove the chocolate from the heat.  Pour 2\/3 cup of it onto the rectangle on the foil.  Using an icing spatula, spread the chocolate to fill the rectangle.  Sprinkle with \u00bc cup of the crushed peppermints.  Chill until set, about 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, combine the bittersweet chocolate, cream, and peppermint extract in a heavy medium saucepan.  Warm over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture is just melted and smooth.  Cool to barely lukewarm, about 5 minutes.  Then remove the baking sheet from the refrigerator, and pour the bittersweet chocolate mixture over the white chocolate rectangle.  Using an icing spatula \u2013 make sure you cleaned it after using it for the white chocolate, above! \u2013 spread the bittersweet chocolate in an even layer.  Chill until very cold and firm, about 25 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Rewarm the remaining white chocolate over barely simmering water to 110\u00b0F. Working quickly, pour the white chocolate over the firm bittersweet layer, using your (again, clean) icing spatula to spread it to cover.  Sprinkle with remaining crushed peppermints.  Chill just until firm, about 20 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Carefully lift the foil from the baking sheet onto a large cutting board.  Trim away any ragged edges of the rectangle.  (These are yours to nibble at, a little prize for your efforts.)  Cut the bark crosswise into 2-inch-wide strips.  Using metal spatula, slip the bark off of the foil and onto the cutting board.  Cut each strip crosswise into 3 sections, and then cut each section diagonally into 2 triangles.  Or, alternatively, just cut each strip into smaller pieces of whatever size you like.  That\u2019s what I did.<\/p>\n<p>Pack into an airtight container, with sheets of wax paper between layers of bark to prevent them from sticking to one another.  Store in the refrigerator.  Serve cold or, to emphasize the slight softness of the bittersweet layer, let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Note<\/span>: This bark will keep for up to 2 weeks, if not more.  If you plan to pack it in a tin or baggie with other holiday sweets, be sure to wrap it separately in plastic wrap.  Or maybe wax paper and then plastic wrap, so that it doesn\u2019t sweat.  If you left it naked, so to speak, to mix and mingle with other cookies or candies, everything might wind up tasting and smelling like peppermint.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: about 36 pieces, or more, if you cut them smaller<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve been sitting here for the past twenty minutes, trying to figure out how to start this post.
