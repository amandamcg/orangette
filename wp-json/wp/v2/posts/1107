Which, conveniently, is also the most ridiculously easy apple tart I have ever made.  Isn\u2019t it charming?  In a rustic, \u201coh, this old thing?\u201d sort of way?  It\u2019s the edible equivalent of a dog-eared book: a little rough around the edges, rumpled here and there, but 100 percent lovable on the inside.  It\u2019s the kind of dessert that wants to be eaten in a red barn with a loft full of hay bales, or in a bed with flannel sheets, while the wind whistles outside.  Unfortunately, I have neither a barn nor any flannel, but I\u2019m working on it.<\/p>\n<p>I came to this recipe in a roundabout way.  Namely, via a desire to learn to cook to rabbit.  I don\u2019t quite know where I got the idea, but a few weeks ago, it took hold of me. Rabbit is not exactly a popular meat choice, I know, but I had eaten it once before, in a restaurant, and though I had to struggle to keep my thoughts from drifting toward Beatrix Potter, Peter Rabbit, and Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, it was very, very delicious. I had been wanting to try it at home, but I was a little afraid.  I needed a partner in crime, or in whatever sort of deviant activity rabbit cookery constitutes. I happened to mention this to my friend Carla, and much to my delight, her eyes lit up immediately.  The wheels were officially in motion!   Then, not long after,  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPlatter-Figs-Other-Recipes%2Fdp%2F1579653464&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">this beauty<\/a> happened to glue itself to my hands at the bookstore &#8211; books can be so <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">needy<\/span>, especially the pretty ones &#8211; and lo and behold, it offered an entire menu built around roasted rabbit. Clearly, it was fate.  The menu began with a spinach cake, a savory sort of custard-meets-frittata, and then moved on to rabbit rubbed with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and mustard, parsnips roasted in olive oil, and, finally, a free-form apple tart.  Hubba hubba.<\/p>\n<p>So last Wednesday night, we gathered around Carla\u2019s stove and put it all together, and it certainly looked promising.  I was planning, actually, to tell you today about the spinach cake recipe, or maybe even the rabbit. But to be perfectly honest, neither turned out particularly well.  The rabbit was just okay &#8211; a little dry, and with strangely curdled pan juices.  I hate to admit this, but we gave most of the leftover meat to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/sets\/72157606225919775\/\">Jack<\/a>.  He was the only one who really liked it.  And the spinach cake, too, wasn\u2019t quite right.  It was oddly watery, and I could hardly muster half a slice. The parsnips, however, were delicious.  You can never go wrong with high heat, olive oil, and root vegetables.  But the apple tart, the afterthought of the evening, wound up stealing the entire show.  In fact, Carla\u2019s son Lluc proclaimed it the best tart he\u2019s ever had.  He ought to know, too: he doesn\u2019t like cake, but he loves tarts and pies, so he\u2019s eaten plenty of them.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, it\u2019s all just as well, right? In a contest between spinach cake, roasted rabbit, and apple tart, I think we all know who the winner would be.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/b1efe-polaappletartabove1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/b1efe-polaappletartabove1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5259620476341661698\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>I like my fruit tarts simple, <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/07\/important-parts.html\">as you know<\/a>, and this one is just that. You begin by rolling a batch of buttery dough into a large rectangle.  (I used my usual recipe, not the one Tanis proposes; I am becoming <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">such<\/span> a rebel.)   It doesn\u2019t matter if the rectangle is a little irregular.  In fact, it probably will be.  That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.  It\u2019s <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">rustic<\/span>, bless it, and that word excuses all flaws. Anyway, yes, so you roll it out, and then you slide it onto a rimmed baking sheet. Then you peel some apples and slice them thinly. Don\u2019t throw out the cores, though.  Instead, chuck them into a saucepan, add some sugar and water, and boil the mixture down until to a thick syrup: later, once strained, this is going to be your glaze. (Smart, isn\u2019t it?  It\u2019s reason enough, really, to love David Tanis, notwithstanding our disappointment with the iffy rabbit and wonky spinach cake.) You fan the sliced apples atop the dough like cards in a game of Solitaire, and then you dust them with sugar.  Then you bake the tart until the crust is golden brown, at which point the apples should be tender and fragrant.  Let it cool a little bit, brush it with warm glaze, and that\u2019s it.   Dessert is done: a little sweet, a little tart, perfectly understated, buttery to just the right degree.  We served it that night with honey-sweetened whipped cream, which I strongly suggest.  I might also suggest, while we\u2019re at it, that you play a game of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.daysofwonder.com\/tickettoride\/en\/\">Ticket to Ride<\/a> afterward.  Do not, however, play against our friend Sam, because he will beat you every time.  He will be nice about it, but he will beat you.  Every.  Time.<\/p>\n<p>And should you have any of the tart left over at the end of the night, know that it\u2019s just as good on its own &#8211; the next day, maybe, as an after-lunch sweet.  So long, of course, as you eat your kale.  Don\u2019t forget that part.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Apple Tart<\/span><br \/>Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPlatter-Figs-Other-Recipes%2Fdp%2F1579653464%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1224221477%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">A Platter of Figs and Other Recipes<\/span><\/a>, by David Tanis<\/p>\n<p>This is especially delicious with a little bit of honey-sweetened whipped cream.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">For crust<\/span>:<br \/>4 Tbsp. ice water, plus more as needed<br \/>3\u20444 tsp. apple cider vinegar<br \/>1 1\u20442 cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>1 Tbsp. sugar<br \/>3\u20444 tsp. salt<br \/>9 Tbsp. (4 1\u20442 oz.) cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">For filling<\/span>:<br \/>6 to 7 medium Granny Smith apples (about 2 1\u20442 pounds)<br \/>1 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling<br \/>1 cup water<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">To prepare the crust<\/span>:<br \/>In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine 4 Tbsp. ice water and the cider vinegar.<\/p>\n<p>In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Pulse to blend. Add the butter, and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal; there should be no pieces of butter bigger than a large pea. With the motor running, slowly add the water-vinegar mixture, processing just until moist clumps form. If you pick up a handful of the dough and squeeze it in your fist, it should hold together. If the dough seems a bit dry, add more ice water by the teaspoon, pulsing to incorporate. I sometimes find that 1 additional teaspoon is perfect.<\/p>\n<p>Turn the dough out onto a wooden board or clean countertop, and gather it, massaging and pressing, until it just holds together. Shape it into a ball, and press it into a disk about 1 1\u20442 inches thick. If the disk cracks a bit at the edges, don\u2019t worry; just pinch the cracks together as well as you can. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, and then press it a bit more, massaging away any cracks around the edges, allowing the constraint of the plastic wrap to help you form it into a smooth disk. Refrigerate the wrapped dough for at least 2 hours. (Dough can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw it in refrigerator overnight before using.) Before rolling it out, allow the dough to soften slightly at room temperature.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">To assemble<\/span>:<br \/>Set an oven rack to the middle position, and preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F.<\/p>\n<p>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a rectangle measuring approximately 11 by 16 inches.  Transfer the dough to a rimmed baking sheet.  Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate while you prepare the filling.<\/p>\n<p>Peel the apples, and cut them into quarters.  Cut out the cores, and toss them into a medium saucepan.  To the cores, add 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water.  Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.  Simmer until the mixture has reduced to a thick syrup.  Strain out and discard the solids, and set the syrup aside.  Meanwhile, cut the apples into thin \u2013 roughly 1\/8- to \u00bc-inch-thick \u2013 slices.  Arrange the apple slices over the pastry in 5 rows, overlapping them like cards in solitaire.  Sprinkle sugar generously over the apples. [I used a tablespoon \u2013 the eating kind, not the measuring kind \u2013 to do this, and I used about 1 slightly heaping spoonful for every 1 to 1 \u00bd rows of apple slices.] If you want to, fold up the edges of the dough a little bit, to form a small rim.<\/p>\n<p>Bake the tart until the pastry is crisp and golden brown and the apples are beginning to color, about 35 to 45 minutes. [If your apples aren\u2019t getting much color, don\u2019t worry; if the pastry is looking right and the apples are at least tender, you should be fine.  My apples stayed pretty pale.]  Cool on the pan on a rack.<\/p>\n<p>Just before serving, rewarm the glaze.  Slide the tart from the pan onto a cutting board.  Brush the apples with the warm glaze.  Slice, and serve.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So, have you eaten your boiled kale yet?
