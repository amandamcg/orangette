My apartment had deep-pile carpet the color of weak tea and a floodlit view of a parking lot, but it was mine, <i>mine mine mine mine mine mine mine<\/i>. Even getting a utilities bill was exhilarating: it was in <i>my<\/i> name! I bought cheap produce at the stand a few blocks east, found a good Thai curry place a few blocks to the west, and got takeout from an Indian restaurant down the street. I started this blog in that apartment in 2004, and I lived there when I met Brandon in 2005. At some point around then, before he moved to Seattle in 2006 and we packed up my stuff and hauled it to the Ballard duplex we\u2019d rented, somebody told me about a restaurant nearby called Eva. It was small, well-regarded, a polished neighborhood place with a menu closely tied to the seasons, the kind of menu that used kale before any of us knew the word, let alone dreamed of uniting it with the word\u00a0<i>chip<\/i>.\u00a0I was still a student, and most days, I couldn\u2019t afford a restaurant like that. But somebody told me that Eva had a spectacular young pastry chef, a woman named Dana Cree, so I saved up, or maybe I waited until my mother came to town, and I went.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5925e-_f7a53631.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5925e-_f7a53631.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Dana was doing a series of throwback desserts, I think &#8211; if I\u2019m getting this wrong, and I\u2019m almost certainly getting it wrong, I hope she will tell me &#8211; and I seem to remember having a sexed-up homemade <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ding_Dong\" target=\"_blank\">Ding Dong<\/a>, and maybe a chocolate rice pudding with caramelized Rice Krispies on top, and a butterscotch pudding, dark and rightly salted.

It\u2019s simple, and it\u2019s perfect, and every spring, almost a decade later, it\u2019s still the rhubarb recipe that I think of first.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c50d7-_f7a53781.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/c50d7-_f7a53781.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I\u2019ve already got plenty of rhubarb recipes, and you probably do, too. A lot of days, I think the best thing you can do with rhubarb is\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2010\/03\/a-lot-of-rhubarb\/\" target=\"_blank\">roast it<\/a>, period. All the other days, though, I think of Dana\u2019s rhubarb compote, cooked on the stovetop until it\u2019s thick, spiked with orange liqueur and softened with butter. It comes together in twenty minutes and keeps for a week, easy. And though there\u2019s booze in there, it\u2019s not boozy; the orange liqueur is there to support the rhubarb flavor, to underline it, amplify it, join in the chorus. The butter, for its part, is also there to quietly support, smoothing the rough edges from the rhubarb and giving it a subtle, welcome roundness. Dana\u2019s rhubarb compote might be my very favorite thing to stir into a morning bowl of plain yogurt, less sweet and softer than my second favorite,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2014\/10\/the-satisfaction\/\" target=\"_blank\">jam<\/a>. You could also serve it with <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2011\/06\/this-ones-coming-with-me\/\" target=\"_blank\">shortcakes<\/a> and whipped cream, as a sauce for ice cream, spooned into <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplyrecipes.com\/recipes\/pavlova\/\" target=\"_blank\">pavlova<\/a>, slathered on pancakes or <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2010\/05\/you-deserve-a-waffle\/\" target=\"_blank\">waffles<\/a> or French toast, or &#8211; my friend <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew<\/a>\u2019s idea &#8211; on top of a toasted <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bakepedia.com\/model-bakerys-english-muffins-recipe\/\" target=\"_blank\">English muffin<\/a> spread with mascarpone.

Her version suggests halving the rhubarb stalks lengthwise before slicing, so you wind up with 1-cm cubes; I get lazy and just cut the stalks crosswise into chunks. The chunks are still small enough that some break down during cooking, while others just get soft and plump, making for a variation in texture that I like very much. As for sugar, Dana\u2019s version uses \u00be cup sugar for 1 pound rhubarb, but I\u2019ve come to prefer mine with slightly less, roughly a scant 2\/3 cup. I know that \u00be cup, or even 2\/3 cup, might sound like a lot, but the rhubarb can take it. You could use less, sure, but keep in mind that the sugar also helps thicken the rhubarb\u2019s juices and give the compote its body, so if you cut back too much, the texture will be different. The most recent time I made it, I doubled the recipe and used 1 \u00bc cups of sugar, just FYI.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 pound (455 grams) rhubarb stalks, trimmed and sliced into \u00be-inch chunks\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd to \u00be cup (100 to 150 grams) sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 Tbsp.

Set it aside while you melt the butter in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the rhubarb, the sugar, and the orange liqueur. Allow to cook, undisturbed, for about 2 minutes, until the rhubarb begins to release its juices. Then gently stir, and continue to cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the rhubarb is very juicy and those juices begin to thicken. The compote is ready when the rhubarb is tender and beginning to fall apart and the juices look thick, about 10 to 15 minutes. This is a cook-it-until-it-looks-right-to-you situation: trust your judgement.<\/p>\n<p>Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator, and serve cold, cool, or warm.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: maybe 1 pint?
