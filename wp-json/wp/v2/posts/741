It\u2019s been ten years, but I know it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/2fe85-polafreshleekstwo-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5515105579630155826\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/2fe85-polafreshleekstwo-11.jpg?w=293\" alt=\"\" width=\"1210\" height=\"1237\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nCorentine was my host mother in Paris, the year that I was 21 and studying abroad. She had the most magnificent name I had ever heard and something a little <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jane_Birkin\">Jane Birkin<\/a>, just a little, about her looks. Whenever someone asks me how I learned to cook or how I got into food, I usually credit my parents, but I should also credit Corentine. She and I didn\u2019t have a lot in common, but food was enough, and we seized it. I ate at her table for six months, and she taught me what she thought I should know. She taught me how to eat cheese, how to make vinaigrette from scratch, and how to shell and snap the head from a whole cooked shrimp. She also taught me how to peel an apple in one long, curling, ribbon-like strip, which, it turns out, I still cannot actually do. Perhaps most importantly, she taught me that a plain <a href=\"http:\/\/chocolateandzucchini.com\/archives\/2003\/10\/my_grandmothers_pear_cake.php\">butter cake with pears<\/a>, served on a very cold night, can feel like some kind of miracle. She also taught me about leeks. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Poireaux<\/span>, she said.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d never thought about leeks before. I\u2019m sure I grew up eating them in things, and certainly in potato leek soup, but I\u2019d never paid attention. I\u2019d certainly never eaten them the way she served them: on their own, as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">poireaux vinaigrette<\/span>, steamed to a degree of doneness best described as pleasantly comatose and then sent out on a platter, towing a gravy boat of vinaigrette closely behind. She had two little boys, ages seven and nine, or maybe nine and eleven, I can\u2019t remember, and they used to fight over the sweet white part closest to the root. I couldn\u2019t believe that they actually seemed to know something about vegetable anatomy, much less cared enough to call dibs. I couldn\u2019t believe how much I liked those leeks.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/76c39-polaleeksclear-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5515465849706411250\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/76c39-polaleeksclear-11.jpg?w=294\" alt=\"\" width=\"1210\" height=\"1236\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nBehold: a mess of leeks vinaigrette, with emphasis on <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">mess<\/span>. (Corentine\u2019s plating was much neater &#8211; as, for the record, was her hair.) I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s taken me this long to write about this dish. In the abstract, and particularly said aloud, its name sounds like some sort of unusual plumbing problem, but leeks vinaigrette is a classic, a very common first course in French kitchens. You\u2019ve probably heard of it. Maybe you\u2019ve tried it. It\u2019s one of those concepts that slips quietly into your repertoire, and before you know it, ten years have gone by, and you\u2019ve forgotten the ages of the sons of the woman who taught it to you, and you\u2019re about to turn 32, not 22, and still, you\u2019re making that dish. I\u2019m still making leeks vinaigrette. Sometimes as often as once a week.<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7a946-polacookedleeks-41.jpg\"><br \/>\n<\/a><br \/>\nLeeks are harvested year-round in some places, but I usually think of them as a cooler weather vegetable. (In the summer, if the temperature gets too hot, they can wind up with thick, woody cores.) They showed up at the farmers\u2019 market here a few weeks ago, and I pounced on them. They\u2019re still young and skinny, about the same diameter as a bottle cap, and they\u2019re very sweet, which makes them ideal for simple preparations like leeks vinaigrette. We put them on the menu for our <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2010\/08\/but-then.html\">family dinner at Delancey on August 31<\/a>, and with the help of our friend <a href=\"http:\/\/olaiyalandcatering.com\/\">Olaiya<\/a>, who was cooking with us that night, we tried something a little different.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7a946-polacookedleeks-41.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5515107542416706978\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7a946-polacookedleeks-41.jpg?w=294\" alt=\"\" width=\"1211\" height=\"1235\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nUsually I would just steam the leeks, blot them to get rid of excess water, and then lay them out on a plate and drizzle them with dressing, \u00e0 la Corentine. But this time, we decided to boil them in big pots of salted water, both to cook them faster &#8211; we had 40 people to feed &#8211; and to infuse them with some seasoning. Then, while they were still hot, we tossed them with a good amount of vinaigrette, hoping that they would absorb it as they cooled. Rather than tasting like plain leeks topped with vinaigrette &#8211; which tastes fine; don\u2019t get me wrong &#8211; these tasted like a third, even finer thing: leeks <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">fused with<\/span> vinaigrette, leeksandvinaigrette, rich and saucy. We served them warm, topped with a little more vinaigrette, chopped hard-boiled egg, and chopped bacon, and it was so good, so properly early fall-like, that I made it again yesterday. Only without the egg and bacon, because I got lazy. Either way, I think you\u2019ll like it.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Leeks vinaigrette<\/h2>\n        <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2010-09-11T23:12:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/741?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>I\u2019ve written this recipe with wiggle room on the quantities of vinegar and mustard, and you should feel free to tweak it to your liking. It\u2019s hard to go wrong, and anyway, your vinegars, oils, and leeks may taste different from mine. Whatever you do, it\u2019s important to use a good, strong mustard for this dressing. I like the brands Edmond Fallot, Roland Extra Strong, and Beaufor. Keep in mind, too, that once a jar of mustard has been opened, it slowly loses its potency, so if you\u2019ve had your jar for a while, you might want to invest in a new one.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 to 3 Tbsp. white wine vinegar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 to 2 tsp.

Gradually whisk in the olive oil, mixing until emulsified. Taste. This dressing should be fairly bright, and the mustard flavor should come through, but not too powerfully. Adjust as needed with vinegar, mustard, and\/or salt. When you\u2019re happy with it, add the shallots, whisking to blend. Set aside. Be sure to taste it again later, just before tossing it with the leeks, so that if necessary, you can adjust it according to their flavor.<\/p>\n<p>Lay a clean kitchen towel on the counter near the stove. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt it well. It should taste like sea water.<\/p>\n<p>While the water comes to a boil, prepare the leeks. Trim away the hair-like roots, but take care not too cut in too far; you want the leek to stay intact. Cut off and discard the dark green leafy parts, leaving just the white and pale green stalk. Starting about 1 inch from the root end, so as to keep the white part intact, cut lengthwise down the middle of the leek. (If you were to splay the cut leek open, it should look like a stubby Y.) Wash the leeks well under running water, flushing any dirt from between the layers. Boil until they are very, very tender and yield easily to a knife. Their color will become muted, and they may be falling apart a little. That\u2019s okay. To be sure they\u2019re done, taste one: it should taste sweet, with no trace of raw flavor. The amount of time that this will take depends on their size, but it will probably take longer than you think. Ten minutes is a good bet.<\/p>\n<p>Draining the leeks as well as you can, transfer them to the kitchen towel on the counter. Blot and press them dry. (Don\u2019t burn yourself!) While they\u2019re still hot, put them in a bowl, and toss them with a generous amount of the dressing. Allow to cool at least slightly before serving.<\/p>\n<p>Serve warm or at room temperature, with more dressing spooned on top and a pinch or two of salt. If you want to make it a little fancier, garnish with bacon and\/or chopped egg.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 3 to 4 servings (as a side dish or first course)<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Somewhere, a woman named Corentine is serving leeks vinaigrette for dinner.
