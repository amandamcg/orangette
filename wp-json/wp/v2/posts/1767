She moved through the house as though on pointe\u2014softly but decisively\u2014and she wore silver bracelets that clicked delicately against each other when she lifted her hand to secure the barrettes in her long brown hair. She was also very Catholic, with four children, ages 9 to 17; a Labrador puppy; and a husband who\u2019d gone\u2014or rather, all but moved\u2014to Canada to find work. It was complicated and exhausting. She did an admirable job, and she often fell asleep in the bathtub after dinner. But most importantly, dear reader, <strong>my host mother was the French equivalent of a Tupperware saleswoman<\/strong>. She tested, cooked in, and sold <a href=\"http:\/\/www.demarleusa.com\/\">Flexipan and Silpat<\/a> products, those fantastic (and fantastically expensive) silicone baking pans, molds, and sheets. I was lucky enough to live under her roof\u2014and within close proximity to her kitchen\u2014for six months. You can well imagine the glory that might have been, <strong>had I not taken down the crucifix<\/strong> she\u2019d hung on my bedroom wall.<\/p>\n<p>I arrived that fall, barely twenty-one, deep in my smoky-black eye makeup phase\u2014an era that hasn\u2019t yet ended, actually\u2014and with the short, spiky hair I wore throughout college. I was also a <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/09\/on-roasted-chicken-and-revolution.html\">pseudo vegetarian<\/a>, which threw more than a few grains of sand into the gears of her well-oiled kitchen routine. But she sensed that I was only slightly heretical and very eager to please\u2014still my greatest weakness, I\u2019ll freely admit\u2014and <strong>so she took me on, gently correcting my French, delivering clean sheets to my door with admirable regularity, and teaching me how to eat<\/strong>. I arrived a somewhat calculating eater, well-schooled in nutrition and suspecting that butterfat was the devil\u2019s work, and I left smuggling <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fromages.com\/fiche.php?id=110\">aged ch\u00e8vres<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fromages.com\/fiche.php?id=127\">mimolette<\/a> in my suitcase.<\/p>\n<p>Each weeknight at eight I\u2019d climb the stairs to the second-floor kitchen and join my squealing pre-teen host brothers (<em>Ta gueule!<\/em> <em>Casse-toi! <\/em>(Shut up! Get the hell out of here!)) and catty teenage host sisters (<em>Ta jupe est moche, tu sais<\/em>?<em> <\/em>(Your skirt is ugly, you know?)) at the table. We\u2019d begin with a simple grated carrot or beet salad, or half a grapefruit. The boys might argue over the <strong>warm steamed leeks with vinaigrette<\/strong>, each wanting the sweet white part closest to the root. Then, depending on the season, we\u2019d move on to a gruy\u00e8re souffl\u00e9; pasta with a sauce of tuna, chopped tomatoes, and saut\u00e9ed onions; or <a href=\"http:\/\/forums.egullet.org\/index.php?s=7e47301a1154e67fe9abcffa9fabae5d&amp;showtopic=41005&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=577922\"><strong><em>tartiflette<\/em><\/strong><\/a><em>,<\/em> a wintery baked casserole of potatoes, lardons (absent from my half of the dish, <em>merci<\/em>), and rich Reblochon cheese from Savoie. It was at that table that I first ate <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/01\/outline-of-theory-of-cabbage.html\">sauerkraut<\/a> and learned of <strong>the nightly cheese plate<\/strong>, stinky and irresistible, with hunks of baguette from the boulangerie next door. And of course there was always dessert: homemade applesauce, a grandmother-style <a href=\"http:\/\/chocolateandzucchini.com\/archives\/cat_on_a_sugar_high.php#000150\">apple or pear cake<\/a>, or in January, a <a href=\"http:\/\/scally.typepad.com\/cest_moi_qui_lai_fait\/2005\/01\/galette_des_roi.html\">galette des rois<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At least one night each week we\u2019d have a \u201cFlexipan dinner,\u201d a meal centered on a recipe that my host mother was testing in her silicone molds. Her individual tartlets of caramelized endive with goat cheese were staggeringly good, as was the almost-flourless chocolate cake, which quickly became a staple. But my favorite were the <strong>squatty, ugly, and completely delicious <em>bouchons au thon<\/em> (literally, tuna corks),<\/strong> a mixture of canned tuna, tomato paste, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, gruy\u00e8re, and eggs, baked in muffin molds.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Bouchon_au_thon_side_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/03\/Bouchon_au_thon_side_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>With a texture somewhere between the filling of a quiche and freshly-made country pat\u00e9, the bouchons tamed the flat, fishy pungency of canned tuna with the smooth richness of dairy and the sweetness of tomato. <strong>I gave thanks daily for all that Flexipan brought to my life<\/strong>, but mainly for bouchons au thon.<\/p>\n<p>And as luck would have it, that spring, when my host mother went to visit her husband in Canada, she left me and my youngest host sister alone with a freezer blessedly full of bouchons. Seizing the opportunity, I invited my brand-new French boyfriend over for a dinner of the little tuna corks, roasted vegetables, carefully selected cheeses, crispy-crusted baguettes, and oatmeal chocolate-chip cookies. It was a pure, starry-eyed triumph all around, right through to the next morning, and frankly, I credit the bouchons. I also credit them with earning me, upon my host mother\u2019s return, my first and only <em>\u201cMolly, ce n\u2019est pas un h\u00f4tel!\u201d<\/em> (Molly, this is not a hotel!) speech. I was almost as horrified as she was; <strong>apparently I was more heretical than even I\u2019d known.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And it was only the beginning, in so many ways.<br \/>When I flew back to the States one painful month later, I tucked the recipe for bouchons au thon in with the contraband cheese.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bouchons au Thon<\/strong><br \/>Adapted from Demarle, Inc., and my host mother<\/p>\n<p>These bouchons\u2014a crustless tuna quiche of sorts, I suppose\u2014are delicious warm or at room temperature, with a green salad and a good baguette.<\/p>\n<p>180 grams canned tuna in water (preferably chunk light), drained<br \/>3 Tbs tomato paste<br \/>5 Tbs cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche<br \/>3 large eggs<br \/>1 cup finely grated gruy\u00e8re cheese<br \/>Salt<br \/>Pepper<br \/>2 Tbs finely chopped Italian (flat-leaf) parsley<br \/>\u00bc cup minced onion<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit, and spray 8 wells of a muffin tin with cooking spray (unless, of course, you have a silicone muffin mold, in which case no greasing is necessary). [I&#8217;ve also baked the batter in a single 7-inch silicone cake mold, which essentially negates the name &#8220;bouchon&#8221; but makes for a nice variation.]<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, break up the tuna with a fork, smashing it to a rough paste. Add the tomato paste, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, eggs, gruy\u00e8re, a good pinch of salt, Italian parsley, and onion, and mix well. The batter should be relatively smooth.<\/p>\n<p>Spoon the batter evenly into 8 wells of the muffin tin, and bake for 20-25 minutes, until set and golden around the edges. [If you choose to use a 7-inch mold as mentioned above, the baking time will be longer; bake until the batter looks set and does not jiggle.]<\/p>\n<p>Serves 4 as a light meal with side dishes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My French host mother was tall, trim, and proper, with a sing-song voice and a name that skipped and chimed and rang off the tongue.
