I call it Cabbage with Hot Sauce.  It doesn\u2019t look like much to speak of, I know, and I\u2019m sorry about that.  But if you eat it alongside some toast and cheddar, or a fried egg, one with a nice, saucy yolk, you won\u2019t think twice.  I hope.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve been eating cabbage this way for a while, but it\u2019s such a plain, off-the-cuff method &#8211; hardly even a recipe, really &#8211; that until yesterday, it never occurred to me to mention it here.  I guess it\u2019s a little like the <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/01\/brown-bag-it.html\">chickpea salad<\/a> that way, although more feisty in flavor.  Brandon came up with the idea a few years ago, when he was still living in New York.  I was visiting him, and we had bought a green cabbage for some recipe that I now can\u2019t remember, and after making whatever it was, half of the cabbage was still sitting in the crisper drawer.  So one day, for a late breakfast, Brandon fished it out, sliced it into thin ribbons, and chucked it into a hot wok with a dribble of oil, a spoonful of hot sauce, and some soy sauce for seasoning.  We ate it with hummus and pita, or maybe it was cheddar and some bread.  I can\u2019t remember.  But it was delicious &#8211; spicy and earthy and a little sweet from the fire under the wok &#8211; and the next day, when I flew back to Seattle, I took the leftovers in a to-go container that we found in his housemate\u2019s cabinet, along with a bagel and cream cheese from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/absolute-bagels-new-york\">Absolute Bagels<\/a>.  It sounds like an iffy combination, but somehow it was spectacular, both hot and soothing, salty and sweet, and I was both so happy and so desperately sad to leave, and sometimes, when I sit very still and let my mind go to the places where it goes when I don\u2019t stop it, I miss those days so much.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/966c8-polasundaycabbage3-1crop1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/966c8-polasundaycabbage3-1crop1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5295756716197252578\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>But luckily, I did marry him, and now I can have that cabbage any time, so it\u2019s okay.  It\u2019s also nice that he has hands that photograph well, and that he doesn\u2019t strangle me with them when I stand up in the middle of lunch and scream, \u201cWAIT!  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">DON\u2019T MOVE<\/span>.  Where\u2019s my camera?  I\u2019ve got to climb up on the chair&#8230;.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, so now the cabbage is yours.  That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say.  It\u2019s not dinner party material, particularly, but if you have a soft spot for cabbage, and if you have some hot sauce rolling around in your refrigerator door, it is a very fine way to put them to use.  We ate it for lunch yesterday, with fried eggs from the farmers\u2019 market, and it was so simple and right that I decided that you needed to know about it.  And the leftovers today, with a couple pieces of toast and some slices of sharp white cheddar, something rich and cooling, made me feel all the more certain.<\/p>\n<p>Have a good week, everyone.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Cabbage with Hot Sauce<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is more of a method than a recipe, so the quantities I\u2019ve listed below are only approximate.  Just taste as you go, and tweak to your liking.  It\u2019s hard to mess this up, as long as you get some color on the cabbage.<\/p>\n<p>When choosing an oil for this, be sure to choose one with a high smoke point, the safest bet for high-heat cooking.  We usually use canola oil, because I keep it around for making <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/03\/all-we-ever-really-want-to-do.html\">granola<\/a>, but we have also used peanut oil and grapeseed oil.   (Or, if you\u2019re the type to have lard lying around &#8211; <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">ooh la la<\/span> &#8211; you could use that.  It has a high smoke point too.)  To learn more about high-temperature oils and fats, click over <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cooking_oil\">here<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thekitchn.com\/thekitchn\/ingredients-pantry\/which-is-better-vegetable-oil-vs-olive-oil-061853\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u00bd head green cabbage, quartered and sliced into \u00bc-inch-thick ribbons<br \/>\u00bd medium fennel bulb, thinly sliced (optional)<br \/>Canola oil, or another oil with a similarly high smoke point<br \/>\u00bc tsp. to 1 tsp. sambal oelek, to taste<br \/>Soy sauce, to taste<br \/>Salt, to taste (optional)<\/p>\n<p>Place a wok over high heat.  Let it heat thoroughly; it should even smell hot. Working quickly, pour in a glug of oil* and then immediately add the cabbage and the fennel, if using.  Stir briefly to coat with oil, and then leave it alone for a minute or so, to allow the vegetables to begin to take on some color. Then add sambal oelek to taste, and stir again.  (If you have a hood over your stove, turn on the fan!  The hot sauce gives off spicy fumes.)  Continue to cook until the vegetables are browned in spots and wilted.  It won\u2019t take long.  Then add a glug of soy sauce, and stir well again.  Taste, and season with more soy sauce or salt as needed.<\/p>\n<p>Serve hot or warm.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 2-4 servings, depending on what else you\u2019re having<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">* Be sure to have a lid nearby, or some baking soda, since hot oil always runs a risk of flaring up.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Monday.
