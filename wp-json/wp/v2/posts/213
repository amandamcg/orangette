And because they were feeling nice, my publisher updated it to include a sample chapter of <i>Delancey<\/i>, too, at the very end. I love that they did that.

It\u2019s directed by Cameron Crowe, and it\u2019s wonderful, and I say that as someone who has always, actually, leaned more Nirvana than Pearl Jam. <i>PJ20 <\/i>is as much about Seattle, my adopted city, as it is about Pearl Jam, and one thing I particularly love about the film is its exploration of the unusual tradition of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VUb450Alpps&amp;feature=kp\" target=\"_blank\">collaboration<\/a>, rather than competition, between Seattle bands. \u00a0Brandon and I have experienced the same phenomenon in the restaurant business here &#8211; and I write a bit about it in <i>Delancey &#8211; <\/i>and I don\u2019t know, but the whole film is just very inspiring. Brandon is going to kill me for publicly admitting what losers we are, but both he and I choked up the first time we watched it.<\/p>\n<p>Last, but not least, I was invited to deliver the keynote speech at <a href=\"http:\/\/foodblogsouth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Food Blog South<\/a> in Birmingham, Alabama, at the end of January, and yesterday, the esteemed Dianne Jacob posted <a href=\"http:\/\/diannej.com\/2014\/molly-wizenberg-let-your-writing-speak-for-itself-and-be-proud-of-it\/\" target=\"_blank\">an excerpt from my talk<\/a>.
