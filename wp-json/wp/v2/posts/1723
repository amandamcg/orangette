What follows is a mish-mash of the good, the bad, and the ugly: I\u2019ll let you decide which is which.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Bologna Roll-Ups<br \/><\/strong><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/03\/my-mother-and-eggs-la-franaise.html\">My mother<\/a> was staunchly anti-\u201cjunk food\u201d: no Cheetos, which she distainfully dubbed \u201cStyrofoam peanuts\u201d; no Hostess Twinkies, except for the occasional pack smuggled in by a kindly babysitter; and no sugared cereals, save for the Cinnamon Toast Crunch I\u2019d filch from my best friend <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/07\/on-misunderstood-mousse-and-girl-who.html\">Jennifer<\/a>\u2019s pantry. Somehow, however, certain anomalous items escaped my mother\u2019s sanctions, most notably <strong>Oscar Meyer beef bologna<\/strong>. In fact, I\u2019m quite nearly made of the stuff: in the first several years of my life, I ate enough <strong>flabby, pale pink, processed lunch meat<\/strong> to probably permanently alter my cellular makeup. But I\u2019m not talking bologna sandwiches. Most of the time, I asked instead for what my mother called the \u201cbologna roll-up,\u201d a <strong>slippery creation<\/strong> she\u2019d herself invented. It consisted of a slab of bologna smeared with Hellman\u2019s mayonnaise, rolled into a thin cigar shape, and eaten out of hand. Though perhaps best described as an <em>experience <\/em>rather than an edible item, at the time I loved it\u2014fatty, smooth, saltylicious. Really, sometimes mother <em>does<\/em> know best.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. My raspberries-and-cream-cheese birthday cake<br \/><\/strong><br \/>In 1984, the Oklahoma City Junior League published a cookbook optimistically titled <em>Superlatives<\/em>. My mother, ever wise, bought a first-edition copy, and sometime thereafter I began celebrating my birthdays with its raspberries-and-cream-cheese layer cake. Among other things, the recipe calls for a box of white cake mix and half <strong>a box of raspberry Jello (still in powder form)<\/strong>. The cake layers, tall and rosy, were cloaked in a cream cheese frosting dyed carnation pink with the other half of the raspberry Jello powder. Lest you have doubts, let me assure you that it was delicious: sweet, moist, and tangy with berries\u2014or facsimiles thereof. In fact, the recipe was so well-loved\u2014even by our (now dearly departed) dog Sasha, who once ate a still-warm cake layer right off the kitchen counter\u2014that the page is covered with day-glo splatters of dried frosting. Actually, writing this gives me an oddly powerful urge to crack the spine of <em>Superlatives<\/em> and resurrect the cake in all its <strong>pink glory<\/strong> for my birthday next month. Mea culpa.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. \u201cBreakfast for dinner\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sometime during her <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/02\/on-spandex-mothers-genius-and-whole.html\">aerobics<\/a> phase, my mother did a stint on Weight Watchers. Though its meal suggestions were not exactly the stuff of dreams, we stumbled upon one that would stay on our kitchen table long after the diet had gone: <strong>steamed spinach topped with an over-easy egg and shredded sharp cheddar cheese<\/strong>. We called it \u201cbreakfast for dinner,\u201d and for many years, it was a weekly regular on the household menu. Though today I\u2019d generally opt for saut\u00e9ed spinach, a poached egg, and a finer cheddar than the orange block we used to buy, when I want an easy dinner, something comforting yet clean, I still make \u201cbreakfast.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Beluga caviar in the bathroom<br \/><\/strong><br \/>Despite my early love for bologna and items flavored with raspberry Jello powder, I knew a good thing when I ate it. To a large degree, I owe that to <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/two-years.html\"><strong>my father<\/strong><\/a><strong>, who proudly introduced me to beluga caviar well before I even owned a training bra<\/strong>. He\u2019d have it shipped in on special occasions from faraway places, and we\u2019d scoop up the tiny, grey-black eggs with delicate mother-of-pearl spoons. For my parents\u2019 anniversary, there was almost always caviar, and <strong>for my mother\u2019s 40th birthday, my father delivered a tin of beluga and a bottle of champagne, both on ice, to their bathroom<\/strong>, where she was dressing to go out for dinner. And I remember several caviar-filled New Year\u2019s Eves spent down the street at the home of family friends <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/01\/on-industry-indolence-and-italian.html\">the Fretwells<\/a>, where we\u2019d crowd around the coffee table in the living room to eat caviar with homemade toast points, sieved egg, sour cream, and diced red onions. And then, the deathly expensive fish eggs devoured, their daughter Leslie and I would revert to normal activities, such as hiding in the closet, prank-calling, and pretending to be Harriet the Spy. Needless to say, my New Year\u2019s Eves as an adult haven\u2019t yet been able to measure up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. My father\u2019s Saturday lunch<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now, item #5 isn\u2019t something I used to consume myself, but rather a memory of a ritual that took place in our kitchen nearly every Saturday morning: my father\u2019s post-<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/04\/for-french-toast-master-on-his-76th.html\">garage-sale<\/a> lunch. <strong>Without fail, it featured two ingredients: eggs and beer<\/strong>. Often it was an omelet, made in a heavy pan with a blue rubber handle and filled with (too much) sharp cheddar cheese, feta, or saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. If it wasn\u2019t an omelet, it was egg salad, a chunky improvised mixture of hard-boiled eggs, (too much) mayonnaise, diced celery, curry powder, salt, and pepper, mashed together in a red-and-white enamel bowl. On the side, he\u2019d toast an English muffin or a slice of whatever bread happened to lurk by the toaster, and he\u2019d wash it all down with a foamy ale, sipped from a thick stem glass with grapes and grapevines in relief around its sides. I can still picture him sitting there at the table, reading <em>The Daily Oklahoman<\/em> or a copy of <em>The New Yorker<\/em>, his beer glass ringing against the marble-topped table each time he set it down. I\u2019m not sure why I haven\u2019t tried to recreate the scene myself, here at my steel-topped table in Seattle, but something tells me it\u2019s only a matter of time.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">*Thanks, Kate, for offering the incentive to take this proverbial trip down memory lane.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yes, dear reader, it happened to me too.
