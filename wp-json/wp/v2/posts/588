I learned how to make it more than a year ago, in early 2010, when my friend Matthew and I taped the first episode of our podcast, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/\">Spilled Milk<\/a>. The topic of the show that day was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/2010\/01\/07\/episode-1-fried-eggs\/\">fried eggs<\/a>, and Matthew made this rice to serve with them, to sop up the yolks. (We tape at Matthew\u2019s place, almost always over lunch.) In the 17 or so months since, I\u2019ve probably made kimchi fried rice close to 17 times. I know that fried rice is supposed to be about using up leftover rice, but I don\u2019t let that slow me down: I now make rice for the sole purpose of making kimchi fried rice. Did it just the other day. And seeing as this blog is the place where I put my best stuff, I thought it was time to finally record it here, to file it as a Keeper.<\/p>\n<p>I am not any kind of expert on fried rice, and I don\u2019t think Matthew thinks of himself that way, either &#8211; though he\u2019s welcome to correct me, if he does. But I\u2019ve eaten kimchi fried rice in a couple of restaurants in the past few months, and the version that Matthew taught me is still my favorite. It begins with bacon, which you cook slowly, so that it gives off a nice amount of fat &#8211; that fat is important in fried rice &#8211; and then you add some chopped Napa cabbage kimchi (the riper, the better). When the kimchi is hot and beginning to look a little wilty at the edges, you add cooked rice, preferably a day or two old, the rice you\u2019re going to make today. And into that, a few minutes later, you stir a little sesame oil and butter. Kimchi and butter are <i>crazy<\/i> for each other. It\u2019s really spectacular, what happens to the sharp funk and sting of fermented cabbage when it shakes the smoothing hand of butter. Spectacular. So you\u2019ve got that, plus the fragrant sesame oil, the bacon, and the rice, and a bowl, and it\u2019s hard to imagine needing anything else, ever, in the entire universe &#8211; except maybe some sesame seeds and sliced scallions, for garnish.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/02406-polakimchifriedrice-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5611964555561456578\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/02406-polakimchifriedrice-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1125\" height=\"866\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>And a fried egg!

They sell a couple of different brands, but I usually buy Island Spring. It\u2019s made about half an hour away, on Vashon Island, and it has good flavor and heat. Matthew, however, makes his own kimchi, and it\u2019s fantastic. Maybe he\u2019ll teach me how someday. David Lebovitz also has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidlebovitz.com\/2008\/02\/a-kimchi-recipe\/\">a recipe for it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As for rice, the best type for this recipe is Calrose, a medium-grain, Japanese-style white rice from California. But I\u2019ve also used Thai jasmine rice, which is nice &#8211; though when you fry it, it tends to stick aggressively to the pan. Whatever you use, cook it a day or two ahead, cool it, and chill it. If possible, allow it to come to room temperature before frying.<\/p>\n<p>About the pan: if you have a well-seasoned wok, use it. Or, if you\u2019re stuck with just a heavy skillet and an electric range, as I am, that\u2019s okay. I use my largest cast-iron pan. It\u2019s nicely seasoned, but the rice still sticks a bit. It\u2019s annoying, but not annoying enough to keep me from making fried rice. (Just put some hot water in the pan when you\u2019re finished, soak briefly, and the stuck rice will come right out.) One word of warning: I wouldn\u2019t use a nonstick pan. The coating isn\u2019t safe for use over high heat.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and if I were you, I might fry two eggs per person. But it\u2019s really up to you.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            4 strips bacon, cut crosswise into \u00bd-inch pieces\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 cups Napa cabbage kimchi (see above), diced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            4 cups cooked rice (see above)\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, plus more for frying eggs\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tsp. sesame oil\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Sesame seeds, for garnish\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Sliced scallions or sweet spring onions, for garnish\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Eggs, for frying          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Put the bacon in a large skillet or wok, and place over medium heat. (I find that by starting the bacon in a cold skillet, I can get it to render more fat than it does when I start it in a hot skillet, and that\u2019s helpful for this recipe.) Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon is cooked through but still tender. Add the kimchi, and cook for several minutes, until the kimchi is hot and maybe even beginning to brown in spots.<\/p>\n<p>When the kimchi looks right, raise the heat to high, and add the rice, stirring well. Cook, stirring occasionally, for several minutes, until the rice is hot and beginning to brown. (If the rice is wanting to stick to the pan, it\u2019s going to be hard to brown it properly, but don\u2019t worry. Just make sure it\u2019s nice and hot. It\u2019ll still taste very good.)<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in another skillet, warm some butter and fry as many eggs as you\u2019d like, seasoning with salt to taste.<\/p>\n<p>When the rice is ready, stir in the butter and sesame oil, and season with salt to taste. Divide between two or three bowls, and top each with a fried egg or two. Garnish with sesame seeds and scallions.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 2 generous or 3 moderate servings<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Listen, I know it\u2019s a holiday weekend.
