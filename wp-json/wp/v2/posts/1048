I still can\u2019t believe that we even got here, given <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amateurgourmet.com\/2008\/12\/the_kindness_of.html\">how snowed-under<\/a> Seattle is right now.   The day before we left, we watched people snowboard down the hill on 65th Street in Ballard.   On the way to the airport, we passed a guy on cross-country skis, making his way slowly, cheerfully, up the road.  It was all pretty dreamy, really, so long as you didn\u2019t have anywhere important to be.  <a href=\"http:\/\/seattlepi.nwsource.com\/local\/393113_airport22.html\">Like the airport<\/a>, for example, or your mother\u2019s house in Oklahoma.  The fact that our flight even left SeaTac yesterday was, we decided, our Christmas miracle.  So I think I should keep this short today, and get back to appreciating that miracle by crawling under the covers in my old bed.<\/p>\n<p>But before I do that, I wanted to make sure that you had this Bundt cake recipe.  If you haven\u2019t yet had your Christmas miracle, well, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">ta daaa<\/span>!  Here it is.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/6049c-polaboozycake3-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/6049c-polaboozycake3-21.jpg?w=246\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5282411801308247346\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>I am not, under ordinary circumstances, a great fan of alcoholic desserts.  Many of them seem to involve Amaretto, and I just don\u2019t like it.  This admission makes me sound sort of boring and unfun, I know, as though I sit around on Saturday nights and read the<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> Oxford English Dictionary<\/span> with a magnifying glass, but I say it so that you will understand how special this particular alcoholic dessert is.  I am a great, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">great<\/span> fan of this Bundt cake, or boozy cake, as I like to call it.  You have to pronounce that as one word: not boozy cake, but boozycake.  Just so you know.<\/p>\n<p>The recipe comes from the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">New York Times<\/span>, from an article by Melissa Clark that ran about three weeks ago.  It\u2019s a riff on an old Maida Heatter recipe, a rich, dark chocolate cake punched up with not only a quarter-cup of instant espresso, but an entire cup, a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">cup<\/span>, ONE CUP, of whiskey.  It has a soft, moist, tightly woven crumb, and it makes the kitchen smell very sophisticated, like winter and warmth and the dinner parties my parents used to throw when I was little, after they put me to bed.  It smells very chocolatey and very boozy.   Because it <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">is<\/span> very boozy.  The night I made it, I cut a slice while it was still a bit warm, and eating it, standing over the kitchen counter, I actually felt a little woozy.  And no, I did not intend to make that rhyme.  Although once I saw it happening, I didn\u2019t exactly stop it, either.<\/p>\n<p>If you can, try to make this cake a day before you want to serve it, to allow the flavors to mellow and meld.  On the first day, the flavor of the alcohol threatens to drown out the chocolate, but after a little overnight rest, they reach a sort of compromise, complementing each other instead of competing, the deep darkness of the chocolate rising to meet the heady afterburn of the whiskey.  If you, like us, haven\u2019t trimmed your tree yet, this would be just the kind of thing for that, for eating with one hand while you hang ornaments with the other.  To add to the festive feeling, you could even turn on that old <a href=\"http:\/\/shop.mannheimsteamroller.com\/\">Mannheim Steamroller<\/a> Christmas album, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Christmas-Mannheim-Steamroller\/dp\/B0000005MT\/ref=pd_sim_m_1\">the one that came out in 1984<\/a> and that my family continues to trot out every single December.    If you eat enough boozy cake, the synthesizers might actually sound kind of nice.  Imagine that!  What a cake.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Whiskey-Soaked Dark Chocolate Bundt Cake<\/span><br \/>Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/12\/03\/dining\/031arex.html?ref=dining\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">The New York Times<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I used <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stgeorgespirits.com\/\">St. George<\/a> whiskey for this recipe, but next time, I think I would use bourbon.  Whatever you choose, be sure to use something that you like to drink on its own; its flavor is the real centerpiece here.<\/p>\n<p>2 sticks (8 oz.) unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the pan<br \/>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pan<br \/>5 oz. unsweetened chocolate<br \/>\u00bc cup instant espresso powder<br \/>2 Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder<br \/>1 cup bourbon, rye, or other whiskey, plus more for sprinkling<br \/>\u00bd tsp. kosher salt<br \/>2 cups granulated sugar<br \/>3 large eggs<br \/>1 Tbsp. vanilla extract<br \/>1 tsp. baking soda<br \/>Confectioners\u2019 sugar, for garnish (optional)<\/p>\n<p>Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F.  Grease and flour a 10-cup-capacity Bundt pan (or two 8- or 9-inch loaf pans).<\/p>\n<p>In a heatproof bowl set over \u2013 but not touching \u2013 a saucepan of simmering water, melt the chocolate until just smooth, stirring occasionally.  Let cool.<\/p>\n<p>Put espresso and cocoa powders in a 2-cup (or larger) glass measuring cup. Add enough boiling water to come up to the 1 cup measuring line.  Stir until the powders dissolve. Add the whiskey and salt.  Let cool.<\/p>\n<p>Using an electric mixer, beat the butter until fluffy. Add the sugar, and beat until well combined.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla extract, baking soda and melted chocolate, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.<\/p>\n<p>With the mixer on low speed, beat in a third of the whiskey mixture. When liquid is absorbed, beat in 1 cup flour. Repeat additions, ending with the whiskey mixture.  It may seem like there is too much liquid, but don\u2019t worry; it\u2019s okay.  Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, and smooth the top.  Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes for a Bundt pan. (Loaf pans will take less time; start checking them after 55 minutes.)<\/p>\n<p>Transfer the cake, still in its pan, to a rack. Unmold after 15 minutes and sprinkle warm cake with more whiskey.  (I did this by pouring a little bit into a teaspoon, and then shaking the teaspoon over the cake.  I\u2019m guessing that I used 3 teaspoons\u2019 worth in all.)  Cool completely before serving, garnished with confectioners\u2019 sugar, if you like.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Note<\/span>: This cake tastes even better on the second day, when the intensity of the alcohol mellows a little bit.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 10 to 12 servings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi, friends.
