When a customer steps up to his cart, the mini-cake man quietly springs into action, greasing the pan with a wooden-handled brush and filling it with a thin stream of the batter. He carefully closes the hinge and holds the pan over a propane flame, turning it a time or two to evenly brown the cakes. Then, scraping any excess batter from the rim, he turns the finished cakes into a bowl and delivers them to his waiting customer, <strong>still hot, in a little waxed-paper bag.<\/strong><br \/><strong><\/strong><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/NYC_September_2005_mini_cakes_in_bag.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/09\/NYC_September_2005_mini_cakes_in_bag.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>We stood on the corner and popped them one by one into our mouths, the two-tone cakes speckled with pin-sized holes and trimmed with lacy edges that flipped like tiny, soft skirts.

Though lacking the soft, famously elastic texture of Italy\u2019s classic gelatos, these New York-style offerings were enough to send us into small raptures on the street outside. The sorbet was dark with cocoa and<strong> impossibly smooth<\/strong>, without an ice crystal to be found\u2014an ideal match for the mint gelato, which tasted like spearmint leaves steeped in fresh, lightly sweetened cream. My milk chocolate gelato made some of the finest chocolate ice cream I\u2019ve ever eaten, and the strawberry was bright and true, finishing with a <strong>rush of rich cream<\/strong>.
