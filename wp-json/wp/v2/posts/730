Whoa.<\/p>\n<p>A week ago yesterday, I went to bed like I do every night. I read \u201cShouts &amp; Murmurs\u201d in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">New Yorker<\/span> and wondered, as usual, why it wasn\u2019t very funny. I set my glasses on top of the stack of books on my bedside table and then retrieved them when they fell, as usual, and slid behind the table. I felt pretty normal &#8211; which is to say, I didn\u2019t feel <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ab<\/span>normal. Until I woke up at 3:30 in the morning, feeling nauseous, and spent the next four days on the couch, trying to get down a glass of Gatorade. You know you\u2019re very sick when even a nature documentary about the deep oceans &#8211; a nature documentary narrated by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David_Attenborough\">Sir David Attenborough<\/a>, whom you adore, and whose <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pHyLdYIDAb0&amp;feature=channel\">voice<\/a> is a known soporific &#8211; feels like too much for your fragile senses. I was very sick. I have now returned to the land of the living, and that\u2019s all I want to say about that. Anyone for soup?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7a23d-polasoupabove-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5522485451503265858\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7a23d-polasoupabove-11.jpg?w=294\" alt=\"\" width=\"1205\" height=\"1231\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nA red lentil soup, namely, from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKitchen-Good-Appetite-Recipes-Stories%2Fdp%2F1401323766&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">a new cookbook<\/a> by Melissa Clark? It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been living on for three days now. Melissa Clark writes the terrific column \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/features\/diningandwine\/columns\/a_good_appetite\/index.html?scp=1-spot&amp;sq=a%20good%20appetite&amp;st=cse\">A Good Appetite<\/a>\u201d in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">New York Times<\/span>, and I\u2019ve never made a recipe of hers that I didn\u2019t like. She knows what\u2019s what. A version of this soup first ran <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/01\/09\/dining\/091arex.html?ref=dining\">in her column<\/a> almost three years ago, and I remember reading about it then, though it took me until this week to try it. I was looking for something soothing to eat, and her book was nearby, so I opened it to the table of contents, and right away, I saw it: Red Lentil Soup with Lemon. It looked reassuringly simple, without a lot of flash or spice &#8211; only cumin, black pepper, a little cayenne, lemon, and a restrained garnish of olive oil. And then I remembered that my friend <a href=\"http:\/\/thatswhatyouthink.wordpress.com\/\">Winnie<\/a> had mentioned that same recipe to me a few months ago, in the spring, after a long winter of making soup. She said that it was one of her standbys, that it got everything right, and that it called for a dab of tomato paste, a dab that was brilliant and made it sing. Now that I\u2019ve made it, I have to agree.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/1a6cd-polasoupside-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5522487993696491858\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/1a6cd-polasoupside-21.jpg?w=293\" alt=\"\" width=\"1207\" height=\"1235\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nI only wish I had thought to put chopped cilantro on top before I took this picture. I also wish I had not drizzled the olive oil in a shape reminiscent of a snake closing in on seven unsuspecting mice. At any rate, make this soup.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve made a lot of lentil soups &#8211; including one that will be in my column in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bonappetit.com\/magazine\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Bon App\u00e9tit<\/span><\/a> in December, so keep an eye out &#8211; but I\u2019ve never made a specimen quite like this. Most lentil soups fall into one of two categories: Highly Spiced, or Not Spiced (sometimes called Bland). This one sits happily in the middle. It manages to be both mellow and full of flavor. The cumin chips in nicely, and the lemon helps close the deal, but it\u2019s still a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">quiet<\/span> soup, delicate and refined, every note in its place. I can\u2019t say for sure how it works, but I think Winnie was right: tomato paste is the key. Clark ingeniously cooks it in with the onions and garlic, so it sizzles and intensifies and goes sweet-smelling, and though you can\u2019t pick out its flavor in the finished soup, it lends some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.umamiinfo.com\/what_exactly_is_umami?\/\">umami<\/a> to the mix. All told, it\u2019s the kind of thing you might want to pair with a few crackers and some aged cheddar, the type that crumbles when you slice it. It also screams for a beer. It says October.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Red Lentil Soup with Lemon<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\"> Adapted slightly from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKitchen-Good-Appetite-Recipes-Stories%2Fdp%2F1401323766&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">In the Kitchen with a Good Appetite<\/span><\/a>, by Melissa Clark<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2010-09-30T07:09:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/730?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>I had some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.penzeys.com\/cgi-bin\/penzeys\/p-penzeysaleppopepper.html\">Aleppo pepper<\/a> in the spice drawer, and I decided to use it in place of the cayenne. It\u2019s not as spicy, but it brings a lot of fragrance, and it was a good match for the flavors of this soup. So if you\u2019ve got it, use it.<\/p>\n<p>I should note, too, that I forgot to stir the cilantro into the soup, and instead I used it as a garnish. I liked the look of it, though I might try stirring it in next time, since that\u2019s what Melissa Clark intended.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            4 Tbsp. olive oil, plus additional good oil for drizzling\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 large yellow onions, chopped\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            4 garlic cloves, minced or pressed\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 Tbsp. tomato paste\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tsp. ground cumin\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd tsp. kosher salt, or more to taste\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            A few grinds of freshly ground black pepper\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Pinch of cayenne or Aleppo pepper, or more to taste\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 quarts chicken or vegetable broth\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 cups red lentils, picked through for stones and debris\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 large carrots, peeled and diced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Juice of 1 lemon, or more to taste\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1\/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>In a large pot, warm the oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering.

Add the broth, 2 cups water, the lentils, and the carrots. Bring to a simmer, then partially cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Continue to cook until the lentils are soft, about 30 minutes. Taste, and add more salt if necessary. Using an immersion or regular blender, puree about half of the soup. It should still be somewhat chunky, not completely smooth. Reheat if necessary, then stir in the lemon juice and cilantro. Serve the soup drizzled with good olive oil and dusted very lightly with cayenne, if desired.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 6 to 8 servings<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>That was not the week I planned to have.
