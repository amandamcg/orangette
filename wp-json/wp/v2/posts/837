That was not at all what I planned for the month of April.<br \/>\nSo long, April. So long, plans.<\/p>\n<p>I want to get this show back on the road. I\u2019ve missed being here, and I\u2019ve missed you. But before we go any further, I want to offer a long overdue thank you to those who came to my readings last month. I thought I had a great time on my first tour, but somehow, I had an even better time this year, despite the fact that I was dealing with a whopping case of laryngitis and could hardly speak. I hope you could hear me, and that you enjoyed it. It made me so happy to meet you. I\u2019ll be high on that well into next year, I think. Which is a good thing, because there won\u2019t be any more touring until I write another book, and writing books takes a while. I\u2019ll keep you posted.<\/p>\n<p>Also, I want to thank you for your very kind comments and e-mails about my grandmother. Nanny, as we called her, passed away on April 15. She\u2019d been slowly declining for a number of years, but the last two were particularly hard for her, and hard for us, and when she got a cold in early April, we knew she couldn\u2019t withstand it. It\u2019s never easy to lose someone, but in this case, to be honest, I\u2019m relieved. She was ready. She\u2019d wanted to go, and she was very vocal about that. If anything, I\u2019m sad that she had to go through so much discomfort, and wait so long, before she could get her wish. I\u2019m happy that she\u2019s free. She\u2019s with my grandfather now, her husband of almost fifty years, who passed away in 1992. I\u2019ll bet they\u2019re <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">elated<\/span>. Can you imagine? What a reunion.<\/p>\n<p>After she was gone, we had to clear out her apartment, which meant dividing up her belongings. I came home with a lot of photographs. Nanny was very good about writing dates and names and any relevant notes on the back of family photographs, but she wrote only \u201cFeb \u201851\u201d on this one. By the date, I\u2019m guessing that she\u2019s holding her youngest child. I love her hair. I can\u2019t imagine having a baby, plus six other young children running around, and having hair that good. I have only a dog, and a restaurant, if that counts, and my hair is a disaster.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/b6cc8-nannyandjody-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5466462005426455458\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/b6cc8-nannyandjody-11.jpg?w=201\" alt=\"\" width=\"645\" height=\"963\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>That aside, I also got to keep her recipe box.

I flipped through it and was thrilled to find a few dinner party and cocktail party menus among the recipes, jotted on slips of white paper. I can now tell you that on Sunday, December 30, 1984, she and my grandfather had guests in from 3 to 6 pm, and she served:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Smoked Turkey + Rolls<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Phyllis Dip<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Crudite + Spinach Dip<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Cookies<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Candies<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Chocolate Chip bread<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fruit cake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>She must have served a lot of fruit cake, because I found it listed on other menus, too. I had no idea she was so into fruit cake. I also found the following recipe in the appetizers section, and I have to type it up for you exactly as it was written, because it would be a shame not to share the wealth:<\/p>\n<p><u style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nibbler<\/u><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Bowl of peanuts + raisins<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Mixed<\/span><\/p>\n<p>I love Nibbler.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/3be74-polacinntoastspectra-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5466130258955493234\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/3be74-polacinntoastspectra-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1090\" height=\"880\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>But most crucial for our purposes, I found a recipe for something called Cinnamon Toast. I know you\u2019re sitting there like, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Riiiight. Cinnamon toast. Tell me something I <\/span>haven\u2019t<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> heard<\/span>, but bear with me, because this is different. It\u2019s not bread that you toast and then butter and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. It\u2019s bread that you cut into triangles, generously coat on both sides with melted butter, dredge in cinnamon sugar, and then bake until crisp. You can keep them in a tin on the counter, where they actually get better with a day or two of age, and you eat them like cookies. I don\u2019t know where the recipe originally came from, but it was written in what I think is my aunt Millicent\u2019s handwriting. My mother tells me that she also has it, and that she\u2019s had it for years. She used to make it all the time, she says, particularly when she was having a morning meeting and wanted something to serve with coffee. I don\u2019t remember ever eating it, and to be frank, I sort of had a hard time believing it could be worth a real, written recipe. I mean, it\u2019s CINNAMON TOAST. But I tried it yesterday, and I was wrong. Nanny, Mom, Millicent, I was wrong. I was so wrong. Next, I\u2019m making Nibbler.<\/p>\n<p>You should try this recipe. I\u2019ve never had anything quite like it. The premise is simple, and so are the ingredients, but it sort of defies categorization. The bread gets crisp and crunchy, and the butter gives it some richness, and the cinnamon sugar caramelizes lightly, going almost lacy at the edges. My mother says it\u2019s \u201clike cinnamon candy,\u201d but to me, the overall experience is closer to a snickerdoodle cookie. Only easier, and faster, and crunchier. Which is to say, I like it even better.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Cinnamon Toasts<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from my grandmother Elaine Mack<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2010-05-02T06:13:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/837?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>This recipe in its original form calls for dipping the bread in butter. On both sides. I tried it, and the bread got so saturated that it sort of terrified me. There was a LOT of butter in that little piece of bread. I found that brushing on the butter is a more moderate, palatable approach, and it still works very well. Either way, you\u2019re going to use quite a bit of butter, and please don\u2019t freak out about that. If it helps, keep reminding yourself that this is not breakfast; this is a cookie. Make it your mantra.<\/p>\n<p>Also, the original version of the recipe calls specifically for Pepperidge Farm white bread. My grocery store didn\u2019t have any, so I used Franz brand \u201cMilk and Honey\u201d bread instead. Whatever brand you use, make sure that it\u2019s not too squishy and spongy. The quantities of butter and cinnamon sugar listed below should be pretty close to perfect for six slices of sandwich bread, but if you have extra butter or sugar, just use more bread.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 stick (4 oz.) unsalted butter, cubed\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            6 slices white sandwich bread, or more as needed\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd cup sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tsp. ground cinnamon          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F. If you want, line a baking sheet with parchment or aluminum foil. It makes cleanup easier.<\/p>\n<p>Put the butter into a pie plate or similar baking dish. Slide the dish into the oven, and keep an eye on it. You\u2019re looking for the butter to melt completely.<\/p>\n<p>Stack the slices of bread, and then cut them diagonally into quarters. You should have 24 triangles.<\/p>\n<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar and cinnamon. Turn the cinnamon sugar out onto a dinner plate, or another pie plate.<\/p>\n<p>When the butter is melted, remove it from the oven, and brush it onto both sides of a triangle of bread. Don\u2019t be shy: apply the butter generously, so no spot is left uncoated. The bread should feel a little heavy in your hand. Dip the bread into the cinnamon sugar, taking care to coat both sides. Lay it on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining pieces of bread.<\/p>\n<p>Bake the toasts for about 25 minutes, until lightly browned. Transfer to a rack. The toasts will crisp as they cool. When cooled, store in an airtight container at room temperature.<\/p>\n<p>Note: These taste best with a little age. When I tasted them on the day they were made, they were just okay, but by the next day, the flavors had come together nicely.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 24 pieces<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Well.
