Kind of wishy-washy, I guess you could say.  Not that I\u2019m complaining or anything.  No sir.  I\u2019m just saying.  We\u2019ve had the usual load of rain and even a scant dusting of snow, but everywhere, all around, the shrubs are sending out little green buds. Yesterday it was sunny and 50 degrees, and we went to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityofseattle.net\/parks\/Environment\/discovparkindex.htm\">Discovery Park<\/a> in nothing but jeans and t-shirts &#8211; long-sleeved, but still &#8211; and collected shells on the beach.  We even saw a plum tree with a few open blossoms(!).  I grinned so hard that I thought my face might crack open.  Then, when we came home, I made lemonade.  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Lemonade<\/span>!  And spiked it with vodka!  And <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">then<\/span>, while Brandon was out running his favorite thrift-shop circuit, I lip-synced to \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FfW46MZ6mb8\">Hungry Like the Wolf<\/a>\u201d about 85 times.  It was <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">such<\/span> a good day.  Like spring, really.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/af1e2-lemonade023-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/af1e2-lemonade023-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5155459853819510066\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Global warming, is that you?

I\u2019ve got a big glass of boozyade for you.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/aebd3-lemonade028-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/aebd3-lemonade028-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5155525725732928882\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Of course, today it\u2019s raining proverbial cats and dogs.  As I type this, a man is cowering his way down the street outside my window, dodging raindrops.  Best not to get my hopes up, I guess.  We\u2019ve got a while to go before spring.<\/p>\n<p>At least we have parsley.  That\u2019s all I can say.  Our little herb-and-arugula garden beside the house has pretty much gone kaput, but the Italian parsley, it lives on.  It\u2019s going gangbusters, actually.  It\u2019s nearly three feet tall and almost as bushy as my father\u2019s beard in an old photo I have in the basement, taken in the mid-\u201860s, during what I like to call his \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.argentour.com\/images\/che_guevara_fidel_castro.jpg\">Cuban revolutionary<\/a>\u201d facial hair phase.  It may be the middle of winter, but by god, we still have parsley.  Which means we can make pesto.  Or a variation on pesto, at least.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/76393-lemonade053-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/76393-lemonade053-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5155460047093038418\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>In fact, that\u2019s what I did last night with our friend <a href=\"http:\/\/olaiyalandcatering.com\/\">Olaiya<\/a>.  We wanted something to dollop on top of a bowl of parsnip soup, and parsley sounded like just the thing, whirred to a slurry in the food processor with a little oil and salt.  For added interest, we threw in a small palmful of almonds &#8211; Olaiya\u2019s inspired suggestion; I really can\u2019t take credit &#8211; and a squeeze of lemon, and before we knew it, the slurry had morphed into a pesto of sorts, earthy and salty and herbal and addictive.  (Isn\u2019t that the definition of a good pesto: addictive?  I certainly think so.)  It was unexpectedly lovely, more delicate than I could have imagined.  I liked it atop the soup &#8211; which, to tell you the truth, didn\u2019t turn out all that well &#8211; but I <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">loved<\/span> it today, when I made a second batch to stir into a pot of hot fettucine.  It went down like a charm.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/37d7a-lemonade059-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/37d7a-lemonade059-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5155460051388005730\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Now, I\u2019m not going to go telling you that Italian parsley is the new basil, or whatever, because heaven knows they\u2019re entirely different animals. But this wintry \u201cpesto\u201d is a lovely thing in its own right &#8211; grassy, fragrant, nubbly with sweet almonds.  I\u2019d be happy to eat it any number of ways, even straight off my fingertip.  And until spring rolls around, I intend to.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><br \/>Winter \u201cPesto\u201d with Parsley and Almonds<\/span><\/p>\n<p>You should think of this recipe as a mere starting point.  For instance, you can use raw almonds or toasted ones. (I use raw.) You can add garlic, or you can leave it out. (I like it without, but Brandon is pretty pro-garlic.)  You could try adding other herbs, or take it in another direction with capers or even anchovies.   Just be sure that, when it comes to the parsley, you use the Italian (flat-leaf) kind. Curly parsley doesn\u2019t have as much flavor.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and this recipe doubles nicely.<\/p>\n<p>2 Tbsp. whole almonds<br \/>1 packed cup Italian parsley leaves<br \/>4 &#8211; 6 Tbsp. olive oil<br \/>1 tsp. fresh lemon juice<br \/>\u00bc tsp. salt<br \/>1 small garlic clove, pressed (optional)<\/p>\n<p>In a small food processor, pulse the almonds until finely ground.  They don\u2019t need to be quite as fine as, say, sand, but close.  Add the parsley, 4 tablespoons of the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and garlic (if using), and process to a paste.  Taste and, if needed, adjust salt, lemon juice, and\/or olive oil.  I like to add an additional tablespoon or two of olive oil, just to boost the flavor.<\/p>\n<p>Serve over pasta (with grated Parmigiano Reggiano), alongside chicken or fish, or spooned atop roasted eggplant or mushrooms or boiled potatoes.  Wherever, really.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: about \u00bd cup<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don\u2019t know how it is where you are, but around here, winter has been a little weird.
