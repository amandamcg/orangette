I\u2019d been commissioned to help with the food, and I happily accepted.<\/p>\n<p>I arrived in mid-afternoon to find the house awash in pink, the official color of breast cancer awareness. There were pink balloons in the foyer and vases full of <strong>pink tulips on every available surface<\/strong>, and pink cr\u00eape paper was spun from the beams and light fixtures. They&#8217;d thought of everything, even making a centerpiece for the dining room table out of a bowl filled with shapely plaster breasts, leftover props from one of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.margotknight.com\/margot.html\">Margot<\/a>&#8216;s photo shoots. Now <em>this <\/em>would be a party.<\/p>\n<p>After a brief tour of the family collection of chef\u2019s toques,<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Margot%2C%20Linda%2C%20Kate_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/02\/Margot%2C-Linda%2C-Kate_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Kate set to work on another batch of choux, while I whipped up a triple recipe of my trademark vinaigrette to coat the mixed baby greens in Linda\u2019s enormous, drum-like wooden bowl. We diced avocados, squeezed limes, and cubed mangoes for salsa, while Margot\u2014recovering from shoulder surgery and out of commission, cooking-wise\u2014did her part to help by eating every mango scrap we left behind, <strong>sucking on the wide, flat seeds so as not to lose a shred of the musky flesh<\/strong>. I parboiled new potatoes and tossed them with apple cider vinegar, olive oil, sea salt, and rosemary from the garden, and then we piled them into a wide cazuela and slid them into the oven to finish. And Margot&#8217;s boyfriend <strong>Todd, showing his impressive cycling form, whipped the cream\u2014tinted pink, of course\u2014while riding with Lance and the U.S. Postal Service team<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Todd%20riding%20with%20cream%20adjusted_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/02\/Todd-riding-with-cream-adjusted_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Linda disappeared into the back of the house and reemerged resplendent in a fuzzy pink sweater, black flood pants, and pink pantyhose. Kate, seeing that my outfit lacked the evening\u2019s theme color (my dusty-purplish Peter Pan boots barely missed the mark), offered a hot-pink flower hair-clip which, she told me, had been purchased at a shop for strippers in San Francisco. Though infinitely more modest than the dining room centerpiece, the girly flower clip seemed to beg for platinum ringlets and a naughty hula get-up. I tried to do it justice.<\/p>\n<p>And then, before we knew it, the guests were arriving. Kate played bartender while we fielded the onslaught of flowers for Linda, among them a bouquet of baby roses tightly gathered and strategically colored to resemble a breast. The guests orbited the kitchen table and its generous spread: baked brie with honey, pecans, and sliced Granny Smith apples; plain brie with water crackers; and <strong>Linda\u2019s delicious (but unphotogenic) bagnette<\/strong> with grilled bread. The <strong>undisputed hit of the evening,<\/strong> it<strong> <\/strong>was a complex and piquant mixture of diced saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, parsley, tomato, red wine vinegar, olive oil, and loads of garlic.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Bagnette%20adjusted_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/02\/Bagnette-adjusted_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>While the guests sipped wine and talked, Todd and Kate&#8217;s father Jo monitored the salmon on the grill, and Kate quickly stir-fried snow peas with olive oil, garlic, and slivers of fresh ginger. Then we gently coaxed the guests away from the hors d\u2019oeuvres and through the buffet line on Jo&#8217;s handmade wooden countertop and, plates in hand, dispersed ourselves throughout the house to eat.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Dinner%20plate_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/02\/Dinner-plate_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>And then, of course, there were the cream puffs.

I was minding my own business, wearing that misleadingly dainty flower and scooping spoonfuls of soft pink cream into Kate\u2019s airy, eggy-smelling puffs, when I quite nearly came to blows with Jo. Apparently, I was being too sparing with the cream, despite the fact that my finished puffs were <strong>overflowing\u2014nay, <em>exploding<\/em><\/strong>\u2014with the stuff. I let him have his way and console himself with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.surlatable.com\/common\/products\/product_details.cfm?StartRow=10&amp;PRRFNBR=5688\">whipped cream siphon<\/a> and a tray of puffs, but we all knew better: mine were prettier. And anyway, with the first bite, they easily passed <strong>the ooze test<\/strong>. I ate three, just to make sure.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Puff%20close-up%20closest%2C%20adjusted_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/02\/Puff-close-up-closest%2C-adjusted_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Congratulations, Linda.<br \/>I can think of no better cause for celebration*\u2014or for eating loads of whipped cream.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">*<em>Update: <\/em>Linda tells me that over the course of the evening, she collected <strong>nearly $2,000(!) in donations <\/strong>for the University of Washington Foundation&#8217;s Breast Cancer Fund.
