I took her as my date to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewednesdaychef.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">friend<\/a>\u2019s wedding, a wedding to beat all weddings, where the groom\u2019s father played air guitar and I got to watch my mother, my near-retirement-age mother, break it down to \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0UjsXo9l6I8\" target=\"_blank\">Empire State of Mind<\/a>.\u201d I\u2019m still coming down from that. I shot eight rolls of film in nine days. When I have pictures, I promise to tell you about it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/9f5ca-519700311.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5625943911636296114\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/9f5ca-519700311.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1090\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, I wanted to share some great things I\u2019ve found lately. I really love gathering these for you, all the bits that stick in my head. Maybe they will stick in yours.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; My mom and I rented a car and drove about 1200 miles over the course of our trip. In the hopes that we would have a CD player, I burned a couple of albums before we left, and the one we listened to most often was Neko Case\u2019s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Middle Cyclone<\/span>. It\u2019s been out for about two years, but it took me a long time to fall for it. Now it\u2019s thoroughly won me over. Especially the eighth track, \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oBCleldMTjA\" target=\"_blank\">Fever<\/a>.\u201d The lyrics are sinister, but the sound feels so&#8230; sexy. Not that I make a habit of listening to sexy music with my mother. In any case, from now on, I think that album will always remind me of our trip, and I like that.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I always love Tommy\u2019s blog <a href=\"http:\/\/thisisnaive.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">This is Naive<\/a>, but she\u2019s really been pushing the right buttons for me lately. I especially like <a href=\"http:\/\/thisisnaive.com\/?p=7165\" target=\"_blank\">this post<\/a>. I love the way she sees.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Brian\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/bferry.wordpress.com\/2011\/07\/01\/midsummer-music\/\" target=\"_blank\">midsummer mix<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/tbsc.bizhosting.com\/bar_soap_3.html\" target=\"_blank\">Soap<\/a> from Townsend Bay Soap Company, in nearby Port Townsend, Washington. Apparently, I am really into soap. I particularly like the Townsend Bay Rum scent, and the Woods of Washington scent, too. Both smell like summer vacation. Different versions of summer vacation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/politicsoftheplate.com\/?page_id=2\" target=\"_blank\">Barry Estabrook<\/a> is a national treasure. His investigative <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gilttaste.com\/stories\/572-the-indignity-of-industrial-tomatoes\" target=\"_blank\">reporting on industrial tomato farming<\/a> is eye-opening, horrifying, and very, very important.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; On the other hand, and not even remotely important: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1CJ4SD-kWek&amp;feature=share\" target=\"_blank\">Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s Total Body Workout<\/a>!
