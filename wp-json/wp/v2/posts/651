Because I have another one for you. Yes, already. I\u2019m going to try to limit it to one a month from now on, but what can you do? I woke up the other morning, realized I had the ingredients for a batch of oatmeal popovers, and the next thing I knew, they were made.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e7311-5383313035_ddafc51cfe_o1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5565645633865786514\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e7311-5383313035_ddafc51cfe_o1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1130\" height=\"873\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nAs with last week\u2019s fresh ginger muffins, this recipe &#8211; or at least the ingredients part of it &#8211; comes to us from Ms. Marion Cunningham and <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreakfast-Book-Marion-Cunningham%2Fdp%2F0394555295%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1295145208%26sr%3D8-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">The Breakfast Book<\/a><\/i>. It\u2019s a very subtle riff on a classic popover, one that includes a fistful of rolled oats that you\u2019ve coarsely ground in the food processor. Her headnotes explain that she uses the oatmeal for additional texture, and I can attest that the result is really lovely: a little heartier, a scant degree more substantial, than an ordinary popover. But I would add that the oats bring some flavor too, which I like very much. It\u2019s a quiet flavor, one you only notice if you look for it, but it\u2019s there. Ordinary popovers can sometimes taste too eggy, but the oats counter that, giving the flavor some depth and grounding. It felt fiddly to haul out the food processor first thing in the morning, before I\u2019d even put on real clothes, but I was glad I did. Actually, I might grind extra oats next time, so they\u2019re ready whenever I want them.<\/p>\n<p>I have to admit, though, that I did make some adjustments to the method. Ms. Cunningham starts her popovers in a cold oven, but that sort of terrifies me. I have an electric oven, and the only time that I tried the cold-oven popover method, the lower heating element scorched my popovers in the process of preheating. I am not a nice person when my breakfast gets ruined. Maybe it was a fluke, but I don\u2019t use the cold-oven popover method anymore. I start my popovers in a hot oven, and I also preheat the pan before I pour in the batter, which gives them an extra boost. The method that I like best is detailed nicely in the book <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNew-Best-Recipe-All-New%2Fdp%2F0936184744&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">The New Best Recipe<\/a><\/i>, and so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve written below. Basically, you get Marion Cunningham\u2019s concept and ingredients, with <i>The New Best Recipe<\/i>\u2019s method. I hope she\u2019ll forgive me for taking such liberties.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Oatmeal Popovers<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreakfast-Book-Marion-Cunningham%2Fdp%2F0394555295%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1295145208%26sr%3D8-1&tag=orangette-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325\">The Breakfast Book<\/a><\/i> and <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNew-Best-Recipe-All-New%2Fdp%2F0936184744&tag=orangette-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325\">The New Best Recipe<\/a><\/i><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2011-01-24T08:20:00-05:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/651?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>I\u2019ve made these popovers twice now, and I find that they don\u2019t rise quite as exuberantly high as normal (oatmeal-less) popovers.

Whisk the flour, oats, and salt in a separate bowl, and add to the egg mixture. Stir with a wooden spoon or spatula just until the flour is incorporated. The mixture will still be lumpy. Add the melted butter, and whisk until the batter is smooth, about 30 seconds. Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes. (This gives the gluten time to relax and brings the chilled ingredients closer to room temperature, so that the batter isn\u2019t quite so cold when it goes into the oven.)<\/p>\n<p><i>Note<\/i>: If you don\u2019t have a popover pan, you can use a regular muffin tin. Don\u2019t use all 12 cups, though; use only the 10 outer cups. You\u2019ll need extra oil to grease them.<\/p>\n<p>While the batter rests, put \u00bd teaspoon oil into each cup of a popover pan. Adjust the oven rack to the lowest position, place the popover pan in the oven, and preheat to 450\u00b0 F. After the batter has rested, remove the hot pan from the oven and, working quickly, distribute the batter evenly among the 6 cups of the pan. (If your bowl doesn\u2019t have a spout, you might want to transfer it to a vessel that does; it\u2019ll allow you to work much more quickly.) Return the pan to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes &#8211; and DO NOT open the oven door. Lower the heat to 350\u00b0 F, and bake until evenly golden brown, about 15 minutes more. Remove the popovers from the pan and cool for 2 to 3 minutes before eating.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 6 popovers<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Well.
