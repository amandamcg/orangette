I figured you\u2019re probably all Christmas-baking-ed out, or maybe you already have a spiced nut recipe that you like, or, I don\u2019t know, who really eats spiced nuts? This admission will no doubt mark me as an empty, soulless person, but I always thought of spiced nuts as the kind of holiday gift you don\u2019t actually eat. \u00a0Right? No? You admire the packaging, and you\u2019re touched that someone gave them to you, but you never actually feel moved to eat them? \u00a0I only made this recipe because I did my holiday baking this year with my niece Hillary, and she suggested it. Hillary is an excellent cook and eater, and I knew she wouldn\u2019t lead me astray. So we made a double batch, and a week later, my half has been entirely eaten. From now on, I defer to Hillary.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/07a9e-9f7a03121.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/07a9e-9f7a03121.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Of course, because I didn\u2019t plan to write about them, I only thought to photograph the nuts once they were almost gone, at a moment when I was eating a fistful of them out of a plastic storage container while standing next to the sink piled with dirty dishes, drinking an afternoon cup of PG Tips. Still, I hope you get the idea: they\u2019re toasty and crunchy, coated with a crackly layer of caramelized sugar and spices and just enough salt to land them on the savory side of the fence, and though they\u2019re intended to be eaten with a cocktail, they go with anything. PG Tips. Plain water. Boozed-up egg nog. Saliva. Between me and Ben &#8211; I\u2019m not sure Brandon even got to taste them &#8211; we ate so much that I could only give them to a couple of friends before they disappeared.<\/p>\n<p>The recipe comes from the bar at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gramercytavern.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Gramercy Tavern<\/a>. Hillary lived in New York until recently, and she had eaten them there and remembered how good they were. So she dug up the recipe <a href=\"http:\/\/www.panachemag.com\/Food&amp;Wine\/MIXSHAKESTIR.asp\" target=\"_blank\">online<\/a>, and between my spice drawer and a trip to the store for nuts, we pulled together the ingredients. \u00a0The nuts are easy to make: you stir together sugar, salt, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, ginger, black pepper, and nutmeg, and then you stir that mixture into a bowl of almonds, pecans, and cashews, along with a little simple syrup, a little oil, and the smallest amount of corn syrup. (Not to be confused with high-fructose corn syrup &#8211; though if you don\u2019t want to use corn syrup at all, I\u2019ll bet honey would be a fine substitute.) If you taste the spiced nuts in their raw state, you will probably not be pleased: they are <i>much<\/i>\u00a0spicier before you bake them than after. (And if anyone can explain why that is so, I would be grateful.) They are\u00a0<i>spicy<\/i>(!!!) spiced nuts. But once the spices toast and meld with the sugar and the mixture turns to caramel, the heat fades to a humming warmth, and the sugar and salt strike an amicable balance, and then, boom, they\u2019re gone.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Gramercy Tavern Bar Nuts<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from\u00a0<i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0316045128\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316045128&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Mix Shake Stir<\/a><\/i>, by Danny Meyer<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2013-12-20T04:35:00-05:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/230?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>This recipe uses two different kinds of salt. I don\u2019t know why, although I\u2019m guessing that the different salts coat the nuts differently? In any case, my kosher salt is Diamond Crystal brand, and that\u2019s important to note, because it\u2019s significantly less salty than Morton brand kosher salt. If you have Morton (or another brand), you\u2019ll want to use much less than the 1 tablespoon this recipe calls for. I\u2019d suggest about 1 \u00bd teaspoons.<\/p>\n<p>Also, to make simple syrup, combine equal parts sugar and water in a small saucepan, bring to a simmer, stir until the sugar dissolves, and then take it off the heat and allow it to cool. \u00a0(To be honest, though, I didn\u2019t allow mine to cool; I made it just before using and only cooled it for a few minutes.)<\/p>\n<p>Last, the original version of this recipe uses volume measurements, and I forgot to convert them to weight measurements when I made it. \u00a0I know, I know; I usually give you both types of measurements, and I, myself, prefer weight. I am sad.

Add the spice mix, and toss gently until the nuts are evenly coated. \u00a0Spread on the prepared baking sheet. \u00a0Bake until the spice mixture is caramelized and the nuts are toasted, about 25-40 minutes. To check for doneness, take a few nuts out of the oven and let cool for a few minutes; if done, they should be dry to the touch.<\/p>\n<p>Cool completely; then store in an airtight container. (The original recipe says that the nuts should keep at room temperature for a week, but I\u2019d guess that they\u2019ll keep longer than that. \u00a0Two weeks, easy.)<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: about 4 cups<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our friend Ben was here last week.
