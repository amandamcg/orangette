First, you zizz some Greek yogurt, olive oil, peas, and garlic in a food processor until the mixture is an even shade of pale green. Then you heat a pot of water and boil some pasta in it, and while that\u2019s going, you warm some pine nuts and chile flakes in a skillet filmed with olive oil until the nuts are golden and the oil is red, and you also heat some more peas in a little bowl of water scooped from the pasta pot. \u00a0When the pasta is ready, you drain it and fold it together with the yogurt sauce, the now-warm peas, some torn basil leaves, and some crumbled feta. \u00a0The hot pasta heats and loosens the sauce, and the overall effect is creamy but not heavy in the least, bright where you hit a basil leaf or a pea, salty where you hit a lump of feta. You scoop it into a bowl, spoon over some pine nuts and the chile oil, which brings that kind of low, creeping heat that makes your lips tingle, and as I scraped my bowl and went back to the kitchen for seconds, I decided it was the best thing I\u2019ve made in a long, long time. (The best savory thing, I should clarify. Nothing compares to cake.

If not, you can use regular red pepper flakes. I happened to have some Aleppo chile, and though it was ground, not in flakes, and probably a few years old, it worked beautifully. Oh, and if you\u2019re worried about the amount of heat, consider starting with a little less of the chile than what is called for &#8211; or just don\u2019t put much chile oil on your pasta.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 \u00bd cups (500 g) whole-milk Greek yogurt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2\/3 cup (150 ml) olive oil\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 medium cloves garlic, crushed or pressed\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 pound (500 g) fresh or thawed frozen peas\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Kosher salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 pound (500 g) pasta shapes of your liking\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Scant\u00a0\u00bd cup (60 g) pine nuts\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 teaspoons Turkish or Syrian chile flakes, or red pepper flakes\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 2\/3 cups (40 g) basil leaves, coarsely torn\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            8 ounces (240 g) feta cheese, coarsely crumbled          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>In the bowl of a food processor, combine the yogurt, 6 tablespoons (90 ml) of the olive oil, the garlic, and 2\/3 cup (100 g) of the peas.

Add the pasta, and cook until it is al dente. While the pasta cooks, warm the remaining olive oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Add the pine nuts and chile flakes, and cook for 4 minutes, or until the pine nuts are golden and the oil is deep red. Also, warm the remaining peas in some boiling water (you could scoop out a bit of the pasta water for this); then drain.<\/p>\n<p>Drain the cooked pasta into a colander, and shake it well to get rid of excess water that may have settled into the pasta\u2019s crevices. Add the pasta gradually to the yogurt sauce; adding it all at once may cause the yogurt to separate. Add the warm peas, the basil, feta, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Toss gently. Serve immediately, with pine nuts and chile oil spooned over each serving.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 6 servings<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every so often, I encounter a recipe that makes me want to forgo the usual niceties of a post &#8211; the introduction, the story, the conclusion, the delicate foreplay\u00a0&#8211;\u00a0because that would only slow you down, when what you should really do is grab your shoes and make a list and run to the grocery store and throw some money at the cashier and run back home and make this immediately and I mean it, go,\u00a0right now, DO IT.
