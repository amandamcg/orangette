[We didn\u2019t plan it this way, I <em>promise<\/em>.] I\u2019m pretty bad with birthdays, I guess. But this dish, which we had whipped up the night before, seems as fitting and celebratory a birthday offering as any, especially for a late-July baby.<\/p>\n<p>For those of us in the Pacific Northwest, where blackberry bushes are standard-issue backyard shrubs and common roadside attractions, it\u2019s high berry season. Nearly everywhere you look, there\u2019s a little cluster of purply-black orbs just waiting to be picked. The berries for this dish came from our own backyard, in fact, and from a bush that we only noticed a week or so ago. [Suffice it to say that it will never go unnoticed again!] It\u2019s a classic berries-and-cream number, but better, because the cream has been whipped and sweetened\u2014and then <em>br\u00fbl\u00e9ed<\/em>. Served heaped in a single bowl, family-style, it looks like a series of soft little mountain peaks\u2014baby Mount Rainiers, maybe\u2014capped with caramelized sugar instead of snow. Cool and lightly sweet, airy and rich, it\u2019s one of the few things that\u2019s better than a plain blackberry eaten straight from the bush. It\u2019s eminently worthy of a birthday.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Blackberry_brulee.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/08\/Blackberry_brulee.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>1 cup heavy cream<br \/>6 Tbs superfine sugar<br \/>3 \u2013 3 \u00bd cups fresh blackberries, gently rinsed and dried on paper towels<br \/>2-3 Tbs <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B0006GSXPC\/qid=1154148600\/sr=1-7\/ref=sr_1_7\/103-3572326-3598268?_encoding=UTF8&amp;n=3580501&amp;s=gourmet-food&amp;v=glance\">demerara<\/a> or other raw cane sugar<\/p>\n<p>In a large bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer), whip the cream until stiff peaks form.

Liberally sprinkle the top with demerara sugar. Using a kitchen torch, evenly caramelize the sugar until it turns bubbly and golden brown in some spots. [Pay no attention to the color or evenness of the br\u00fbl\u00e9ed spots in the photo above. Our torch started to run out of fuel, so our br\u00fbl\u00e9ing job was pretty weak.] The cream will melt and run a bit under the flame, but don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s good.<\/p>\n<p>Place the br\u00fbl\u00e9e in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes to let the sugar harden slightly. Serve immediately.<\/p>\n<p><em>Yield:<\/em> 4-6 servings<\/p>\n<p><em>Note:<\/em> If you find yourself blessed with leftovers, as we did, try sticking the stuff in the freezer. We spooned it into a Tupperware container, pressed a bit of plastic wrap against the surface to keep it from getting icy, put on the lid, and froze it. It doesn\u2019t get smooth like a churned ice cream, but it\u2019s crisp and airy and refreshing. Brandon says that he\u2014<em>gasp!\u2014<\/em>almost likes it better this way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hooooo boy. I just don\u2019t know where the time goes.
