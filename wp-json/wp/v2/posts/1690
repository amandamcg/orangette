Clearly, I could use <strong>a good mood-enhancer, and short of a full day of sunlight, a cake\u2014or eight\u2014will do<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The holidays may have been a two-week parade of excess, but no amount of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/01\/tender-is-cabbage.html\">food fatigue<\/a> can keep me from dessert. Anyway, for all its caloric riches, Christmas offers little in the cake department, a deficiency that has not been lost on my sweet tooth. No holiday cookie, candy, tart, pudding, or pie can replicate <strong>the gustatory experience of a good piece of cake\u2014moist but crumbly, dense but spongy, simple but profoundly satisfying<\/strong>. And to boot, cake is uniquely well-suited to sopping up nearly anything: tea, coffee, port, or, if it strikes your fancy and your city, precipitation. I feel only justified, then, in availing myself of a stash of sugar, butter, and almonds and remedying the situation with a few dainty grape-freckled almond cakes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Almond_cakes_one_more.0.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/01\/Almond_cakes_one_more.0.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Coarse-crumbed, delicate, and tender to the tooth, these cakes make up in richness what they lack in size. Subtly sweet but unabashedly buttery, they emerge from the oven like <strong>little lumps of gold, palm-sized and promising<\/strong>. With crisp edges and a moist, melting center, they take kindly to a good dunking in something wet, warm, and soothing, and even, maybe, to a deluge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Red-Grape-and-Almond Butter Cakes<\/strong><br \/>Inspired by <em>Gourmet<\/em>, October 2003<\/p>\n<p>These cakes are a homey riff on the French <em>financier<\/em>, a small butter- and almond-rich cake baked in a rectangular mold. <em>Gourmet<\/em>\u2019s version of this recipe called for baking these cakes in and eating them from 4 small, shallow gratin dishes, but I wanted something even smaller, something able to be eaten out of hand or nestled into the lip of a saucer, next to a teacup. I suppose I could have gone traditional and used <em>financier<\/em> molds, but because I don\u2019t have any, I reached for the muffin tin. The method here yields 8 round cakes, perfect for an afternoon snack or light dessert, dunked in tea, coffee, or plain steamed milk, or maybe with a glass of ruby or vintage port. For variety, try using different seasonal fruits: wedges of ripe plum or apricot, for example, will be on my list for next summer.<\/p>\n<p>\u00be cup whole blanched almonds<br \/>\u00bd cup granulated sugar<br \/>1 stick (\u00bd cup) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br \/>\u00be tsp pure vanilla extract<br \/>2 large eggs<br \/>1\/3 cup unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>1\/8 tsp salt<br \/>A handful of seedless red or black grapes, halved<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, and set a rack to the middle position. Butter or spray 8 wells of a 12-well \u00bd-cup muffin tin.<\/p>\n<p>In the bowl of a food processor, pulse half of the almonds with 1 Tbs of the sugar until very finely ground and powdery. Transfer the ground almonds to a small bowl, and repeat with the remaining almonds and 1 more Tbs of the sugar.<\/p>\n<p>In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter and remaining 6 Tbs sugar with an electric mixer set to high speed. When the butter and sugar mixture is fluffy and pale yellow, beat in the vanilla. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Reduce the mixer speed to low, and beat in the ground almonds, flour, and salt, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.<\/p>\n<p>Divide the batter evenly among the 8 prepared muffin wells. Press the halved grapes lightly into the batter, distributing them evenly among the 8 cakes. Slide the pan into the oven, and bake the cakes until they are firm and pale golden with slightly darker edges, about 15-20 minutes. If the cakes appear to be browning too quickly at the edges, tent the pan lightly with a sheet of aluminum foil.<\/p>\n<p>Cool the cakes for 10 minutes in the pan; then remove them to a rack to continue cooling. Serve warm or at room temperature.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 8 miniature cakes<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to Seattle\u2019s infamously rainy weather, I\u2019m usually pretty nonchalant.
