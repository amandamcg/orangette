How convenient that some flours are fortified with vitamin C; that way, we won\u2019t get scurvy. Modern pioneer life is something indeed.<\/p>\n<p>This tale begins October 29, 2004 with <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/10\/like-leaves_03.html\">Margot\u2019s sourdough starter<\/a>, which for weeks I\u2019d been lovingly stirring, feeding, sniffing, and stroking. Being of the \u201canything with wheat must be tastier and is of course infinitely more nutritious\u201d school, I chose as my first project a simple whole wheat bread from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vintagecookbook.com\/c082.html\"><em>Sourdough Jack\u2019s Cookery<\/em><\/a>. For brevity\u2019s sake, I summarize: all went well until I moved the three loaves from their nice warm rising spot into the oven, whereupon <strong>they collapsed and withered<\/strong>. I&#8217;d asked my sourdough to work harder than it was prepared to. The resulting loaves, while a lovely shade of gold, were rather diminutive, measuring between two and three inches tall. This disappointing fact, however, did not stop me from consuming a third of one loaf immediately. The rest was quite passable when toasted, especially when lacquered with a bit of this summer\u2019s strawberry jam. I made do. After years on the frontier, I\u2019m used to disappointment.<\/p>\n<p>Undaunted by the previous weekend\u2019s mediocre showing, I set out on November 6 with <a href=\"http:\/\/forums.egullet.org\/index.php?showtopic=27634\">Jack Lang\u2019s excellent tutorial<\/a> on sourdough. <strong>Starter is nothing short of magic<\/strong>: it bubbles and fizzes, weaving elastic strands of gluten that look not unlike Halloween\u2019s leftover decorative cobwebs. I was uncertain of how much flour to add during the final shaping stages, and the dough was sticky and stretchy and belligerent. But my <em>banneton<\/em> (a fortuitous purchase at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bhv.fr\/\">BHV<\/a>) coddled it gently through the night, and aside from a bit of sticking upon transfer from \u201cpeel\u201d (a.k.a. cookie sheet) to \u201cbaking stone\u201d (a.k.a. aluminum half-sheet), the process went reasonably well.<\/p>\n<p>Being an exacting sort of pioneer woman, I was of course expecting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.poilane.fr\/index.php?index_module=listings&amp;index_theme=english&amp;index_template=en_produit_bdd.php&amp;product_id=1\">Poil\u00e2ne <\/a>quality on the first try. Opening the oven, however, I was met with a fairly flat, amoeba-shaped loaf. I dismissively chucked it onto a cooling rack and slunk off to the river for a good cleansing. But, dear, patient reader, when it was thoroughly cooled, I cut off a good chunk and found it shot through with <strong>beautiful little air holes and pockets, off-white, giving off a slight sheen under the light<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/11\/Amoeba-bread1.jpg\"><\/p>\n<p>The crust was thin but crispy, the crumb delicate, chewy, and almost sweet. It might not be perfect, but it will make a quite satisfactory lunchtime vehicle for a swipe of peanut butter. It takes little to please a pioneer woman.<\/p>\n<p>This tale of self-sufficiency has only just begun. The starter lives on, and plans are in the works for another go with Mr. Lang\u2019s method next weekend. Perhaps the holidays will bring <em>Nancy Silverton\u2019s Breads from the La Brea Bakery<\/em>. That, and a KitchenAid mixer with a dough hook. <strong>I\u2019m desperate for a dough hook; it\u2019s so rough-and-tumble, so pointy and untamed.<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amateurgourmet.com\/the_amateur_gourmet\/ProjectSourdough.mov\">This guy<\/a> is much funnier than I am, and he\u2019s got pretty bread; I attribute it to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amateurgourmet.com\/the_amateur_gourmet\/breadmaking_101\/index.html\">the dough hook and gobs of large Tupperware<\/a>. All that stands between me and a KitchenAid mixer is my mother, who keeps hers\u2014a second-hand find of my father\u2019s that she\u2019s <em>never<\/em> used; oh, the waste!\u2014on the pantry floor, surrounded by mouse traps, old dog bowls, and rolls of paper towels. Look out, Oklahoma: come Thanksgiving, your mixer is mine. If it&#8217;s from Oklahoma, it must be authentically pioneer-esque, like me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Forget the Ann Demeulemeester sex bag and all that snooty France stuff; give me a bull-scrotum bag and the open prairie, land of my birth.
