June\u2019s middle names come from two of my mother&#8217;s siblings.

I like knowing that Tina and Jerry will always be with her now. Especially Tina, who wanted so much to meet her. I hope they got to wave to one another as they passed, Tina leaving and June arriving.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you so much for the support and care you\u2019ve shown me and Brandon in these past months and years.
