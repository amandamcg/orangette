I was going to serve you a real whopper of a dessert today. It was going to be the butterscotch budino from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mozza-la.com\/pizzeria\/about.cfm\">Pizzeria Mozza<\/a>, if you really want to know, the dessert that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/05\/09\/dining\/09mozz.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=mozza&amp;scp=5\">Frank Bruni<\/a> calls \u201ca pudding to shame all other puddings.\u201d  (Isn\u2019t that that the single best line of praise <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">ever<\/span>? I want someone to call <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">me<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> <\/span>\u201ca pudding to shame all other puddings.\u201d)  It was going to be <span>great<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Have you heard about it, this butterscotch budino?  I first learned of it when <a href=\"http:\/\/wednesdaychef.typepad.com\/the_wednesday_chef\/2007\/03\/sweet_reverie.html\">Luisa<\/a> wrote about Mozza last March, and then I went chasing the recipe, which, happily, was printed in the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\"><a style=\"font-style:italic;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/05\/09\/dining\/091mrex.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">New York Times<\/a>, <\/span><span>the<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> <a style=\"font-style:italic;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/features\/printedition\/food\/la-fow-honorrecs26dec26,0,5481277.story?page=12\">Los Angeles Times<\/a>, <\/span><span>and<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> <a style=\"font-style:italic;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/recipes\/food\/views\/239847\">Bon App\u00e9tit<\/a><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">, <\/span><\/span><span>each with a drool-inducing description.  It sounded heart-stoppingly good: a ramekin of rich butterscotch pudding topped with a warm caramel sauce and a hearty smattering of salt <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">and,<\/span> on top of that, a dollop of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche whipped cream.  Needless to say, I printed the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/05\/09\/dining\/091mrex.html\">recipe<\/a> and planned to make it immediately.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, <\/span>\u201cimmediately\u201d turned out to be this past weekend, which wasn\u2019t so immediate, but anyway.  I made it, and despite its three separate components, it was really quite simple and painless.  (I even made the <span>cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche <a href=\"http:\/\/wednesdaychef.typepad.com\/the_wednesday_chef\/2008\/01\/russ-parsonss-m.html\">from <span>scratch<\/span><\/a>! S<\/span>o much cheaper that way.<span>) But oh, I don<\/span>\u2019t know.  I didn\u2019t <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">love<\/span> it. Maybe I did something wrong? Or maybe it requires a pinch of pastry chef pixie dust that the recipe forgot to mention?  The pudding was very nice, but it didn\u2019t leave me clawing for more.  The caramel sauce was likewise tasty, but it didn\u2019t make me feel like ripping off my clothes and bathing in it, which, let\u2019s be honest, a really good caramel usually<span style=\"font-style:italic;\"> <\/span>makes me want to do.   It wasn\u2019t bad; I just wasn\u2019t as excited as I wanted to be.<\/p>\n<p>Does this make me a bad person?   A picky little twit? Or perhaps I\u2019m just so-so when it comes to making puddings and caramels?  Maybe I\u2019ll make it again this week, just to give it the good old college try.  Or maybe I\u2019ll dig out another recipe I clipped a couple of years ago, a recipe for butterscotch pot de cr<span>\u00e8me, and try <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">that<\/span><\/span> instead.  Would you like that?  I certainly would.  Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, this is just to say that I had Exciting! Fun!  Plans for today, but instead, I bring you an old standby.  Not that it\u2019s anything to sneeze at.  It\u2019s just less flashy, that\u2019s all.  It\u2019s the recipe for Brandon\u2019s quick black beans with cumin and oregano.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/24a84-blackbeans024-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/24a84-blackbeans024-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5158106648890506626\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Much like his <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/01\/brown-bag-it.html\">chickpea salad<\/a>, these beans are something we eat often for lunch, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, when we want to sit down and share a meal but don\u2019t feel much like fussing.  We ate them yesterday, in fact, and in mid-chew, I thought, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Gosh, I really should tell them about this<\/span>.  Which is more than I can say for some things.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here, but I really do believe it: that there is great value, people, in knowing how to doctor a can of beans.  It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.  It\u2019s one of those important life skills, like knowing how to make a bed, tie your shoes, or operate a corkscrew. In this case, you just cook an onion in olive oil, add some cumin and oregano and a good splash of hot sauce, and then chuck in a can of beans, juices and all.  (I know the can juices can seem kind of yucky, but as Brandon likes to say, think of it as a broth of sorts.  Doesn\u2019t that feel better?) It all burbles together for a few minutes, just long enough to warm through, and then it\u2019s ready to go, earthy and spicy and faintly sweet. With a green salad on the side, or some sliced avocado, or some bread and a hunk of cheddar, or, heck, whatever\u2019s in the fridge, these beans make a terrific, easy lunch.  Which, if you ask me, is much more important than pudding anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Have a happy week, friends.  I\u2019ll see you on the canned beans aisle.<\/p>\n<p>***<\/p>\n<p>Oh, but wait!  One more thing: our <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">cooking class<\/span> on \u201cmisunderstood\u201d winter vegetables &#8211; Brussels sprouts, fennel, and cauliflower &#8211; is coming up fast!

Brandon usually uses Trader Joe\u2019s brand, or Bush\u2019s, or Goya, and all are very good. Yesterday we made these beans with Western Family organic brand, and they weren\u2019t nearly as tasty.  So be choosy about your beans.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and about hot sauces: you can use most any brand of Mexican-style hot sauce, but if you happen to make <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/03\/hot-sauce.html\">this kind<\/a>, save the strained solids and use a spoonful in this dish.  They toast a little in the heat of the pan, and the resulting flavor is really <span>terrific<\/span>. We\u2019ve also used Tapati\u00f3, and it was very good too.<\/p>\n<p>Olive oil<br \/>1 medium yellow onion, diced<br \/>1 tsp. ground cumin<br \/>\u00bd tsp. dried oregano<br \/>\u00bd tsp. Mexican-style hot sauce, or more to taste (this amount makes mild beans)<br \/>1 small (or \u00bd medium) clove garlic, pressed<br \/>1 (15-ounce) can black beans<br \/>\u00bc tsp. salt, or to taste<\/p>\n<p>Pour a glug of olive oil into a medium saucepan, and warm it over medium heat.  Add the onion, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent and pale golden. It should be just starting to caramelize; it might scorch a bit in areas too, and that\u2019s just fine.  Add the ground cumin and oregano, and stir well.  Add the hot sauce, and stir well again.  Add the garlic, followed by the beans and their can juices.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until the beans are soft and warmed through.  (Some brands of beans are softer than others; some will be ready as soon as they\u2019re warm, but some need more time.)  Taste, and salt as needed.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Note<\/span>: This recipe doubles easily. There\u2019s no need to double the onion, though; one is plenty for two cans of beans.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: 2 servings<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I had big plans.
