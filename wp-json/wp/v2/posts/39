I have a writer friend who once told me that she didn&#8217;t feel right if she wasn&#8217;t writing regularly, that she woke up each morning <i>needing<\/i> to write, and until very recently, I didn&#8217;t really believe her, because it never felt that straightforward to me. (I also wanted, uh, just a little bit, to reach out and strangle her with my bare hands; she made writing sound <i>so easy<\/i>.) I never felt that kind of imperative to be a writer &#8211; or, really, to be anything in particular. Writing sneaked up on me. But now that I&#8217;ve been at it for a while, I sometimes get a sense, just the faintest nudge of a sense, of what my friend might have meant. I&#8217;m best when I&#8217;m writing, even if I sit down at my desk without a thing to say, with only that itch to go on.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e5a10-306600311.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/e5a10-306600311.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"424\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I am coming off a spectacular run of cooking failures. I curdled a batch of chocolate pudding &#8211; and then\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/yTAqcEuD3A\/?modal=true\" target=\"_blank\">fed it to my kid<\/a> anyway, because two-year-olds don&#8217;t care if their &#8220;chockit put-TING!&#8221; has the texture of hummus. I also made a braised zucchini side-dish recipe that involved a whole stick of butter and was totally, totally not worth that stick of butter. (We smashed it to a paste, however, and used it as pasta sauce; <i>that<\/i> was tasty.) One morning, I drank half a cup of coffee too many and, while flailing around to my <a href=\"https:\/\/play.spotify.com\/user\/molly.wizenberg\/playlist\/4TwYYZrF9tDtagXghfji31\" target=\"_blank\">Guy Picciotto playlist<\/a> on Spotify, made an obscure type of French cookie that, as it turns out, should remain obscure. I also made a tomato-rice soup that promised a flavor akin to <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/09\/on-cue.html\" target=\"_blank\">stuffed tomatoes<\/a>, and frankly, you know, next time, I&#8217;ll just make the stuffed tomatoes. Meanwhile, the dishwasher quietly died, and one side of the sink stopped draining well, and then, late one night, I rinsed the sludge from a one-pound can of salt-cured anchovies into that side of the sink, and my status as a genius was finally, once and for all, secured!<\/p>\n<p>On the upside, Matthew and I taped a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/2015\/02\/05\/episode-161-fennel\/\" target=\"_blank\">fennel episode<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Spilled Milk<\/a>, and in doing so, I was reminded of how good, and how easy, a <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/10\/special-game-fennel-salad.html\" target=\"_blank\">shaved fennel salad<\/a> is. I&#8217;ve made it twice since our taping. And on Wednesday night, less than 48 hours after Luisa posted it, I made Melissa Clark&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewednesdaychef.com\/the_wednesday_chef\/2015\/02\/melissa-clarks-braised-beans-with-bacon-and-wine.html\" target=\"_blank\">braised beans with bacon and wine<\/a>, which is as good as Luisa promised. (I didn&#8217;t soak my beans, FYI.) June loves it, though I&#8217;m not sure if her opinion will mean anything to you anymore, now that I&#8217;ve told you about the chocolate pudding.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/085d0-306700151.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/085d0-306700151.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"424\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>It often occurs to me that nothing is more satisfying than a well-made pot of beans. Except I should add that the other night, while the pot of beans was burbling away, doing its thing, I watched <a href=\"http:\/\/joannagoddard.blogspot.com\/2015\/02\/on-aging.html\" target=\"_blank\">this wise snippet<\/a> from Frances McDormand, and that was also satisfying in its way. And then I got out the sewing machine that Brandon bought me for Christmas &#8211; which I just learned how to use on Monday, thanks to a lesson with Keli of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.drygoodsdesignonline.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Drygoods Design<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; and sewed two doll-sized pillows and one mouse-sized reversible blanket from some fabric scraps. As my friend <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bookscoutblog.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrea<\/a> aptly observed, my quarter-life crisis is coming along well. I love Andrea.<\/p>\n<p>Ah! I feel better already.<\/p>\n<p>Have a great weekend, everybody.
