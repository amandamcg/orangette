At lunch that day, this cook made a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mignonette_sauce\">mignonette<\/a>, and then he shucked three oysters and put them on a plate. Then he dared me. I was tempted to punch him in the face. I was not pleased. I did what I do when I am presented with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/2010\/08\/19\/episode-19-scary-food\">something that scares the crap out of me<\/a>. I picked up an oyster, stared at it, and felt like I was going to cry.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ee57a-86460015-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5528058688218044402\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ee57a-86460015-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1049\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I made everyone look away, and then I ate it. Only one, and it was tiny, but I ate it. I chewed and everything. I didn\u2019t die. And when I swallowed, the flavor rang around my mouth the way the ringing of a bell ricochets inside a cathedral, now here, now there, and it did that for maybe ten seconds, now here, now there, before it dissipated. It tasted like seawater and melon and wet rocks. I didn\u2019t even hate it. I almost liked it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/eda30-58320030-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5528058930996582290\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/eda30-58320030-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1061\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to tell you that I am a reformed person, or that I pop oysters like jelly beans. I\u2019m still working on that. Last spring, the first time I was faced with a dozen oysters, a whole dozen to myself, I felt like ducking under the table and making a run for it. I was forced to resort to something like Lamaze breathing techniques, a full-body <i>aaaah-hooooooooo<\/i>, to get me from oyster to oyster. Sometimes I still do. But it\u2019s getting easier. And it\u2019s worth it to me, because there is no other flavor like it, anywhere. I\u2019m glad I learned that, that I let myself learn it.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4296c-86460005-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5528059135755799810\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4296c-86460005-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1053\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, when we had <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2010\/10\/because-there-was-bag-of-plums.html\">friends in town<\/a>, I took them to our neighborhood oyster bar, a place called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewalrusbar.com\/TWB\/home.html\">the Walrus and the Carpenter<\/a>, where I took most of these pictures. We ate oysters from the Effingham Inlet, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Ben had never had them before, and when he tasted his first, he yelled <i>OH MY GOD<\/i>, and I\u2019m almost certain, almost, that he would have done that even if he hadn\u2019t been drinking a cocktail called the Mustache Ride.

We talked about Seattle restaurants, about where he took his wife for their wedding anniversary, about our dogs, about his kids. He has a son in his early twenties, and this son is away at college, but sometimes when they\u2019re together, he told me, they go out for oysters. They\u2019ll suck down four or five dozen, he said, grinning, and they\u2019ll drink some beers, just the two of them, and a couple of hours will go by, and it\u2019s <i>just great<\/i>, he said. And then he grinned even wider, thinking about it, and he sort of hopped around in his seat, and his face got pink, and he started to giggle.
