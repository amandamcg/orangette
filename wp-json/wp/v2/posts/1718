New York may have nearly everything a girl could want, but it doesn\u2019t have <strong>the Knights<\/strong>. And really, who else would respond with such unquestioning enthusiasm when I call to propose deep-frying a pound of ricotta cheese spiked with bourbon and lemon zest?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d been eyeing a recipe for <em>frittelle di ricotta<\/em>, or ricotta fritters, for nearly three months, since <em>Saveur Cooks Authentic Italian<\/em> landed on my bookshelf. It was a dangerous proposition, however, for a single-occupant household: <strong>no one should ever, under any circumstances, be left alone with two dozen ricotta fritters and a box of powdered sugar<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>So the recipe waited, as many have been known to do, in a pile on the kitchen counter, until the first twinges of fall sent me pawing after it. The nights are starting their long, slow stretch; the mornings grow cooler and cloudier; and nothing sounds so good as the homey, rustic richness of fresh ricotta, a warming nip of bourbon, and a burbling vat of oil to fry it all in. Call it <strong>the \u201cfattening-up\u201d instinct<\/strong>, but in times like these\u2014as well as many others, of course\u2014it\u2019s good to know the Knight family. I\u2019ve never minded drinking alone, but frying is another matter entirely.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Ricotta_fritters_green_bracelet_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/09\/Ricotta_fritters_green_bracelet_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>So it was that I arrived at their door with a bowl of batter and a quart of canola oil. They met me with a Costco-size bag of powdered sugar and a well-seasoned wok, and on a mid-week work night, with fall unfolding on the other side of the window, we stationed ourselves before the stove, set the oil to bubbling, and we fried.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Ricotta_fritters_blue_plate_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/09\/Ricotta_fritters_blue_plate_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>The fritters were golden and crispy to the tooth, with a lightness that belied their oily baptism. Beneath its delicate, crackling exterior, the ricotta was warm, <strong>meltingly soft and cloudlike, some ethereal intermediate between souffl\u00e9 and softly scrambled egg<\/strong>. Perfumed with bourbon and the lightly bitter edge of lemon zest, its clean dairy flavor became something complex, both edgy and soothing.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Ricotta_fritters_counter_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/09\/Ricotta_fritters_counter_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Ricotta_fritters_Kate_fingers_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/09\/Ricotta_fritters_Kate_fingers_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Kate gave the fritters a good snowy sprinkling of sugar, while the family patriarch, declaring them <strong>\u201cpure ambrosia,\u201d<\/strong> sent up a cry for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.surlatable.com\/common\/products\/product_details.cfm?PRRFNBR=5688\">whipped cream siphon<\/a>. Without the Knights, dear reader, the world might never have known <strong>a lily so gilded<\/strong> as a cream-topped, powdered-sugar-dusted ricotta fritter.<\/p>\n<p>I may have passed on the cream, myself, but I did manage to get three fat fritters past these lips.

The original recipe also calls for brandy, but I substituted Woodford Reserve bourbon instead, since I didn\u2019t have any brandy lying around.
