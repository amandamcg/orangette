Tonight I\u2019m exhausted, but it only makes my singing voice more dramatic.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the time of year when we all do lots of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/il-faut-cultiver-notre-jardin.html\">giving and receiving<\/a>, and I\u2019ve decided to do what I should have been doing for ages: make Christmas presents with my own two hands\u2014in my kitchen, of course. My wallet is chronically malnourished, and anyway, <strong>my kitchen offers real benefits over the mall<\/strong>: no aggressive, blindingly sparkly decorations; no plastic figurines blaring carols; no tearing-out of hair over parking spaces; no sad, picked-over stacks of turtlenecks; no need to put on real clothing; and, best of all, easy access to nourishment and appropriately raucous or melancholy music. <strong>Sixteen pounds of apples, twenty-two Kerr jars, four cups of walnuts, two candy thermometers, several late nights, and more than a pound of butter<\/strong> later, I feel like a regular sugar-plum fairy. Unfortunately, because I\u2019ve needed culinary advice and people to entertain me while I work, nearly everyone on my list knows what they\u2019re getting for Christmas. But they\u2019re not complaining, and wisely so.<\/p>\n<p>And aside from all the other perks, I\u2019ve learned an important lesson from all this Christmas craft-making:<strong> nothing (but <em>nothing<\/em>) is more satisfying that canning<\/strong>. Add this to the list of reasons why I\u2019d make a good <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/09\/on-cheese-and-frivolity.html\">Depression<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/11\/on-self-sufficiency-and-sourdough.html\">wife<\/a>. Thanks to Heidi from <a href=\"http:\/\/101cookbooks.com\/\">101 Cookbooks<\/a>, I\u2019ve been able to transform apples, cider, lemon juice, sugar, cinnamon, and cloves into something lasting, a little jar that could\u2014if you\u2019re very careful and disciplined\u2014sustain you through winter.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Apple_butter_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/12\/Apple_butter_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>There\u2019s something magical about <strong>a pot of fruit simmering on the stove, slowly darkening and thickening, growing shiny and smooth<\/strong>, becoming <a href=\"http:\/\/www.101cookbooks.com\/archives\/000125.html\">apple butter<\/a>. Then there comes the ladle and the tongs, a cauldron of boiling water, and the gentle pop of the lid as it seals. If you repeat this process four times, as I did, you\u2019ll have twenty golden-amber jars to line up on the counter and admire. It\u2019s tempting to keep them all, like a squirrel hoarding nuts, but the stuff is so delicious\u2014spicy, sweet, and with a zing of lemon\u2014that you <em>might<\/em> want to give it away, if only for the compliments you&#8217;ll get in return.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of compliments, my mother has long been legendary for <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/11\/to-cherry-pit-spitter-on-her-58th.html\">her toffee<\/a>, and with her blessing, I hope I&#8217;ll soon be too.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/toffee_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/12\/toffee_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>It&#8217;s only <strong>slightly less addictive than crack, and infinitely tastier<\/strong>. Toffee lovers on coasts east and west, as well as in that skillet-shaped state called Oklahoma, have gushed over its deep caramel-coffeeness and toothsome crunch. It\u2019s pretty too, its topcoat generously marbled with white and dark chocolates. And if you\u2019re very lucky, it could snag you a choice gift at your holiday party at work, as it did for me:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Lady_Frankenstein_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/12\/Lady_Frankenstein_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>So tonight I\u2019ll stay in, out of the fog and away from the carols sung in electronic voices. I\u2019ll open a bottle of wine, steal another taste of toffee, and perhaps do a little song-and-dance number on the linoleum in the kitchen, sticky though it is with apple butter splatters. <em>Lady Frankenstein<\/em>, however, will stay securely sealed in her plastic wrapping.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">[Special thanks and many squeezes to Mom for the <strong>brand-new digital camera(!)<\/strong> and to Nicho for the <strong>beautiful handmade cherry cutting board<\/strong>, which makes a very sophisticated backdrop for the toffee above, no? I do love giving, but sometimes receiving is even better.]<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Coffee-Walnut Toffee<\/strong><br \/>Adapted ever-so-slightly from <em>Bon App\u00e9tit Christmas<\/em> (1994)<\/p>\n<p>It may just be me, but anything that requires a candy thermometer seems daunting\u2014and that\u2019s even before taking into consideration the boiling, roiling, burbling sugar, something between molten lava and a swamp in a horror movie. But surprisingly, this toffee is remarkably easy and non-threatening to make, especially if you have your <em>mise en place<\/em> (your ingredients, prepped and measured) ready and waiting. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll feel a goofy, giddy shiver as you happily dump into the pot little pre-measured bowlfuls of this and that, just like Julia or Martha would do. And remember, the candy thermometer is your friend. Trust it, and you\u2019ll have a long, happy, toffee-filled holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>2 cups walnuts<br \/>1 cup sugar<br \/>1\/3 cup packed golden brown sugar<br \/>2 tsp instant espresso powder<br \/>\u00bd tsp ground cinnamon<br \/>\u00bc tsp salt<br \/>1\/3 cup water<br \/>1 Tbs dark unsulfured molasses<br \/>4 \u00bd ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped (I used Valhrona 64%)<br \/>4 \u00bd ounces fine-quality white chocolate, finely chopped (I used Callebaut)<br \/>1 \u00bc cups (2 \u00bd sticks) unsalted butter<\/p>\n<p>Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Spread walnuts on a cookie sheet and toast in the oven until fragrant, about 5-10 minutes, making sure they don\u2019t burn. Allow to cool for ten minutes; then coarsely chop. Remove 1 \u00bd cups to a bowl. Finely chop remaining \u00bd cup; then place in a separate bowl.<\/p>\n<p>Prepare your mise en place: in a medium bowl, combine sugars, espresso powder, cinnamon, and salt. In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine water and molasses. Place chopped chocolates in their own separate bowls.<\/p>\n<p>Butter a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan. Melt butter in a heavy 2 \u00bd-quart saucepan over low heat. Add sugars, espresso powder, cinnamon, salt, water, and molasses; stir until sugar dissolves. Attach a clip-on candy thermometer to side of pan. Increase heat to medium; cook until thermometer registers 290 degrees (and no less!), stirring slowly but constantly and scraping bottom of pan with a wooden spatula, about 20 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Remove pan from heat, and quickly stir in 1 \u00bd cups coarsely chopped nuts. Immediately pour mixture onto prepared pan; do not scrape saucepan. Tilt sheet so that toffee spreads to \u00bc-inch thickness. Sprinkle chocolates by generous tablespoonfuls atop toffee, alternating bittersweet and white chocolates. Let stand one minute. Using back of spoon, spread chocolates slightly. Using the tip of a knife or the tongs of a fork, swirl chocolates to create a marble pattern. Sprinkle with \u00bd cup finely chopped nuts. Refrigerate until toffee is firm, about one hour. Break toffee into pieces.<\/p>\n<p>Makes about two pounds. Can be made two weeks ahead and stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container. Serve cold or at room temperature.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some nights were made for Jeff Buckley and my stove\u2014many nights, in fact, and especially when the city is draped in a misty, blue-gray cloak of fog.
