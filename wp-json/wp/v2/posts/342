A few days later,\u00a0we lost our manager at Delancey and Essex. Though losing a staff member always makes me and Brandon feel mopey for a while, the timing was eerily right. \u00a0I hadn\u2019t been involved in the day-to-day operation of the restaurants since last summer, shortly before June was born,\u00a0but suddenly, with the book out the door, I had some time on my hands. And anyway, I\u2019m not very good at not having a project.\u00a0So I\u2019m back to managing Delancey and Essex.\u00a0My job isn\u2019t the kind of thing that most people fantasize about when they think about opening a restaurant; it doesn\u2019t involve a chef\u2019s coat, gleaming copper pots, copious booze, or anything that could remotely be described as\u00a0<i>badass<\/i>. \u00a0I do payroll, front-of-house scheduling, organizing, filing, e-mail tending, and polite whip-cracking. \u00a0I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, but I like it. I like the quiet aspect of it, the behind-the-scenes-ness of it, the tangibility of it, the fact that I get to make things work better. \u00a0It brings a kind of satisfaction that\u2019s\u00a0very different from writing.<\/p>\n<p>So the days are full. I\u2019m at the restaurant during the daytime hours on Wednesdays and Fridays, and June and I also stop in most evenings, before she goes to bed. June drools on everyone within a ten-foot radius and, when she\u2019s feeling sporting, lets me dance her along the bar like a marionette. \u00a0I know she will see in us the many stresses and frustrations that come with owning a small business, but when I think about her growing up there, in that community, with so many people who care about her and have known her since she was born, I feel glad in a way that I don\u2019t have words for.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/fa76b-photo1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/fa76b-photo1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"525\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>In any case, it\u2019s true what they say:\u00a0there\u2019s never a dull moment. \u00a0On Thursday, I got a splinter in my tongue\u00a0while using chopsticks to eat bibimbap. On Friday, I dreamt that my mother confessed that she doesn\u2019t like my bangs, something I have long suspected. A few nights before that, I read a\u00a0<i>New Yorker<\/i>\u00a0article about Ruth Bader Ginsburg while taking a hot bath. I don\u2019t like to make a big deal of it, but yes, the rumors you\u2019ve heard are real: my lifestyle was the inspiration behind Katy Perry\u2019s hit song &#8220;Last Friday Night.&#8221;\u00a0Tonight I might\u00a0throw caution to the wind and mix up the dry ingredients for tomorrow morning\u2019s baked oatmeal.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4d442-polabakedoatmeal1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/4d442-polabakedoatmeal1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"476\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been in a bookstore or on the Internet anytime in the past couple of years, you\u2019ve no doubt heard of Heidi Swanson\u2019s wonderful <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Super-Natural-Every-Day-Well-Loved\/dp\/1580082777\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=super%20natural%20every%20day&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1362865288&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Super Natural Every Day<\/a><\/i>, and you\u2019ve probably also heard of her wonderful baked oatmeal. \u00a0I first tasted it shortly after Heidi\u2019s\u00a0book came out, when\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sweetamandine.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Jess<\/a>\u00a0came to visit and made a batch, and then\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.leciawphinney.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Lecia<\/a>\u00a0brought some over one morning when we met for a walk, and now, for the past few months, I\u2019ve been making it nearly every other week. \u00a0Maybe you\u2019ve been making it, too, but I wanted to mention it, in case you haven\u2019t. \u00a0Because you should.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a tiny chance that some of my love for this oatmeal has to do with the fact that I can assemble most of it the night before. \u00a0(I am not so great at making a hot breakfast with Tiny Nose-Biter around, or not unless it\u2019s mostly done when I climb out of bed.) \u00a0There\u2019s also a tiny chance that I love this recipe because I will eat anything that involves oats. \u00a0(The only way I would probably not eat oats is if I found them in my coat pocket, tangled in lint. \u00a0Probably.) \u00a0But mostly, I love this oatmeal because it pushes all the buttons that I like breakfast to push: it\u2019s sweet but not too sweet and\u00a0filling but not too filling, and it makes you feel totally virtuous about eating maple syrup and butter. \u00a0Plus: the leftovers might be my favorite snack, whether hot, room temperature, or cold.<\/p>\n<p>Happy week!

It\u2019s nice to toast the nuts beforehand \u2013 and it\u2019s easy: just a few minutes on a sheet pan in a 350\u00b0F oven, until they smell fragrant \u2013 but I often skip it. No harm done.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a big believer in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.details.com\/style-advice\/the-body\/201105\/skim-milk-non-fat-milk-diet-foods\" target=\"_blank\">whole milk<\/a>, and I think this recipe needs its fat and richness. (I\u2019ve had it\u00a0with 1% and was disappointed in the result.) Actually, the next time I make this oatmeal, I might try replacing a cup of the milk with coconut milk. \u00a0That could be exciting. \u00a0I might also throw in a half-cup of unsweetened shredded coconut. \u00a0I\u2019ve added coconut before &#8211; about a quarter-cup, or 25 grams &#8211; and though I can\u2019t say that I was aware of its presence, Brandon and I both agreed that the baked oatmeal was especially good that morning.<\/p>\n<p>As for the fruit, you could use any berry, including frozen ones. I don\u2019t even worry about thawing them first. \u00a0I suggest a range of amounts for the berries below, one that\u2019s very berry-y and one that\u2019s less so.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 cups (200 grams) rolled oats\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd cup (60 g) walnut halves, toasted and chopped\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 teaspoon baking powder\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd teaspoons ground cinnamon\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd teaspoon fine sea salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00be to 1 \u00bd cups (90 to 185 g) blueberries\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 cups (475 ml) whole milk\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1\/3 cup (80 ml) maple syrup\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 large egg\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 tablespoons (45 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 teaspoons vanilla extract          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F with a rack in the top third of the oven.<\/p>\n<p>In an 8-inch square baking dish, mix together the oats, the nuts, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. (This part can be done the night before, if you like, to make things easier in the morning.) Scatter the berries evenly over the oat mixture.<\/p>\n<p>In another bowl, whisk together the milk, maple syrup, egg, about half of the butter, and vanilla. Slowly drizzle the milk mixture over the oats. Gently give the baking dish a couple of thwacks on the countertop to make sure the liquid moves down through the oats.<\/p>\n<p>Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the top is golden and the oat mixture has set. Remove from the oven, and allow to cool for a few minutes. If the remaining butter has solidified, rewarm it slightly; then drizzle it over the top of the oatmeal.
