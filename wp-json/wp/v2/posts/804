Unless you were submerged up to the neck in a swimming pool, it was too hot and humid to be outside. But this city, my adopted city, opens wide up in the summer. Every window is propped up or swung out, everywhere, and everyone is in the street. I am writing this with the front door open, and from the neighbors\u2019 house, which also has its front door open, the Supremes are singing \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4yoIacOHp0s&amp;feature=related\">Come See About Me<\/a>.\u201d Two nights ago, on a walk around the neighborhood with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/3211083014\/in\/set-72157606225919775\/\">the dog<\/a>, I passed an old man playing the guitar on a front porch, a kid in gym shorts playing the guitar on another front porch, a young man playing the cello on a third front porch, and a house whose curtains were clearly so ecstatic about the weather that they sneaked out through an upstairs window to billow and twist in the breeze. It\u2019s time for a popsicle.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/def1a-4784791632_d6f39c33871.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"487\" height=\"500\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9337 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/07\/def1a-4784791632_d6f39c33871.jpg\" alt=\"def1a-4784791632_d6f39c33871\" \/><br \/>\n<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This is a raspberry yogurt popsicle. It is also known as What Kept Me Alive in the Hot Delancey Kitchen Last Summer, or The Menu Item That We Didn\u2019t Sell Much of, Because I Ate Them All. I first made these popsicles a few weeks before we opened, and when we were planning our opening menu, I knew they had to be on it. Have you ever seen what happens to adults when you put popsicles on the table in front of them? Namely, popsicles in shot glasses? They grin uncontrollably. It\u2019s beautiful.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of articles lately about popsicles, and I\u2019m not surprised. They\u2019re easy to make, and less fiddly than homemade ice cream. You can make them from lemonade, fruit juice, almost anything. When I was a kid, my mother had a set of plastic popsicle molds, molds a little like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moma.org\/collection\/browse_results.php?object_id=1180\">this<\/a>, and she used to make guava popsicles for me, using Ocean Spray pink guava juice. I had no idea what a guava was, but I had a sense that it was very fancy, and this was convenient, because it kept me from complaining about the fact that I wasn\u2019t eating <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Otter_Pops\">Otter Pops<\/a>. But that was years ago, and her molds are gone, probably to the graveyard of boxes in the attic. For a long time, I didn\u2019t think about popsicles. I forgot. But then, last summer, at a friend\u2019s party, a box of popsicles came out, and not long after, I was making a batch of raspberry frozen yogurt from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidlebovitz.com\/\">David Lebovitz<\/a>\u2019s book <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPerfect-Scoop-Sorbets-Granitas-Accompaniments%2Fdp%2F158008219X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1278912186%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Perfect Scoop<\/span><\/a> when I suddenly thought, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">This wants to be a popsicle<\/span>. Clear as a bell.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not as easy as pouring guava juice into a mold, but it\u2019s close. It\u2019s like making a smoothie, only the goal is to lick it, not drink it. You take some raspberries &#8211; frozen or fresh, either way &#8211; and some plain yogurt, and you put them in a blender with sugar and a splash of lemon juice. When it\u2019s smooth, you press it through a strainer to catch the seeds, and then you divide it among your molds. If you have proper popsicle molds, you are a lucky person. If not, try other vessels. I use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jgbarsupplies.co.uk\/ekmps\/shops\/johngloversales\/images\/tall-vodka-shot-glass-801-p.jpg\">tall, narrow shot glasses<\/a>, the ones often sold as vodka shooters. I\u2019ll bet small Dixie cups would work well, too. Whatever you use, it\u2019s hard to go wrong. You\u2019ve got raspberries and yogurt on your team, and summer has only started.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Raspberry Yogurt Popsicles<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPerfect-Scoop-Sorbets-Granitas-Accompaniments%2Fdp%2F158008219X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1278912186%26sr%3D1-1&tag=orangette-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Perfect Scoop<\/span><\/a>, by David Lebovitz<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2010-07-12T07:14:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/804?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>These pops are perfectly tangy and perfectly sweet, and the best part is, the yogurt flavor really shines. Be sure to use whole-milk yogurt, not low-fat or nonfat. It tastes better, and it makes for a better tasting popsicle. I buy my popsicle sticks at Fred Meyer, but you can also find them at craft stores.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, I should tell you that these popsicles will not be as smooth, texture-wise, as churned frozen yogurt. They will be a little icy &#8211; you know, like a popsicle.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 cups (480 grams) plain whole-milk yogurt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 cups (240 grams) fresh or frozen raspberries\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00be cup (150 grams) sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tsp. lemon juice          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Combine all ingredients in the jar of a blender, and process until smooth.
