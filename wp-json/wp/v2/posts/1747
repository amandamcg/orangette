All told, it\u2019s been a lovely couple of months, with social theory by day and Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s theories by night\u2014although, truth be told, I\u2019ve occasionally been known to skip lightly over the former and head straight for the latter. I mean, really, with four episodes per DVD and only a limited timeframe on the rental, I don\u2019t have much of a choice. And anyway, <strong>the whole \u201cstick\u201d part of the equation is overrated<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>As one would expect, other rewards have been gastronomic in nature. For example, <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/01\/relearning-chinese.html\">hand-shaved noodles at Shanghai Garden<\/a> make for <strong>a<\/strong> <strong>comforting (and only slightly greasy) pat on the back<\/strong>, and I\u2019ve also found myself unusually motivated by the promise of an early-evening <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/09\/fallafel-and-gin-by-way-of-anniversary.html\">gin and tonic<\/a>, although any thoughts of further nighttime productivity are quashed\u2014and not unhappily, I\u2019ll admit\u2014with the first cold, limey sip. Of course, chocolate in its many forms is also a good bonus, and a silky wedge of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cowgirlcreamery.com\/cheeses\/index.html\">Cowgirl Creamery\u2019s Mt. Tam<\/a> does the trick too, preferably right off the side of the knife, sometime between 4 and 6 pm. But if we\u2019re going to get really precise, <strong>lately my carrot is a radish<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>You can try to argue, spouting off about snobbery or Chirac, but the French are <em>magnifique<\/em>: they truly understand radishes. My love for <em>la douce France<\/em> has long been documented, and now that I\u2019m writing a thesis on the French and their social security system, it\u2019s also engraved in the halls of academia\u2014but my devotion reached new heights a few weeks ago, when I had my first taste of <strong>a radish with salted butter<\/strong>. Here in the States, we tend to relegate the poor things to the bottom of the salad bowl, but the French give radishes pride of place, serving them at aperitif hour, halved, dragged through soft butter, and dusted with salt. Though I\u2019d known for years of this sophisticated practice, I hadn\u2019t tried it myself until a recent trip to the grocery store\u2014a late-afternoon break from the computer\u2014when I found myself before a basketful of fat, scarlet radishes. <strong>Deep, dark pink with roots tipped in white, they were round as tiny globes and appealingly mottled with dirt<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>So I scooped up a bunch, brought them home, poured myself a cool glass of white wine, and pulled from the fridge a foil-wrapped brick of lightly salted <a href=\"http:\/\/www.poubelle.com\/butterpig\/archives\/000025.html\">Plugra<\/a>. While the butter softened, I closed the books and shut down the computer, drowning out its chirpy \u201cexit Windows\u201d sound with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/tg\/detail\/-\/B0000084R6\/ref=m_art_li_1\/103-0739602-8311833?v=glance&amp;s=music\">Jacques Dutronc<\/a>\u2019s very appropriate \u201c<em>J\u2019ai tout lu, tout vu, tout bu<\/em>.\u201d And then I turned to the reward at hand: radishes, two ways.<\/p>\n<p>First, I gave them each a good scrubbing and snipped off their ratty roots and water-logged leaves. A couple of them I halved from stem to stern, giving them a generous, <strong>satiny smear of Plugra<\/strong> and, just for good measure, a sprinkling of fleur de sel.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Radish_on_counter_left_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/05\/Radish_on_counter_left_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>They were a play of contrasting textures and flavors: <strong>the radish\u2019s crisp crunch cloaked by the unctuousness of butter<\/strong>, its mild but peppery bite tamed by salt and cream. Washed down with a sip of wine, it was quite possibly the perfect reward. But the picture could only get rosier with the addition of another French inspiration, the baguette.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Radishes_single_with_butter_top_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/05\/Radishes_single_with_butter_top_text.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>So the radish made a second appearance, and this time in more elegant attire: sliced paper thin like translucent sheets of ice, laid atop a well-buttered slab of baguette, and dusted with finely ground pink Hawaiian sea salt.* Dear reader, <strong>this was a radish ready for the ball, wrapped in its finest feathers and frippery<\/strong>\u2014or at least, like the girl consuming it, ready for a night consisting of something more than computers, keyboards, and the old carrot-and-stick.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">*Fancy-pants salt courtesy of an exceedingly generous New York-based reader; really, <em>monsieur<\/em>, you outdid yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m a loyal fan of the carrot-and-stick approach.
