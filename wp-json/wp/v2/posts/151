I\u2019ve always loved to travel, and to travel alone, and I still do. I knew June and Brandon were fine, helped along by grandparents and friends, and I didn\u2019t worry. I want her to have sturdy attachments to people who aren\u2019t her parents. Plus, it was good to have time to sort of live my pre-June life again. I liked that life a lot.<\/p>\n<p>But there was one big thing that I missed about having her around, and that\u2019s this: being with a young child forces you to be <i>radically present<\/i>. You can\u2019t zone out, replaying this morning or planning for tomorrow, when you\u2019re at the beach with your kid, because while you\u2019re zoning out, she\u2019s going to put her sticky sandy hand in your friend\u2019s Tupperware of roasted asparagus. You\u2019ve got to stay there. You\u2019re on. I\u2019m glad for that, even if I\u2019m not very good at it.
