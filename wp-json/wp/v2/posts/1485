I didn\u2019t mean to let a whole week go by before telling you more about my Paris trip.  Settling back into home kept me busier than I\u2019d planned.<\/p>\n<p>But yes, now, where were we?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/604b5-france2007033-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/604b5-france2007033-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5061886548672210370\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>One day last week, I was exchanging e-mails with a friend who is headed to Paris for the first time this summer.  In the midst of our back-and-forth about this bistro and that, he said something that sums up pretty much everything I want to tell you about my trip.  \u201cThe only reason I travel,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis for an excuse to eat more than usual.\u201d  I like that.  Not that I <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">need<\/span> an excuse, you know, but France is certainly a convincing one.  It\u2019s basically a cheese cellar the size of Texas.  That\u2019s why I love it so much.  Or partly, anyway.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/b9107-france2007182-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/b9107-france2007182-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5061250339461621090\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>When I go to Paris, my activities fit under three general categories: eating, walking, and walking to the next place where I\u2019ll find something to eat.  I couldn\u2019t tell you what the inside of Notre Dame looks like, but I do know how to get, on foot, from that butcher shop on rue Oberkampf &#8211; the one with the red exterior and the especially good chickens &#8211; to that <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">boulangerie<\/span> way down in the 15th where my host mother bought her <a style=\"font-style:italic;\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Canel%C3%A9\">cannel\u00e9s<\/a>.  It\u2019s a matter of priorities.  When I was last in Paris, during the summer of 2004, I was supposed to be doing pilot research for a dissertation on French social security.  I knew it was a doomed proposition when I noticed that my notepad was filled with addresses for bakeries and chocolate shops, not news clippings about health insurance reform or jottings from interviews. Paris has a way of getting your priorities straight.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/fcb00-france2007026-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/fcb00-france2007026-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5059844201528648914\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Mom and I headed out on this trip without much in the way of goals, aside from spending some time together. But soon enough, a couple of priorities became clear, and one of them was a homely little fruit called a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">nefle<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>We were introduced to them at the home of our expat friends Michael and Becky, artist and writer, respectively, and fine cooks both.  A few days into our trip, they had us in for a lunch of fresh fava beans and sheep\u2019s milk cheese, a rosy roast of beef, and, to finish, a bowl of fruit.  It was in this last that I found the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">nefle<\/span><span>, also<\/span> called a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Loquat\">loquat<\/a> or Japanese medlar in English, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">n\u00edspero<\/span> in Spanish, and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">nespola<\/span> in Italian.  To be honest, had it not been explicitly offered, I would never have chosen it.  I\u2019m the type who will actually mope &#8211; huff, puff, you name it &#8211; when I find a piece of blemished fruit in my grocery bag.  When <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">nefles<\/span> are ripe, they are essentially one big blemish, bruised and browned and gnarly.  Egg-shaped, orange-fleshed, and tasty, yes, but easy on the eyes, not really.  To eat a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">nefle<\/span>, you first peel back its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/476892642\/\">thin, translucent skin<\/a>, starting from the \u201cbutt\u201d end of the fruit.  Then you dig your thumbs into said end and, holding your hands over a plate or sink to catch errant drips of juice, you pry the flesh into halves.  Inside are two smooth, shiny seeds, which you remove and discard.  (They\u2019re poisonous, incidentally, so no fooling around.)  What remains is approximately four bites of flesh with the consistency of ripe summer melon and a perfumed, sweet-tart flavor that can, if you\u2019re not careful, get the salivary glands so worked up that a rivulet of drool shoots down your chin.  It\u2019s smart to keep Kleenexes in your bag if you know there are <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">nefles<\/span> around.<\/p>\n<p>From that lunch forth, we were never without a half-dozen of them at the ready.  I found them at a couple of greengrocers along rue Rambuteau, near the apartment we rented from <a href=\"http:\/\/sublet.lodgis.com\/en\/paris\/liste\/\">this company<\/a>, and at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lagrandeepicerie.fr\/\">La Grande Epicerie de Paris<\/a>, the fancy-pants gourmet wing of Le Bon March\u00e9 department store.   I even bought a bagful to bring home to Brandon.  <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Customs be damned!<\/span>, I thought cheerfully, tucking them into my carry-on.  When they were taken away from me at the U.S. Department of Agriculture scanning station at O\u2019Hare, I actually wept a little.  As I said, it\u2019s smart to keep Kleenexes in your bag if you know there are <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">nefles<\/span> around.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7a472-france2007030-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7a472-france2007030-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5059844360442438882\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>When we weren\u2019t busy downing <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">nefles<\/span>, we were on the chocolate beat.  In the course of a single afternoon, I had us buying bittersweet bars and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">orangettes <\/span>at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidlebovitz.com\/archives\/2005\/10\/patrick_roger_c.html\">Patrick Roger<\/a> and trotting down rue d\u2019Assas to Jean-Charles Rochoux,  where we came away with two <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidlebovitz.com\/archives\/2006\/01\/two_great_taste.html\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">noisette<\/span> bars<\/a> and a sachet of something called <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">durango au gianduja<\/span>. Samples of the latter were offered to us upon arrival, plucked from their bowl with tiny silver tongs by a thoroughly pleasant saleswoman and extended to us on a tiny silver platter.  They looked like petite, hand-rolled truffles, but upon further inspection &#8211; and consumption, with exclamations and moans &#8211; they revealed themselves to be toasted almonds coated in a crackly caramel, enrobed in <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gianduja_%28chocolate%29\">gianduja<\/a>, and rolled in cocoa.  At eight euros per sachet, they were not cheap, but in such situations, I\u2019ve learned, you pony up with no quibbles.  Our supply disappeared so fast that I didn\u2019t even get to photograph them. You\u2019ll have to take my word for it.  We also visited my old <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">coup de coeur<\/span> chocolate shop, A la Petite Fabrique, where the chocolates are not quite so fancy but still plenty fine.  I always snatch up a few of their 85% bars, which come wrapped in red foil, and their 72% bars with whole toasted almonds and hot pink wrapping.  The saleswoman in there is certifiably loony &#8211; although she seems to love me and remembers me (and my mother, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">and<\/span> my sister, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">and<\/span> my ex-boyfriend) every time I come in, even after years away &#8211; so consider yourself warned.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/a7650-france2007031-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/a7650-france2007031-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5059844523651196146\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>When we weren\u2019t chasing chocolate, we were hitting some of my other old favorites.  On Thursday morning, we went to the outdoor market that runs up boulevard Richard Lenoir from Place de la Bastille.  My old vegetable vendor was still there, staffed by the same aimable woman and ruddy-cheeked men. We bought French breakfast radishes, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">gariguette<\/span> strawberries, and a melon and, from the cheese stand across the way, small slices of comt\u00e9 and bleu d\u2019Auvergne and a small, wrinkly goat cheese called a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">crottin de Chavignol<\/span>.  It made a handsome spread on our coffee table and a fine lunch for two.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly every day, we went to Au Levain du Marais, the place I once proudly &#8211; and wishfully &#8211; called <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">my <\/span>boulangerie.  We ate yogurt and fruit in our little kitchenette most mornings, but it wasn\u2019t long before we discovered that a <a href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=chausson%20aux%20pommes&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi\"><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">chausson aux pommes<\/span><\/a> &#8211; a flaky, butter-laminated pastry with a slip of applesauce tucked inside &#8211; makes a great after-breakfast dessert.  We took to buying one on our way out for the day and sharing it on a bench in the Place des Vosges while the morning joggers trotted past, eyeing it covetously.  Sometimes we\u2019d pick up baguette sandwiches too, and stick them in our bags for lunch.  Mom is a die-hard fan of the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">crudit\u00e9s<\/span> sandwich, the one with hard-boiled egg, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise, although she also made quick work once of a variety with thyme-roasted chicken.  I like the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">jambon-beurre-fromage<\/span>, the classic combination of ham, butter, and cheese shown a few photographs up.  I also won\u2019t refuse the one with a few wedges of camembert and a big smear of butter.  Au Levain du Marais does them just right, with a baguette that\u2019s crisp but not too shattery and a thin layer of filling that stretches from end to end.  They also do a lovely little quiche, about 4 inches in diameter, with a filling of spinach or ham.  They\u2019ll wrap it in paper for you and tuck it in a plastic bag, and with half a baguette, it makes a perfect lunch in the park.  I know, because we ate them one day under a tree in the Jardin du Luxembourg, and it was so tasty that I didn\u2019t even care when a policeman came along, blowing his whistle and yelling, to swat us off the grass.<\/p>\n<p>We also, of course, made sure to get our fill of those frilly, precise sorts of pastries that Europe is so famous for. First there was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pierreherme.com\/index.cgi?&amp;cwsid=6551ph551FCE59ph6516235\">Pierre Herm<span>\u00e9<\/span><\/a>, where we came away with my favorites: an Ispahan and a Plaisir Sucr<span>\u00e9<\/span> &#8211; one of his signature creations, two pink <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">macaron <\/span>biscuits enclosing a pastry cream flavored with rose water and dotted with bits of litchi, with fresh raspberries around the rim &#8211; and a Plaisir Sucr<span>\u00e9<\/span>, a multi-layered confection of milk chocolate mousse, hazelnut <a href=\"http:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/cooking\/how_to\/food_dictionary\/search?query=dacquoise&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0&amp;submit=submit\">dacquoise<\/a>, and hazelnut praline, the remains of which are documented in the first photograph of this post.  Then there was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.laduree.fr\/\">Ladur<span>\u00e9<\/span>e<\/a>, with its gold leaf and cherubs painted on the ceiling, where we bought a small tarte Tatin and six of their famous <a style=\"font-style:italic;\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Macaron\">macarons<\/a> packed in the most precious little pastry box I\u2019d ever seen.  For the record, the coffee flavor is and always will be my favorite <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">macaron<\/span>.  Brandon had coached me on the merits of the <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">caramel au beurre sal<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u00e9<\/span> &#8211; the salted butter caramel flavor &#8211; before I left, but I have to say, he\u2019s wrong. (Sorry, honey.)<\/p>\n<p>And when all that eating and walking made our feet sore, we plunked down for some caf<span>\u00e9-sitting.  My favorite afternoon spot is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/476977901\/\">Caf\u00e9 des Phares<\/a>, on Place de la Bastille.  <\/span>I used to live near there, and I spent many an hour reading the newspaper &#8211; or pretending to, anyway &#8211; on its terrace. I\u2019m a shameless people-watcher &#8211; a trait I got from my mom &#8211; and if you\u2019re into that sort of thing, it\u2019s the best spot in town.  Mom and I spent a couple of hours there on our last evening, watching a handsome Italian couple nuzzle and cooling down with some Perrier and then a glass of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/C%C3%B4tes_du_Rh%C3%B4ne\">C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne<\/a>.   Come evening, my favorite caf\u00e9 is Au Petit Fer \u00e0 Cheval, a tiny spot in the heart of the Marais, on rue Vieille du Temple.  It has an old-timey horseshoe bar, Sancerre by the glass, and a terrace compact enough to make for great eavesdropping.  (I\u2019m terrible, people.  You don\u2019t want me sitting at the table next to yours.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/f8471-france2007220-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/f8471-france2007220-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5061606606998824354\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>This is dragging on a bit, I know, but it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to end this treatise without telling you about Bistrot Paul Bert, where we ate dinner twice, on the second and last nights of our trip.  I had read about it in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.epicurious.com\/bonappetit\/features\/survey07_paris\">a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Bon App<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\u00e9<\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;\">tit<\/span> piece by Dorie Greenspan<\/a>, and as you might expect with a recommendation like that, it did not disappoint.  Its 32-euro prix-fixe menu runs from the simplest white asparagus with vinaigrette to marinated squid with preserved lemons, scallops served in their shells with spiced drawn butter, braised pig\u2019s foot with lentils and foie gras, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">dorade<\/span> with fennel confit, a succulent veal steak with fresh morels and cream, a <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">steak frites<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/travel.nytimes.com\/2007\/04\/29\/travel\/29Choice.html\">endorsed by Mark Bittman<\/a>, and, as pictured above and eaten twice by yours truly, a lovely, understated piece of rare tuna with herbs and ratatouille.  For dessert, they make what many consider to be the best <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Paris-Brest<\/span> in town, a ring-shaped pastry filled with chestnut cream, but I fell hard for their \u00eele flottante, a fist-size dollop of poached meringue floating on a sea of cr\u00e8me anglaise.  Take a look at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/487328010\/\">their business card<\/a>, and you\u2019ll get a sense of the spirit of the place.  I think dinner should look like that at least once a week.  That\u2019s me on the left, with the fork, only I wear less eye shadow and a smaller bra size.<\/p>\n<p>The addresses for these places and more are below.
