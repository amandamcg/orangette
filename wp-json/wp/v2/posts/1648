I want to talk about something made of flour, eggs, sugar, and milk, something cooked on top of the stove and served most often with syrup. I want to talk today about pancakes\u2014or, more precisely, <em>leftover<\/em> pancakes. A hot, steaming short stack is nice every now and then, but in my humble opinion, <strong>the best part of a pancake breakfast<\/strong> is the stuff that\u2019s left on the serving platter after everyone has eaten their share.<\/p>\n<p>I discovered this small delight during my years of living alone, when a batch of pancake batter meant <strong>automatic leftovers<\/strong>. Once the little cakes were cool, I would slip them two at a time into sandwich baggies, slip the baggies into a heavy Ziplock bag, and stash them in the freezer. At first, I did it out of necessity\u2014really, who could waste a perfectly good pancake?\u2014but before long, I found myself whipping up batches of batter for the sole purpose of replenishing the supply in the freezer. Apparently, I <em>love <\/em>leftover pancakes.<\/p>\n<p>Frozen, defrosted, or warmed in the toaster oven, it doesn\u2019t really matter, because it\u2019s delicious. Whether plain, with jam, or with peanut butter, the lowly leftover pancake makes a royally satisfying snack at nearly any hour: after work and pre-cocktail, mid-morning, or at midnight. [Given that I\u2019ve expounded at quite some length on <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/05\/how-i-feel-about-brunch.html\">my sentiments toward brunch<\/a>, it should come as no surprise that I eat my pancakes at odd hours.] I\u2019ve been known to eat buttermilk pancakes straight from the baggie, plain and dry and delicious, and I\u2019ll go for a gingerbread pancake straight from the freezer, still hard and icy. But for the last year, my favorite play on the theme has involved JetBlue and leftover <a href=\"http:\/\/saucymag.com\/archives\/2005\/05\/just_as_eating.php\">blueberry buckwheat pancakes<\/a>, which defrost with a lovely, delicate crumb and taste quite spectacular when eaten at the tail end of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/01\/new-year-new-york.html\">a red-eye<\/a>, as the plane swoops down over early-morning Manhattan. <em>That<\/em> is my kind of pancake breakfast.<\/p>\n<p>But now that the days of living alone\u2014and, happily, all those red-eyes\u2014are behind me, a batch of pancake batter doesn\u2019t leave much for the freezer. So when I read a recipe for a Bundt cake whose flavor, the author wrote, is \u201creminiscent of buckwheat pancakes,\u201d you\u2019d better believe that I fired up the oven. Come snack time, <strong>the only thing better than a pancake, I figured, is a slice from a cake that tastes like one<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/07\/Buckwheat_cake.0.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>Luckily for us all, I figured right. As promised, this big, beautiful, wreath-shaped cake has all the toasty, nutty flavor of a buckwheat pancake, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/07\/Buckwheat_cake_blueberry.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/>Impossibly tender and moist, this cake is rich but somehow still light on the tongue, and not too sweet. Its crumb shimmers prettily with moisture from <strong>the buttermilk and the berries<\/strong>, which explode into each bite. It\u2019s about <strong>as close to refreshing as a cake can get<\/strong>, which makes it a very fine snack for a summer afternoon. It\u2019s enough to put my pancake pan out of business\u2014or the leftovers business, at least.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Buckwheat Bundt Cake with Blueberries<br \/><\/strong>Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1400049067\/sr=8-1\/qid=1151990580\/ref=pd_bbs_1\/002-7503642-7804805?ie=UTF8\"><em>Kitchen Sense<\/em><\/a>, by Mitchell Davis<\/p>\n<p>For the purposes of full disclosure, you should know that I received this book as a review copy, free of charge from the publisher. But I liked it enough to make it my nightstand reading for nearly a week\u2014high praise in my house, free book or no\u2014and then to actually cook from it. I had never heard of Mitchell Davis prior to all this, but I liked the feel of his book from the very start. His tone is easy, conversational, and confidence-inspiring\u2014sufficiently so, in fact, to prompt me to bookmark about a dozen recipes. This buckwheat cake makes for a very tasty first foray.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to make the cake as Davis intended, replace the blueberries with \u00be cup chopped toasted walnuts, and be sure to use the orange zest that I have listed as optional below. It brings a fragrant orange note, which is nice but\u2014I think\u2014not entirely necessary.<\/p>\n<p>1 cup buckwheat flour<br \/>1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour<br \/>\u00be cup light brown sugar<br \/>\u00bd tsp kosher salt<br \/>4 tsp baking powder<br \/>\u00bd tsp orange zest, optional<br \/>2 large eggs<br \/>2 cups buttermilk<br \/>6 Tbs unsalted butter, melted and cooled<br \/>\u00bc cup honey<br \/>\u00bd tsp pure vanilla extract<br \/>1 cup fresh blueberries<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and set a rack to the middle position. Grease and flour a standard-size (10- to 12-cup) Bundt pan, and set it aside.<\/p>\n<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the buckwheat flour, all-purpose flour, brown sugar, salt, and baking powder, and whisk to mix well. Add the orange zest, if desired, and whisk to distribute.<\/p>\n<p>In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs to break them up; then add the buttermilk and whisk to mix well. Add the butter, honey, and vanilla, and whisk well. Don\u2019t worry if the honey hardens a bit in the cool liquid; keep stirring, and it will dissolve. Likewise, if the melted butter cools into little shards, don\u2019t fret. Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ones, and stir just to combine. If the melted butter has clumped, whisk very briefly but vigorously to smooth the batter. Do not overmix.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Buckwheat_cake_cut.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/07\/Buckwheat_cake_cut.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Pour 1\/3 of the batter into the prepared pan. Scatter about half of the blueberries over the top. Add another 1\/3 of the batter, and top with the remaining blueberries. Top with the remaining batter. Bake the cake for 25-30 minutes, until the cake rises, pulls away from the edges of the pan, and springs back when pressed gently. Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes before unmolding onto a wire rack to finish cooling completely.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note:<\/em> This cake is even better after it sits for a day or so, which means <em>great <\/em>leftovers. Wrapped airtight and stored at room temperature, it will keep for up to four days. It also freezes well.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today I want to talk about something that I hold very dear, and for once, I don\u2019t mean Brandon.
