That <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2011\/01\/january-30.html\">book proposal<\/a> that I was working on a couple of months ago, it did its job. Because of it, I get to write a second book(!!). I\u2019m so excited about it that my eye started twitching uncontrollably this morning, and several hours later, it\u2019s still at it.

The book is tentatively titled <i>Delancey<\/i>, and like my first book, it\u2019s more a story than a cookbook. It\u2019s about a marriage, in a sense: about a man and a woman and <a href=\"http:\/\/delanceyseattle.com\/\">the restaurant<\/a> that they, however uncomfortably, gave birth to. It\u2019s about what we do for the people we love. It\u2019s about growing up. And most of all, it\u2019s about a small business that we made with our own hands, on our own terms, and the community that came with it, a life that I had no idea would be ours.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/a2dcc-543200091.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5591864816612561826\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/a2dcc-543200091.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1061\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/fe629-181700061.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5591864825175348882\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/fe629-181700061.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1576\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d703e-162000041.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5591864808264426770\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d703e-162000041.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1061\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThe manuscript is due next March, and then, if all goes according to plan, it\u2019ll be published in the spring of 2013.
