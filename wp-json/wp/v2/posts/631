Most days, days when we don\u2019t have house guests, I spend long stretches of time alone, working. I like the quiet. I don\u2019t need a lot of company. But then someone comes into town, or maybe only across town, with a pint of Coffee Heath Bar Crunch and the first season of <i>Mad Men<\/i>, and we squeeze on the couch with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/sets\/72157606225919775\/with\/4756176357\/\">the dog<\/a> who growls because we\u2019ve stolen his spot, and we all know to ignore him because we\u2019ve heard it before, we\u2019ve done this before, many times, and then I realize how much I\u2019ve missed my friends. They wake me up from wherever I\u2019ve been.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/64b81-polabenbreakfast-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5579708886926191922\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/64b81-polabenbreakfast-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1281\" height=\"1019\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThis was the scene on Sunday morning, and that\u2019s Ben\u2019s leg there, and the edge of his napkin, after what I believe can only be called a biscuit feed. Ben\u2019s wife Bonnie is out of frame, and Brandon, I believe, had retired to the couch by this point. You will note that there are no biscuits in sight, and that is because we ate them. But you know what biscuits look like. You don\u2019t need a picture.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I like cooking quite as much as breakfast for house guests. Because if they\u2019re sleeping in our house, we\u2019re obviously fond of them, and who better to cook for than the people you\u2019re fond of? Especially at the start of the day, when everyone is still a little soft, before any crap gets in the way. You can hear them coming up the stairs from the guest room-slash-dungeon in the basement, trying to be quiet, and then the shower turns on, and while it runs, you can sneak out of bed and into the kitchen and grind the coffee, boil the water, get started. You might even remember that you bought some very foxy tangelos, real supermodels, stems and leaves still attached, and decide to put them in a bowl on the table. Tangelos go with biscuits. Biscuits go with raspberry jam and a giant vat of honey.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5e066-polabiscuitbreakfast-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5579710333666607938\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5e066-polabiscuitbreakfast-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1282\" height=\"1019\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThe biscuits on the table on Sunday were Marion Cunningham\u2019s, of course, because that\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2011\/01\/and-try-to-be-cheerful.html\">how I\u2019m doing things this year<\/a>. This woman is teaching me so much! Like that cream biscuits are virtually impossible to mess up. Impossible! Even if you, like me, become convinced that you messed up the recipe and want to throw away the dough without even baking it and your husband and house guests have to talk you down by promising to eat said biscuits, no matter how bad they are. Which they aren\u2019t. They\u2019re outstanding.<\/p>\n<p>Cunningham says that these biscuits belong in your permanent recipe file, and she is right about that. I\u2019ve tried a lot of biscuit recipes, and this is my new go-to, easy. It is not for those seeking a light breakfast &#8211; the amount of cream and butter is, shall we say, <i>festive<\/i> &#8211; but it feels light going down, if that makes any difference. And it\u2019s an epic biscuit: perfectly salted, tender-crumbed, so flaky that you can pull it apart in fine, lacy sheets.<\/p>\n<p>I can say all of this, and I\u2019m actually pretty sure I didn\u2019t even make them quite right. I don\u2019t think I used enough cream &#8211; the amount called for is a range &#8211; and so my dough felt tough and heavy, and by the time I started to worry, I had already worked it too much to go back and add more cream. The biscuits looked puny going into the oven. Very sad, flat, unpromising pucks. But then! In the heat of the oven, they puffed to about three times their original height, and maybe even <i>four<\/i>. Yeow. What I\u2019m trying to say is, you can\u2019t screw this up. No one can screw this up. And first thing in the morning, that &#8211; that, and the company of a few favorite faces &#8211; might be the most a person can hope for.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Cream Biscuits<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\"> Adapted from <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBreakfast-Book-Marion-Cunningham%2Fdp%2F0394555295&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">The Breakfast Book<\/a><\/i>, by Marion Cunningham<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2011-03-04T08:53:00-05:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/631?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>These are terrific with jam or, of course, honey.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 cups all-purpose flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tsp. table salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 Tbsp. baking powder\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tsp. sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 to 1 \u00bd cups heavy cream\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            5 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.
