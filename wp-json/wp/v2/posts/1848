Unusual combination, but it went down plenty easily. We also split a plate of <strong>grilled sardines on a bed of dandelion greens with fennel, pine nuts, and capers<\/strong>. Few things are better than fresh sardines. The skin is perhaps best, crunchy from the heat of the grill. We then moved on to a country pork pat\u00e9 with candied walnuts and other condiments I can\u2019t recall, along with Roquefort and <strong>crispy pork confit<\/strong> and cornichons.

My newish shirt from 0044 is so sexy, although I have now managed to drip some sort of <strong>greasy food substance <\/strong>on it yet again. It must emit some kind of electromagnetic field that captures any and all vinaigrette molecules within close proximity.
