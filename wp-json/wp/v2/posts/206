The idea was to serve the curd next to a pile of sugar cookies, and then your guests could &#8220;frost&#8221; their own cookies. She tried it. I remember ducking through the living room at some point during the party, noticing the stack of cookies and beside it a bowl of curd, creamy yellow with shards of green zest. I grabbed a cookie on the way up to my room, smeared it with as much lime curd as I could fit onto the edge of a knife, and wished, for the rest of the night, that I had taken two.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/63817-9f7a0943-31.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1066\" height=\"1600\" class=\"size-full wp-image-267 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/63817-9f7a0943-31.jpg\" alt=\"63817-9f7a0943-3\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/63817-9f7a0943-31.jpg 1066w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/63817-9f7a0943-31-333x500.jpg 333w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/63817-9f7a0943-31-666x1000.jpg 666w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/63817-9f7a0943-31-870x1306.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1066px) 100vw, 1066px\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\nMy mother has repeated the lime curd \/ sugar cookie trick several times since, always to acclaim. And when I became interested in a few things that were not Trent Reznor*, it was the first curd I ever made. I was intimidated at first, but fruit curd is easy alchemy: a stovetop custard, sort of, but with fruit juice instead of milk. This one isn\u2019t a\u00a0purely\u00a0lime curd &#8211; it uses both lemon and lime juices, plus lime zest &#8211; but it nails it. It\u2019s undoubtedly\u00a0<i>lime<\/i>, fruity and fragrant, but the lemon helps to perk it up, to cut the sugar, eggs, and butter with added acidity. It\u2019s an ideal texture for frosting a cookie, or for filling a cake, or folding into whipped cream to make a mousse.<\/p>\n<p>That said, I don\u2019t make it as often as I should, but that\u2019s only because of my own biases: when I think of sweets, I think of chocolate first and citrus later. But it came to mind recently, when Matthew and I were brainstorming a forthcoming\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Spilled Milk<\/a> episode on limes, so I made a batch. And when it tasted as good as I remembered, I took it to a book club meeting &#8211; some of us\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/delanceyseattle.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Delancey<\/a>\u00a0ladies have banded together to read books and, apparently, eat lime curd &#8211; along with a box of Walker\u2019s Pure Butter Shortbread Scottie Dogs, and I am pleased to report that we enjoyed it more than Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Pnin-Vladimir-Nabokov\/dp\/0679723412\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Pnin<\/a><\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>* For the record, I still have a thing for &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=c-QnnLudkQA\" target=\"_blank\">The Perfect Drug<\/a>.&#8221; And, as I learned in a <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/reporting\/2012\/12\/17\/121217fa_fact_wilkinson\" target=\"_blank\">New Yorker<\/a><\/i> profile, Reznor is a better dog owner than I am, because he actually remembers to brush his dog\u2019s teeth.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Lime Curd<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Gourmets-America-Gourmet-Magazine-Editors\/dp\/0679435638\/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=ur2&tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Gourmet\u2019s America<\/a><\/i><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2014-02-17T06:12:00-05:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/206?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n      <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 large eggs, beaten\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 stick (113 grams) unsalted butter, diced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd cup (100 grams) sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 Tbsp. lime zest\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 Tbsp. freshly squeezed lemon juice\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 Tbsp. freshly squeezed lime juice\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            A pinch of salt          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Combine all ingredients in a saucepan \u2013 I used a 2-quart \u2013 and set it over medium-low heat.

As it thickens, you\u2019re looking for it to hold the mark of the whisk, and if you lift the whisk, the mixture should hold its shape when it plops back into the pot.
