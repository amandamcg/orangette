In truth, I pointed out, I only cook two or three &#8220;real&#8221; dishes a week &#8211; and by &#8220;real,&#8221; which is a very arbitrary word, I mean things that involve more than 10 minutes in the kitchen.

I can\u2019t remember the last time I made a meal that involved three different, recipe-based dishes on a plate. \u00a0Most of the time, my home cooking is very simple and quick: scrambled eggs and a salad dressed in the vinaigrette I always keep in the fridge, a bowl of soup with some cheese and bread or crackers, or rice topped with whatever\u2019s in the crisper drawer and a fried egg and hot sauce.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5feda-_f7a40761.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5feda-_f7a40761.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>Later, when I was sitting at a table, signing books, someone expressed surprise that I &#8220;cook&#8221; so little &#8211; that, for someone who professes to love cooking, that I don\u2019t actually do a lot of it. I sort of bumbled through an answer, and a week later, in the wake of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewednesdaychef.com\/the_wednesday_chef\/2014\/10\/on-cooking-for-others.html\" target=\"_blank\">much online discussion about domesticity, feminism, and the joys and headaches of home cooking<\/a>, I\u2019m still thinking about how to explain my thinking. \u00a0But I think what it comes down to is this: maybe we\u2019re setting our standards too high for what it means to cook at home, to do <i>home cooking<\/i>? I mean, I love to cook, but I also believe it is totally okay &#8211; even good, even great, even <i>elegant<\/i> &#8211; to serve scrambled eggs for dinner. I have no qualms about feeding myself, my child, and my husband (and even company) a pot of vegetable soup that I made earlier this week, with some cheddar and purchased bread. I love to cook, but like everybody, my life is full. I\u2019m tired at night. I hate deveining shrimp. I love to cook, but I love to cook two or three times a week, and not much more than that. The rest of the time, we eat leftovers, or we eat something that I (or we) can make in a few minutes. It\u2019s still home cooking, and we\u2019re still eating good food, and there\u2019s real pleasure in that. That\u2019s what I care about.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/09fe0-_f7a40951.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/09fe0-_f7a40951.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<p>This soup is one that I\u2019ve made probably a half-dozen times, adapted from a recipe that I found last year in <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bonappetit.com\/recipe\/carrot-coconut-soup\" target=\"_blank\">Bon Appetit<\/a><\/i>. You\u2019ve got to peel and chop the bag of carrots, but after that, the soup coasts to the finish line by itself, and a single batch will cover a week\u2019s worth of lunches or a couple of dinners for a small family. The photos I took of it were sort of lackluster, but you can picture it. The soup is anything but. It\u2019s pumpkin-orange and velvety, laced with a creeping heat that leaves your mouth tingling.
