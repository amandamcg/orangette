And sometimes, those some days are every day, especially when they fall near the end of June, and when the thermometer outside is stuck at the \u201chot and sticky\u201d mark, and when you\u2019ve been in the process of moving into a new apartment for, oh, the past <em>ten<\/em> of them. Around here, those are the kinds of days that we\u2019ve been having. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldwidewords.org\/qa\/qa-sal1.htm\">Salad days<\/a>, or sort of.<\/p>\n<p>Regular readers will know by this point that Brandon and I eat <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/01\/new-year-new-york.html\">a lot<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/04\/spring-sliced-and-straight-from-bowl.html\">of salad<\/a>. Between the two of us, we could keep a small farm in business. The first meal that we ever shared was a salad\u2014of shredded baby bok choy, ramp leaves, and avocado, to be precise, with a baguette and a disk of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cowgirlcreamery.com\/cheeses\/\">Mt. Tam<\/a> on the side\u2014and since then, it\u2019s become a regular habit. Most of the time, in fact, <strong>we don\u2019t so much cook together as <em>assemble<\/em><\/strong><em>.<\/em> This could be a bit disconcerting for two people who claim to be decent cooks, but really, it\u2019s not bad. Come summer, food is best with minimal fussing, anyway, and no matter the time of year, <strong>a good salad is nothing to scoff at<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>So for the past several days, we\u2019ve been letting our salad tendency run amok. Since the night of Brandon\u2019s arrival, we\u2019ve been busy moving into a new apartment\u2014or a little house, really, with an office for me and a workbench for him\u2014and in our honor, Seattle has pulled out all the stops where sunshine is concerned. It\u2019s a blessing, I guess, but of the very mixed variety: <strong>it\u2019s been h &#8211; o &#8211; t hot<\/strong>, all-caps HOT, no air-conditioning hot, hot as in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000046PUT\/ref=m_art_li_2\/103-6466831-7339012?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=5174\">Kool &amp; The Gang\u2019s \u201cToo Hot.\u201d<\/a> I mean <em>hot.<\/em> It\u2019s sweaty, dirty, nasty stuff, even before all the boxes and the bags and the dust. It\u2019s <strong>the sort of thing that screams for salad and beer<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Romaine_salad.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/06\/Romaine_salad.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>And so we answer\u2014or rather, Brandon does. While I open the beers and set the table, he starts to work on a salad that, he tells me, has been a standby in his repertoire for a while. It could hardly be simpler: chopped romaine, cherry tomatoes, a palmful of paper-thin red onion slices, and a crumbled chunk of Greek feta. The dressing, too, couldn\u2019t be easier\u2014just lime juice, olive oil, garlic, and salt\u2014but from there, it\u2019s alchemy. What results is <strong>bright, kicky, and laced with garlic<\/strong>, a spark to liven up romaine\u2019s cool, watery crunch.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Romaine_salad_close.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/06\/Romaine_salad_close.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>All told, a bowl of this stuff is almost as refreshing as a dip in the pool: cold, a little puckery, now-creamy, now-crisp. And with only minimal assembly required, it\u2019s the IKEA bookshelf of the salad world, you could say. Trust me, after the past few days, I know plenty about both.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Summer Romaine Salad with Lime-Garlic Dressing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not normally a fan of romaine, but this salad has made me reconsider. Put together the light, bright crunch of romaine with the light, bright flavor of a lime-based dressing, and you\u2019ve got a proverbial match made in heaven. To this, you could add nearly anything, but we keep it simple with a few halved cherry tomatoes, some red onion, and a handful of tangy feta. It\u2019s a stripped-down, slightly tweaked Greek salad of sorts, but better: cool, easy, and just the thing for a hot summer night.<\/p>\n<p><em>For dressing:<\/em><br \/>3 Tbs plus 1 tsp fresh lime juice<br \/>5 Tbs good-tasting olive oil<br \/>\u00bc tsp minced garlic<br \/>1\/8 tsp fine sea salt<\/p>\n<p><em>For salad:<\/em><br \/>Romaine lettuce, washed, dried, and cut with a chef\u2019s knife into rough \u00bd-inch strips<br \/>Cherry or grape tomatoes, halved<br \/>Slivered red onion<br \/>Greek feta<\/p>\n<p>First, make the dressing. In a small bowl or jar, combine the lime juice, olive oil, garlic, and salt. Whisk until emulsified, and set aside.<\/p>\n<p>In a salad bowl, combine romaine, cherry tomatoes, and red onion in whatever proportions you like. Toss with dressing to taste, and top with plenty of feta. Serve.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note:<\/em> Dressing keeps, covered and chilled, for up to a week. <\/p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some days, you just want a salad.
