The executive pastry chef was also a David, a charming, double-dimpled guy named <a href=\"http:\/\/www.damgoodsweet.com\/about\/david-guas.html\">David Guas<\/a>, and for the grand opening party, he made caramel corn. I remember very clearly standing in the dining room, just outside the kitchen, when a waiter came through the crowd with a platter covered in small white paper trays, the kind that fries come in at concession stands, or maybe it was actually white paper cones, or maybe I don\u2019t remember that night so well at all, but the trays, or the cones, were filled with caramel corn. It was eerily light, crisp and snappy, sweet-salty, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">insane<\/span>. It was this caramel corn.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ff9bc-polacaramelcorn-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5414186986286458210\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ff9bc-polacaramelcorn-11.jpg?w=298\" alt=\"\" width=\"1214\" height=\"1222\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nMost commercial caramel corns, or the specimens I\u2019ve tasted, at least, don\u2019t really taste like caramel. They only taste sweet. This one tasted like true caramel. It tasted like butter and brown sugar and heat &#8211; and, crucially, a little bit of salt. It was also studded with salted peanuts. I wanted to ask if he would share the recipe, but I had only met him once or twice, and I didn\u2019t want to seem pushy. My brother told me that they planned to serve the caramel corn as a mignardise, a little sweet something sent out with the check, so I contented myself with the thought that, whenever I ate at Ceiba, a little paper tray of it, or cone of it, would be waiting for me at the end of my meal.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, Ceiba is approximately 2,700 miles from where I live. In the six years since it opened, I have eaten there exactly twice. There has been very little caramel corn in my life. And David Guas, for his part, moved on a couple of years ago, starting his own <a href=\"http:\/\/www.damgoodsweet.com\/\">consulting company<\/a> and helping restaurants across the country develop dessert menus. I mourned my lost opportunity. In my next life, I vowed, I would be pushier.<\/p>\n<p>But as luck would have it, he has just come out with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDamGoodSweet-Desserts-Satisfy-Sweet-Orleans%2Fdp%2F1600851185%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1260498593%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">a cookbook<\/a>, and in it, on page 154, is the caramel corn. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hellooooo<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0f215-poladeepspacecaramelcorn1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5414184929198927522\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0f215-poladeepspacecaramelcorn1.jpg?w=298\" alt=\"\" width=\"1212\" height=\"1222\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nIf you\u2019ve been around here for any length of time, you may remember that, for four Christmases in a row now, I\u2019ve been trying to give only homemade or handmade gifts. I make and give away tins of cookies and candies, and when I do shop, I buy mainly from artists and crafters, at places like <a href=\"http:\/\/abbytryagain.bigcartel.com\/\">this<\/a>, or <a href=\"http:\/\/sandrajuto.bigcartel.com\/\">this<\/a>, or <a href=\"http:\/\/port2portpress.com\/home.htm\">this<\/a>, or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplyphoto.bigcartel.com\/\">this<\/a>, or <a href=\"http:\/\/uniformnatural.bigcartel.com\/\">this<\/a>. It makes me feel good. I also buy books, because I can\u2019t imagine <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">not<\/span> buying books. But mostly I bake or make candy, and what I\u2019m trying to say is: a couple of weeks ago, I drew up a long list of items to make for this year\u2019s tins, but I cannot bring myself to start making them, because I CANNOT STOP MAKING CARAMEL CORN.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is, it\u2019s easy. And quick. You pop some popcorn, and then you put it into a bowl. You make a caramel, and you cook it to 250 degrees. You quickly dump the hot caramel over the popcorn, and then you fold it in as well as you can, and then you add salted peanuts. Then comes the clincher: you bake it for one hour in a low oven. Not all caramel corn recipes include this step, but I think it\u2019s the deal-sealer. In the oven, the caramel, which had started to harden as you stirred it into the popcorn, gets a chance to soften again. You can now stir it into the popcorn more easily and evenly. The whole, gooey mess will crisp spectacularly as it cools, and the kitchen will smell outrageous, and then you will turn into Edward Cullen. I\u2019m so sorry.<\/p>\n<p>One last thing: don\u2019t be upset if the peanuts don\u2019t seem to want to stay mixed in with the popcorn. Heaven is the handful of caramel-coated peanuts left in the container after the popcorn is gone.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Caramel Corn with Salted Peanuts<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDamGoodSweet-Desserts-Satisfy-Sweet-Orleans%2Fdp%2F1600851185%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1260498593%26sr%3D1-1&tag=orangette-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">DamGoodSweet<\/span><\/a>, by David Guas and Raquel Pelzel<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2009-12-13T07:27:00-05:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/917?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>A few notes to help you along:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The original version of this recipe calls for microwave popcorn. I used Newman\u2019s Own brand microwave popcorn in the \u201cnatural\u201d flavor. However, I don\u2019t see any reason why you couldn\u2019t use stovetop or air-popped popcorn, if you\u2019d like. You\u2019ll need 10 cups of it, and you\u2019ll probably want to salt it lightly, since almost all microwave popcorns have at least a little bit of added salt.<br \/>\n&#8211; Be sure to have a whisk and a rubber spatula close at hand. You\u2019ll need them both on short notice.<br \/>\n&#8211; Before you begin cooking the caramel, measure out the baking soda and the vanilla, and chop the peanuts. You won\u2019t have time to do it later.<br \/>\n&#8211; Do not try to make this recipe without a candy thermometer.<br \/>\n&#8211; If you plan to give this popcorn as a gift, know that it looks very handsome, and keeps nicely, in a Mason jar.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 (3\u00bd-ounce) package plain (unbuttered natural flavor) microwave popcorn, or about 10 cups fresh popcorn popped by any method, lightly salted\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 cup packed light brown sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bc cup light corn syrup\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bc tsp. salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd tsp. baking soda\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tsp. vanilla extract\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 cup lightly salted peanuts, roughly chopped          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Preheat the oven to 250\u00b0F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.<\/p>\n<p>If using microwave popcorn, pop the popcorn according to the package instructions. Coat a large mixing bowl with nonstick cooking spray, and dump the popcorn into the bowl, taking care to pick out and discard any unpopped kernels.<\/p>\n<p>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the brown sugar, corn syrup, butter, salt, and 2 tablespoons of water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Continue to simmer, whisking often, until the mixture reads 250\u00b0F on a candy thermometer, about 3 to 4 minutes. Immediately remove the pan from the heat, and whisk in the baking soda and vanilla. Quickly pour the hot caramel over the popcorn. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the caramel into the popcorn, taking care to distribute it as evenly as you can. Stir in the peanuts, and transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 1 hour, stirring and turning the popcorn with a spatula every 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, and place on a cooling rack for 20 minutes. Gently break up the popcorn, and serve.<\/p>\n<p>Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days (or thereabouts).<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 10 cups<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have wanted this caramel corn recipe for a very long time.
