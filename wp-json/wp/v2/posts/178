And now here I am, in the thick of it, seeing my everyday &#8211; and my cooking, because it\u2019s the anchor of my days &#8211; through the lens of this very different life. So I\u2019m feeling it out, I guess: how to write now, how to write in a way that Old Me wouldn\u2019t be totally bored and annoyed with, while acknowledging that New Me is&#8230; a new me. I like the new me better than the old one, in ways that I never expected: I had no idea I could be so <i>patient<\/i>! Able to read the same book fifteen times without screaming! Willing to walk around with chewed-up graham cracker smeared on my coat! I also never expected to spend so much time thinking about applesauce, and more to the point, Judy Rodgers\u2019s roasted applesauce.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/509b6-9f7a18501.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/509b6-9f7a18501.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I\u2019ve written about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zunicafe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Zuni Caf\u00e9<\/a> at least a half-dozen times on this site, which strikes me as a lot for someone who grew up in Oklahoma and lives in Seattle. But because my mother\u2019s twin sister <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2012\/06\/she-felt-like-cheering.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tina<\/a> lived near San Francisco, where Zuni is, and because I spent a lot of time at Tina\u2019s house as a kid, a teenager, and in college, I got to eat at Zuni Caf\u00e9 a few times in my formative years, and I do think it <i>formed<\/i>, and <i>informed<\/i> me. Judy Rodgers\u2019s cooking was simple, seasonal, understated, and somehow also bold, the flavors so spot-on, so confident, that they made a deep impression. In a lot of ways, <i>The Zuni Caf\u00e9 Cookbook\u00a0<\/i>taught me how to cook. You can imagine then, how thoroughly I had my mind blown out of my head when, four years ago, after I wrote about her <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2010\/02\/reasonable-question.html\" target=\"_blank\">polenta<\/a>, Rodgers (Judy? Can I call her Judy?) sent me an e-mail. (!!!!) She <a href=\"http:\/\/insidescoopsf.sfgate.com\/blog\/2013\/12\/03\/judy-rodgers-of-zuni-cafe-dies\/\" target=\"_blank\">passed away<\/a> last December, but it makes me happy to know that June will eat in her restaurant someday, and that she\u2019s growing up eating Rodgers\u2019s excellent applesauce.<\/p>\n<p><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7ad2a-414100211.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/7ad2a-414100211.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"424\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s basically impossible to make anything elaborate for breakfast when June is around. And that\u2019s fine, really, because I was a cold-cereal person long before she showed up. So cold cereal it often is! Or, if I was a superhero the night before and made a batch of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2014\/01\/a-good-person-to-know.html\" target=\"_blank\">oatmeal<\/a>, we\u2019ll have oatmeal. Or, if I was a superhero a few nights before and made oatmeal, so that I could later be a superhero and make <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2014\/01\/the-right-buttons.html\" target=\"_blank\">leftover oatmeal muffins<\/a>, we\u2019ll have leftover oatmeal muffins. And if not, I try to at least make sure there\u2019s applesauce and plain yogurt.<\/p>\n<p>I live in a state of many apples, so, I don\u2019t know, I got into the habit of making applesauce. It feels wrong to buy it at the store when I can get good fruit at the market on Sunday and turn it into applesauce in barely half an hour. For a long time, I used a stovetop method (much like the one in <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2006\/02\/lost-and-found.html\" target=\"_blank\">this ancient post<\/a>), and sometimes I added half a vanilla bean, which I like a lot. \u00a0But then Kristen Miglore, the genius behind Food52\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/food52.com\/blog\/category\/128-genius-recipes\" target=\"_blank\">Genius Recipes<\/a> column, wrote about <a href=\"http:\/\/food52.com\/blog\/2693-judy-rodgers-roasted-applesauce-and-savory-apple-charlottes\" target=\"_blank\">Judy Rodgers\u2019s roasted applesauce<\/a>. Like most of Rodgers\u2019s recipes, this one is dead-simple, but all about the details. It\u2019s just apples, sugar, salt, and butter (and maybe apple cider vinegar, though I haven\u2019t needed it yet), and the sugar amount is much lower than other recipes I\u2019ve used, because oven-roasting helps to concentrate the apples\u2019 sweetness. You peel and quarter them, toss them with a tiny bit of sugar and a tinier bit of salt, dot them with butter, and you\u2019re mostly done. (The only tricky part, if you can call it that, is seasoning the apples, because you\u2019ll do it to taste: you might use one teaspoon, or you might use two. As tricky parts go, it\u2019s not tricky.) In the oven, the apples soften and caramelize at their tips, and they also dry out slightly, which I like, because it makes for a pleasingly chunky sauce, one that June can eat with her hands, if that\u2019s how the morning is going.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, making applesauce is one of those brainless tasks that I can do once a week, while having a glass of something after June is in bed and before we are in bed, and the next morning, when I hear her through the earplugs and the pillow and the sleep, I feel good for having done it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Judy Rodgers's Roasted Applesauce<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">From the Zuni Cafe Cookbook and Kristen Miglore\u2019s Genius Recipes<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2014-04-07T04:08:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/178?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n      <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 \u00bd to 4 pounds apples (Rodgers uses crisp eating apples, like Braeburns, Pippins, or Galas; I used Pink Ladies)\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Pinch of salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 to 2 teaspoons sugar, or to taste\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into slivers\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            A splash of apple cider vinegar, optiona          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Preheat the oven to 375 F.<\/p>\n<p>Peel, core, and quarter the apples. Put them in a (ungreased) baking dish just large enough to hold them in a crowded single layer. (I find that a 9&#215;13 dish is perfect.) Toss with a little salt and 1 teaspoon of the sugar. (Unless they are very sweet, in which case you might not need any sugar at all.) If they are tart enough to make you squint, use 2 teaspoons of sugar. Dot the apples with butter, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake until the apples start to soften, about 15 to 30 minutes. Remove the foil, raise the heat to 500 F, and return the pan to the oven. Leave the apples to dry out and color slightly, about 10 minutes more. When the tips of the apples are golden and the fruit is tender, remove the pan from the oven, and coarsely mash the apples. (You could use a potato masher, but I just use the back of a wooden spoon, and I leave mine very chunky.) \u00a0If you like, season the applesauce further with salt and sugar to taste, and then consider a splash of apple cider vinegar to brighten the flavor. (You can try a drop on a spoonful to see if you like it; I haven\u2019t found that my applesauce needs it.)<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: about 3 cups<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>June has mastered a new word, and that word is eat.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of many things I like about her.
