(And so, I should note, has <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Friday_Night_Lights_(TV_series)\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Friday Night Lights<\/i><\/a>, which I just finished. \u00a0I miss\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tim_Riggins\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Riggins<\/a>\u00a0already. \u00a0I\u2019m not proud to have fallen for the brooding-hunk routine,\u00a0but I\u2019m willing to own it. \u00a0I would also be willing, for the record, to watch an entire hour of close-ups of Taylor Kitsch\u2019s lips, if the producers of the show ever decide to make a Best of Tim Riggins\u2019s Makeout Scenes DVD.)<\/p>\n<p>In any case, I was doing some research the other day, looking up granola bar recipes for a forthcoming <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Spilled Milk<\/a> episode. \u00a0When I came across one on <a href=\"http:\/\/smittenkitchen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Smitten Kitchen<\/a>, it leapt out at me &#8211; not only because it made a chewy granola bar, which I like, and because it came from Deb, who knows her way around a kitchen, but mostly because I loved the no-nonsense ingredients: oats, nuts, nut butter, dried fruits, butter, honey, and very little else. \u00a0The list of ingredients resonated with much of what I\u2019ve been reading in Planck\u2019s book, and that sealed the deal. \u00a0I decided to try it. \u00a0Of course, I did add chocolate. \u00a0Let\u2019s be clear about that.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

which she, in turn, adapted from King Arthur Flour &#8211; but I tailored the flavorings to suit my tastes. \u00a0For a nut, I used pecans, because I like them in granola. \u00a0I also threw in some big flakes of coconut. \u00a0And some dried cherries, though only a few. \u00a0(I don\u2019t like a lot of fruit in my granola.) \u00a0And the chocolate. \u00a0I grew up on packaged granola bars with chocolate chips, and you know how I\u2019ve come to feel about <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/03\/all-we-ever-really-want-to-do.html\" target=\"_blank\">granola with chocolate<\/a>, so it felt natural to throw in some chocolate chips that had been kicking around in the cupboard. \u00a0I didn\u2019t bother to chop anything, not even the pecan halves, and I was glad for it later. \u00a0I liked all the lumps and bumps. \u00a0The whole process took less than an hour, most of which was oven time, and 72 hours later, only a couple of bars are left. \u00a0Brandon has been eating them for breakfast, and I took two to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootsandgrubs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew<\/a>, and you can figure out the rest. \u00a0I\u2019m already planning another batch.<\/p>\n<p>\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Chewy Granola Bars with Pecans, Chocolate, and Cherries<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <a href=\"http:\/\/smittenkitchen.com\/2010\/02\/thick-chewy-granola-bars\/\" target=\"_blank\">Smitten Kitchen<\/a><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2012-05-04T23:52:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/403?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>For my first go at this recipe, I used \u00bd cup (100 grams) sugar. \u00a0That amount yielded a balanced, mildly sweet bar, but whenever I got a bite with cherries or chocolate, I wished that the base mixture were even a little less sweet. \u00a0Next time, I\u2019ll try cutting the sugar back to 1\/3 cup (67 grams). \u00a0Oh, and I should tell you that I used unrefined cane sugar. \u00a0Like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Wholesome-Sweetners-Organic-Milled-Unrefined\/dp\/B005TY1OH0\" target=\"_blank\">this<\/a>. \u00a0It\u2019s what we use at Delancey, and over the past year, I\u2019ve been using it more and more at home. \u00a0I find it to be 100% interchangeable with regular white sugar.<\/p>\n<p>Also, I might leave out the cinnamon next time. \u00a0Maybe. \u00a0It\u2019s nice, but there\u2019s already a lot of good stuff going on in here.<\/p>\n<p>For chocolate, I used Ghirardelli 60% chocolate chips, but you could chop up and use any chocolate you like, preferably bittersweet. \u00a0And if you\u2019re confused by the thought of coconut chips, as I\u2019ve been in the past, they\u2019re the big, flat flakes.

Cut a rectangle of parchment paper to line the bottom and two sides of the dish, leaving a little overhang. \u00a0Press the parchment paper into the dish. \u00a0Lightly grease the parchment paper.<\/p>\n<p>Put\u00a01\/3 cup (30 to 35 grams) of the quick-cooking oats in the bowl of a food processor. \u00a0Process until finely ground.<\/p>\n<p>In a large bowl, stir together the remaining 1 2\/3 cup oats, ground oats, sugar, pecans, coconut chips, chocolate chips, dried cherries, salt, and, if using, cinnamon.<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, vanilla extract, melted butter, honey, and water. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients, and stir well, until the mixture is evenly moistened. Transfer to the prepared pan, pressing the mixture firmly to ensure that it molds to the shape of the pan. (A piece of plastic wrap helps: just lay it over the pan before you begin pressing. \u00a0Much less stickiness.)<\/p>\n<p>Bake the bars for about 30 minutes, or until they\u2019re brown around the edges and just beginning to color on top, too. \u00a0(I set a timer for 25 minutes and began checking on them at that point, and I was surprised to find that they were already browning at the edges. \u00a0I left them in, however, for another 5 minutes or so, until the tops had a hint of color.) \u00a0The mixture will still seem soft and almost underbaked if you press on it, but it\u2019ll set as it cools.<\/p>\n<p>Transfer the pan to a rack, and allow the bars to cool completely in the pan. \u00a0When cool, run a sharp knife along the edges of the pan; then pull up on the parchment paper to lift the sheet of bars out of the pan. \u00a0Cut the bars into squares. \u00a0Or, heck, rectangles. \u00a0Whatever you want.<\/p>\n<p><i>Note<\/i>: \u00a0I let my bars cool for a number of hours, and they cut very neatly, but I noticed that some commenters on Deb\u2019s post mentioned issues with crumbling. \u00a0Here\u2019s what she suggested: \u00a0If your bars seem crumbly, refrigerate them in the pan for 30 minutes to further set them, and then try cutting them while cold.<\/p>\n<p><i>Another note<\/i>: I stored my bars on a cutting board wrapped in plastic wrap, but if you\u2019d like to put them in an airtight container, consider layering them between sheets of wax paper, so they don\u2019t stick to one another. \u00a0In hot weather, you might need to refrigerate them.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 16 squares<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n<br \/>\n<b><\/b><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My manuscript is due on June 1. \u00a0Hello from the Cave &#8211; or, as I first typed, &#8220;Hell from the Cave,&#8221; which has a nice slasher-movie ring to it. \u00a0Hi.
