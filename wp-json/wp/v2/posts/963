It came up easily enough. We\u2019re really very close. And we still seem to remember how to cook, which is promising, since that\u2019s the whole point.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/b162c-polaitalpars1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5360792563682628930\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/b162c-polaitalpars1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1590\" height=\"1588\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nAbout ten days ago, we held a private dinner at Delancey. The evening was a collaboration with our friends Olaiya and John, part of a series of charity dinners that they organize and host under the name <a href=\"http:\/\/bealittlespark.blogspot.com\/\">Little Spark<\/a>, with proceeds going to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.womenforwomen.org\/\">Women for Women International<\/a>. It was our first time cooking for paying guests, and needless to say, there was a certain amount of terror involved. And a lot of excitement. And adrenaline. If you were there, I was the crazy lady in yellow rubber gloves, standing at the dishwasher until 1 am, grinning like an idiot at the empty plates.<\/p>\n<p>Dinner was served family-style, and the focus of the evening was pizza, but we served a full three-course menu, starting with wood oven-roasted vegetables and ending with chocolate chip cookies with sea salt and housemade ice cream. Everything but the pizza was mine to do. I went to the farmers\u2019 market the day before &#8211; though once we open, we\u2019ll be buying from a couple of local farms who deliver, as well as a produce distributor who works with other local farms &#8211; and bought what looked good: bundles of small carrots, the freshest broccoli I\u2019d ever seen, bags of small yellow potatoes, and a fat bunch of parsley. I wanted to keep it simple. So I cut the broccoli into florets and tossed them with olive oil, salt, ground cumin, and ground coriander. (A lot like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thewednesdaychef.com\/the_wednesday_chef\/2009\/01\/melissa-clarks-roasted-broccoli-with-shrimp.html\">this<\/a>, actually, minus the shrimp.) When they came out of the oven, the florets were charred in spots, frizzled at their edges, so that they crunched softly &#8211; like water chestnuts, I decided; I <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">love<\/span> water chestnuts &#8211; between your teeth. We squeezed some lemon over them, and that was it. The carrots were left whole, tossed with olive oil and salt and roasted quickly, so that they caramelized without turning to mush, and then they too got some lemon, along with a splash more olive oil and some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.penzeys.com\/cgi-bin\/penzeys\/p-penzeysaleppopepper.html\">aleppo pepper<\/a>. But what everyone asked about, and what I wanted to tell you about today, was the potatoes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/2e44d-polapotatoesdone1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5361032428928593362\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/2e44d-polapotatoesdone1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1584\" height=\"1590\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThat\u2019s them in the photograph up there: steamed potatoes tossed with salsa verde. But ignore the steamed part. Steamed potatoes are totally fine, but for the dinner, we served them halved lengthwise and roasted, so that they were crispy and browned, delicious even before the salsa verde came along. Either way, however you do it, I am here to tell you to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">make this sauce<\/span>. It\u2019s similar to <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2009\/05\/something-called-sauce-gribiche.html\">sauce gribiche<\/a>, in a sense &#8211; both have parsley, capers, olive oil, and lemon &#8211; but it\u2019s simpler, quicker, easier to bang up if you don\u2019t have an herb garden at your disposal. (Ours was an early casualty of the restaurant. It\u2019s now so far gone that our landlord actually <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">mowed<\/span> it the last time he came over.) If you, like me, tend to buy a bunch of parsley for a recipe and wind up with half of it moping around, festering in your crisper drawer, this is for you.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, you take roughly equal parts capers and Italian parsley, and you moisten them with olive oil and lemon, and then you season it all with some garlic, lemon zest, red pepper flakes, and a couple pinches of salt. I imagine that it might be good on chicken, or some cold leftover steak, but it\u2019s insane on roasted potatoes. If you really mean business, toss it into the potatoes when they\u2019re still hot, and then lean over the bowl while the whole thing opens up and blooms: the tangy capers, the brightness of the lemon, the fragrance of the olive oil, the grassy green parsley. I can smell it just sitting here.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Salsa Verde for Potatoes<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">enough for about 1 \u00bd lb. potatoes<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2009-07-22T03:40:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/963?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>For this recipe, we use capers in brine, and we don\u2019t rinse them after draining. And just so you know, you can multiply this recipe to make a lot at a time, but you\u2019ll want to watch out for the garlic. Its flavor tends to grow exponentially, and it can quickly become overpowering. For large quantities, add garlic to taste.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and just in case of confusion: the term salsa verde is a sort of catch-all used to describe a variety of green herb-based sauces, so if you\u2019ve seen other salsa verde recipes that looked different from this one, that\u2019s why. (For example, there\u2019s a salsa verde in my book that uses cilantro, chiles, and lime juice. Nothing like this one, but pretty killer on roasted cauliflower.)<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            6 Tbsp. olive oil\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 Tbsp. capers, drained and coarsely chopped\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 Tbsp. finely chopped Italian parsley\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 medium garlic cloves, pressed or minced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd tsp. lemon juice\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd tsp. finely grated lemon zest\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1\/8 tsp. kosher salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Pinch of red pepper flakes          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Combine the ingredients in a small bowl, and whisk to mix well.
