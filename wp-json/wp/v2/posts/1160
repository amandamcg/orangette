If my count is correct, this is the sixth, SIXTH, banana bread and\/or cake recipe that I have written about here. Is there some sort of treatment facility for this? A Betty Ford Center for Banana Bread Dependency? I try to stop myself, but I am weak. So weak. Especially when there is honey involved, and when there are crumbly bits of cinnamon sugar on top, and when some of those crumbly bits fall onto the plate and you can press them with the tip of your index finger so that they collect in a sweet, sticky clump, which you can then lift to your mouth and gently, nibblingly, consume. I am so weak about things like that.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t help that, as of sometime last week, the rain has arrived in Seattle. I\u2019m sure that we have a few more sunny days in store before it hunkers down for good, but as I type this, I am wearing two layers and contemplating a pair of socks. I am told that I should complain about this &#8211; I <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">do<\/span> have a couple more <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2008\/08\/also-picnics.html\">picnics<\/a> to squeeze in &#8211; but instead, I feel oddly content. I am almost afraid to say it aloud, but I think this might mean that I\u2019m a Real Seattleite. I am heading into my seventh year here, so I guess it\u2019s about time? That, or I have finally started to forget what it was like to live in places that aren\u2019t overcast for eight months of the year? Either way, on Sunday afternoon, after lunch, when the clouds started to hover and a cold wind galloped in and rain pelted the kitchen windows, I lay down on the couch with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/molly_orangette\/2778942528\/in\/set-72157606225919775\/\">Jack<\/a> and took the best, most peaceful nap <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ever<\/span>. I didn\u2019t even mind when I woke up a little chilled, with the pattern of the upholstery embossed onto my cheek. I think this is a clear sign of fall, don\u2019t you? Not to mention a big green light for banana bread, which, as everybody knows, is what people, and especially people named Molly, are supposed to eat when they wake up from a nap.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/67554-polabananabreadinpan-31.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5238551792785467618\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/67554-polabananabreadinpan-31.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This particular recipe comes, with just a couple of adjustments, from a bakery in Oakland called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bakesalebetty.com\/\">Bakesale Betty<\/a>, via the September issue of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Bon App\u00e9tit<\/span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">.<\/span> I stumbled upon it last Friday night, while I was trying to organize a teetering stack of magazines on the floor next to my desk before some friends arrived for dinner. Organizing magazines, I find, generally requires thumbing through them at least a little, no matter how rushed I am, and so it was that, on page 135, my eyes fell on the words BANANA BREAD WITH CINNAMON CRUMBLE TOPPING. You can well imagine the noisy chorus of bells this set ringing in my head. It was deafening, like finding yourself in a large, echoing cathedral while the organist is rehearsing. I could hardly keep up a conversation, what with that kind of din. Before the evening was through, I had retrieved three frozen bananas from the freezer &#8211; I always keep a stash around &#8211; and put them in the refrigerator to thaw. And on Saturday afternoon, I made banana bread.<\/p>\n<p>The recipe isn\u2019t that different, really, from a classic banana bread, the kind that your mother or aunt or best friend\u2019s mother or whoever used to make. But it\u2019s an exceptionally delicate, tender take on the theme, with honey and cinnamon stirred into the batter to make it more interesting and &#8211; for the clincher &#8211; a generous layer of cinnamon sugar on top, which forms a craggly sort of crust as it bakes. I think it\u2019s my new favorite. In concept, it\u2019s not entirely unlike <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/06\/my-kind-of-bridal.html\">this recipe<\/a>, only where that one is chewy and bread-like and bordering on hearty, this one is daintier and more balanced, closer to cake. That doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that you can\u2019t eat it for breakfast, because you can. (Brandon can vouch for that.) It does mean, however, that it\u2019s especially well-suited to the afternoon &#8211; to after-nap time, for example, on a weekend in late August. Of course, there\u2019s only one of those left, so if I were you, I might go ahead and preheat the oven now.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Banana Bread with Cinnamon Crumble Topping<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from Bakesale Betty and <i>Bon App\u00e9tit<\/i>, September 2008<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2008-08-26T07:11:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1160?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n      <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n              <h3>For bread:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd cups all-purpose flour\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 cup sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tsp. ground cinnamon\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tsp. baking soda\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd tsp. salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 cup mashed ripe banana (about 3 medium bananas)\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 large eggs\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd cup vegetable oil\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bc cup honey\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bc cup water\r          <\/div>\n                      <h3>For topping:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 Tbsp. sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tsp. ground cinnamon\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 \u00bd Tbsp. packed dark brown sugar          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0 F.

Also, because I don\u2019t have a 9- x 5-inch pan &#8211; and because an 8 \u00bd- x 4 \u00bd-inch is a little <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joyofbaking.com\/PanSizes.html\">too small<\/a> &#8211; I used a 10- x 3-inch pan that I found once at a flea market.)<\/p>\n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt.

Sprinkle them evenly over the batter.<\/p>\n<p>Bake the bread until a tester inserted into its center comes out clean, about 1 hour, give or take a little. Cool the bread in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Then carefully remove the bread from the pan, taking care not to dislodge the topping.
