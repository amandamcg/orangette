She did not. We did not. Instead, we ate a bunch of chips and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2016\/06\/the-opposite-of-fancy\/\" target=\"_blank\">dip<\/a>, and I gave June a haircut in the living room with my <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2cn21ma\" target=\"_blank\">Joyce Chen kitchen shears<\/a>\u00a0(sharpest scissors around, FYI),\u00a0and then some of us went up on the roof to watch fireworks and had a serendipitous owl-spotting\u00a0while we were at it.\u00a0A couple of weeks later, with the lemons still sitting on the kitchen counter, I sat down at the computer to search\u00a0for recipes involving\u00a0an abundance of lemon. The recipe\u00a0I was most drawn to, the aforementioned\u00a0Creamy Lemon Pasta,\u00a0only called for two lemons, which I don&#8217;t consider an abundance, but I chose it anyway, and I&#8217;m not sorry. (I am a little bit sorry, though, just a little bit,\u00a0to say that\u00a0June has been on a real nudity bender, and while I cannot blame her &#8211; being naked is great, and we should probably all be naked, all the time\u00a0&#8211; it\u00a0<em>does<\/em> make\u00a0photographing our family dinner a special\u00a0challenge.)<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9644 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/F7A6713-662x441.jpg\" alt=\"_F7A6713\" width=\"662\" height=\"441\" srcset=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/F7A6713-662x441.jpg 662w, http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/F7A6713-768x512.jpg 768w, http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/F7A6713-870x580.jpg 870w, http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/F7A6713.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This pasta was first published in the\u00a0<em>New York Times<\/em>\u00a0in 1999, and at this point, it would be fair to call it timeless. It is, to me, the definition of good everyday food\u00a0&#8211; or, as Kafka put it, &#8220;luxurious weeknight cooking at its best.&#8221; Oooh la.\u00a0\u00a0You probably already have everything you need for it. Cook some noodles, egg or otherwise, until tender. In the time that takes, you warm a cup of cream in a saucepan with strips of zest from two lemons, salt, and black pepper. When the pasta is cooked\u00a0and the cream has just hit the boil, you pour the latter over the former, add a generous splash of\u00a0lemon juice,\u00a0mix it all up, and cook it for a few minutes more, so that the sauce reduces to coat the noodles. Kafka has you serve it with additional black pepper, but I strongly, strongly suggest you go one step further and grate some Parmesan over each portion.<\/p>\n<p>Ahhhh.
