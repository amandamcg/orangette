Maggie was infinitely cooler than I was, and slightly terrifying, and I probably would have tried to like any music she played, but I didn&#8217;t need any reason to love\u00a0<em>OK Computer<\/em>. It blew my head off. It was sexy and weirdly, wonderfully wrenching. I decided immediately that I wanted to lose my virginity while listening to the song &#8220;Let Down,&#8221; because it was so\u00a0<em>poignant<\/em>, dawwwwww, and so\u00a0<em>pretty. <\/em>It was only much later that I realized that\u00a0losing one&#8217;s virginity to a song called &#8220;Let Down&#8221; would be (tragi-)comedic gold. Possibly the best joke of my life, and I didn&#8217;t even notice.
