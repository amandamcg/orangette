So, no, I don\u2019t have much to show for my time on the road. Nothing except a few spent Sharpies, some dirty clothes, and a lot of disbelief and wonder that it ever happened at all.<\/p>\n<p>Somehow, when I thought about doing a book tour, I imagined myself standing painfully, night after night, in front of a roomful of empty chairs, listening to the hum of the ceiling lights and cracking halfhearted jokes with the guy at the cash register to keep from curling into the fetal position and dying on the spot. But miraculously, that was not the case, not even once, and I have you to thank for that. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Thank you<\/span>. This blog has always felt to me like a conversation, a conversation that we\u2019ve had for going on five years, but until now, I never got to see your faces, and you never got to see mine. In the past couple of weeks, that has started to change, and I like the feeling of it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0eb40-polaphillytrainstation1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5316453112936873858\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0eb40-polaphillytrainstation1.jpg?w=248\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nSo thank you, and thank you again. Thank you to the bookstores who hosted me, to the friends and family who gave me beds and blankets and bought me cheeseburgers, to those of you who e-mailed and left comments here, and to those of you who came out to say hello, bearing brownies, biscotti, cookies, rugelach, olives, jam, dish towels, maple syrup, fancy salt, and handwritten recipes.

The guy who runs the place is terrific. He\u2019s very quiet and intentional, and very happy in a quiet, intentional way. He never rushes or seems harried, and half of the time, rather than charging you to fix your machine, he tells you how to fix it yourself, for free. He has a dry-erase board in the shop where he writes observations or snatches of wisdom, things seemingly simple &#8211; dead-simple, really, and even somewhat hokey &#8211; that you somehow wind up thinking about for days, turning over and over like a coin in your pocket. My friend Ben has taken to referring to the espresso repair guy as his Guru on the Hill, which nicely sums up how we feel about him.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, this weekend, Ben called to tell me that he had gone to the shop last week, and when he walked in, the guru was writing on the dry-erase board, and what it said was, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what happens next.\u201d I don\u2019t know about you, but I think there is something sort of great about that. And I second it, in about eight million different ways.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/454e5-poladcmetro1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5316453092105177714\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/454e5-poladcmetro1.jpg?w=247\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nI am going to keep this short, since I\u2019m more tired than I would like to admit.
