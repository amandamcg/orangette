No, no, I know! <em>Your breakfast<\/em>!\u201d he shouts, ever the wise guy, over the <em>ping! ping! ping<\/em>! of my spoon against the bowl.) Yes, as I was saying, I am good at many, many things, but <strong>I am a true champion at lists<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>I love lists. They\u2019re so liberating. I can purge my entire brain onto a piece of paper, and Look! There it is! I don\u2019t have to think about things anymore, because the paper does it for me. I can see exactly what needs to be done, and then I can decide what to do\u2014or, even better\u2014what <em>not<\/em> to do. [Oh, sweet liberty!] Most days come with a list, and some weekends do too. Under my roof, even the grocery list has a little space of its own, albeit a small, fat-splattered one on the shelf next to the stove, beside a looming pile of cookbooks. But my favorite variation on the theme, my pet list, is a messy Post-It that sticks in my agenda. It is the nerve center, the motherboard, the county seat. It is my list of <strong>what to cook<\/strong>. Because some days, you know, you forget. And if there\u2019s one thing better than a delicious meal, it\u2019s got to be <strong>a delicious meal that lets you check something off the list<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Tomato_tart_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/08\/Tomato_tart_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This tart is both. It\u2019s been on the Post-It\u2014one item of, oh, eleven\u2014for at least a month now, waiting for a few pounds of good Roma tomatoes to make it possible. I tore the recipe from a magazine a few summers ago on a trip home to see my mother, who always plants a fat, shiny pile of recent food magazines and other ragtag mail\u2014the newsletter from my grade school, say, or the society pages from <a href=\"http:\/\/okcfriday.com\/\"><em>Oklahoma City Friday<\/em><\/a>, \u201cThe Newspaper for Oklahoma\u2019s Trendsetters!\u201d\u2014on my bed as a welcome-home present. (My mom knows <em>just<\/em> what I like.) To make a long story short, said recipe joined me for the trip back to Seattle and has, in the summers since, taken up <strong>permanent residence in my seasonal repertoire<\/strong>. It\u2019s an old friend of sorts, one I\u2019ve been wanting to introduce you to. Hence, you see, its presence on the list.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Tomato_tart_cut_text.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/08\/Tomato_tart_cut_text.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>And if you know a good thing when you see it, you\u2019ll add it to your list too. Bright with the summery, sweetly acidic flavor of tomatoes, this tart tastes like the color red incarnate, a lush, vibrant, saturated flavor. I like to think of it as <strong>a cousin to pizza, one with a frilly collar and a French accent<\/strong>. Under its layers of thyme-and-oil-roasted tomatoes lies a thin cushion of cheese and a basecoat of mustard mixed with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, whose soft dairy tang brings a creamy quality to the sweet-tart tomatoes. Gathered together in a tart shell made with plenty of butter, this thing calls for some serious plate-scraping, if not \u201cWorld Champion\u201d status.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><strong>Roasted Tomato Tart with Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche and Thyme<\/strong><br \/>Inspired by <em>Food &amp; Wine<\/em>, June 2003<\/p>\n<p>This tart is a tad labor-intensive, but if you\u2019ve got time to spare on a Sunday afternoon, it\u2019s well worth the effort. And as an added benefit\u2014a gift with purchase, if you will\u2014you\u2019ll get a wonderfully fragrant kitchen too. As Brandon said, pointing to the oven, \u201cThat smells <em>amazing<\/em>.\u201d In a pinch, you can try leaving the skins on the tomatoes: the texture of the finished tart filling won\u2019t be as uniform and silky, but it\u2019ll still taste good, and it\u2019ll take less time. Also, depending on what\u2019s in your garden or at your local farmers\u2019 market, you can try using other types of thyme. We used lemon thyme, because that\u2019s what we had.<\/p>\n<p>4 lbs ripe plum tomatoes, trimmed, halved, and seeded<br \/>\u00bc cup olive oil<br \/>1 Tbs fresh thyme leaves<br \/>Kosher salt<br \/>2 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced<br \/>\u00bd batch <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marthastewart.com\/portal\/site\/mslo\/menuitem.fc77a0dbc44dd1611e3bf410b5900aa0\/?vgnextoid=7ab340ee0c90f010VgnVCM1000003d370a0aRCRD&amp;autonomy_kw=pate%20brisee&amp;rsc=ns2006_m4\">Martha Stewart\u2019s p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e<\/a> without sugar (enough for one 9-inch tart), unbaked, or your favorite savory pastry recipe<br \/>2 Tbs cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche<br \/>1 Tbs whole grain mustard<br \/>\u00bd cup finely shredded gruy\u00e8re cheese<\/p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and place racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven.<\/p>\n<p>In a large mixing bowl, toss the tomatoes with olive oil, thyme, and a generous pinch or two of salt. Arrange the tomatoes, cut side down, on a rimmed baking sheet, and pour over them any oil that is left in the bowl. Slide the tomatoes into the oven and bake for 35 minutes. Remove the tomatoes from the oven, and let them sit for about 5 minutes. Working carefully, remove the tomato skins. [I find that a pair of rubber gloves\u2014the yellow, snug-fitting kind that you might wear when you wash dishes\u2014helps here, but if your fingers are less heat-sensitive than mine, you might be just fine without them.] Turn the tomatoes cut side up, nestle the slices of garlic into their flesh, and roast for 30-35 minutes more, until the tomatoes look a little dry and the garlic is pale golden. Let the tomatoes cool.<\/p>\n<p>While the tomatoes cook, roll out the p\u00e2te bris\u00e9e on a lightly floured surface. Press it gently into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom, and fold in the overhang to reinforce the sides. Trim away any excess dough. Chill the tart shell until the tomatoes are finished roasting.<\/p>\n<p>When the tomatoes are ready, line the tart shell with aluminum foil and fill with pie weights. Bake the tart shell for 30-35 minutes, or until just set. Remove the foil and the weights, and bake the tart shell for 5 minutes longer, or until pale golden.<\/p>\n<p>In a small bowl, mix the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and the mustard; then spread the mixture evenly over the bottom of the tart shell. Sprinkle the cheese on top. Arrange the tomatoes in the tart shell in two layers, cut side up. Bake the tart for 25 minutes, or until the tomatoes are just beginning to brown at their edges. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Tomato_tart_slice_text.4.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2006\/08\/Tomato_tart_slice_text.4.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Yield: 6 servings, for an appetizer or a light lunch<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am a list-maker.
