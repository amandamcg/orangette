This soup does not have the aura of a champion. It looks like a heap of cubed vegetables &#8211; or, shall we say, <i>roughly<\/i> cubed; you will never see me teach a knife skills class &#8211; in broth. Stay with me.<\/p>\n<p>I was introduced to this soup by my friend <a href=\"http:\/\/dressingfordinner.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Gemma<\/a>, who made it for dinner one night in Edinburgh. We\u2019d been out of the house all day, <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2011\/11\/october-29.html\" target=\"_blank\">walking<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2011\/11\/october-31.html\" target=\"_blank\">around town<\/a>. In the late afternoon, we ducked into <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mellischeese.co.uk\/MellisHome.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Mellis<\/a> for cheeses and oatcakes, and then into a pub, and by the time we got home, it was probably seven. That\u2019s the point when I would usually say, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Screw it, we\u2019re having scrambled eggs<\/span>, but Gemma turned on the stove, and an hour later, we sat down to this soup.<\/p>\n<p>The recipe, she told me, comes from a book called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Great-British-Food-Cass-Titcombe\/dp\/0091936322?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321985507&amp;sr=8-1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\">Great British Food<\/a><\/span>, by the team behind London\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.canteen.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">Canteen<\/a>. If I can be perfectly honest, I\u2019m glad I tasted the soup before I saw the recipe, because on paper, it looks like it might not add up to much. It looks plain. Possibly too plain to taste like anything. I ought to know, because in my household, I am notorious for choosing soup recipes like this: elegantly simple ones that promise the moon, but more often than not, wind up tasting like warm, lightly salted tap water. It\u2019s my specialty. (I do not write about such recipes here, for obvious reasons, but Brandon can tell you <i>all<\/i> about them.)<\/p>\n<p>This soup is not like that. Yes, it is simple. It\u2019s mostly vegetables and broth. But what makes it special, I think, is the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">combination<\/span> of vegetables: not just the usual mix of onion, carrot, and celery, but also parsnip (or rutabaga), Savoy cabbage (or Brussels sprouts), a leek, and some fresh thyme &#8211; in other words, lots of sweetness, fragrance, and depth. Plus a fistful of pearl barley, which gives it a hearty chew. The flavors are clear and clean, but also immensely satisfying. Brandon ate <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">two bowls of it<\/span>. MY STREAK IS BROKEN.<\/p>\n<p>I should also note that, because this recipe uses small amounts of a number of vegetables, it\u2019s a handy way to clear out the crisper drawer after a period of insanity, also known as Thanksgiving. And if you plan to make turkey stock on Friday from the bones and last bits, I\u2019ll bet this would be a good way to use it. In any case, I think you\u2019re going to like it. It\u2019s instant Repertoire Material.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Thanksgiving.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Vegetable and Pearl Barley Soup<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Great-British-Food-Cass-Titcombe\/dp\/0091936322?ie=UTF8&qid=1321985507&sr=8-1&_encoding=UTF8&tag=orangette-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\">Great British Food<\/a><\/span>, by Cass Titcombe, Patrick Clayton-Malone, and Dominic Lake<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2011-11-23T23:01:00-05:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/461?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>A few notes:\u00a0I used homemade chicken stock to make this soup, but you could also use good-tasting store-bought chicken or vegetable stock.
