(Hey: another time when I mentioned this fridge-top collection, one of you asked if I would consider writing a post about the books I keep there. Does that still interest you? <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">I\u2019d forgotten about that request until now, but really, I\u2019d be very happy to do it<\/span>. <i>Update<\/i>: I am an idiot. I forgot about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seriouseats.com\/2014\/07\/molly-wizenberg-orangette-delancey-favorite-cookbooks-interview.html\" target=\"_blank\">this post on Serious Eats<\/a>! That said, the top of the fridge looks quite different today, with new books coming out, and I would be happy to tell you about it.) I turned the book over and flipped to the index, looked up the page number (169) for the recipe, and proceeded to thumb backward toward it, but I overshot the mark and found myself on page 163 instead, looking at a recipe for Honey-Roasted Carrots with Tahini Yogurt.<\/p>\n<p>I paused long enough to skim through the ingredients. I had everything, as it happened, including a fresh bag of carrots and a newly opened container of tahini left over from another recipe and now waiting to be finished. I am famous within the four walls of my house for buying tahini, using approximately two tablespoons, and then entombing the remainder at the back of the fridge for a couple of years. Here was an opportunity to do something different. The mung beans could wait. (They\u2019re still waiting, and waiting, and waaaaaaaaiting&#8230;)<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0788c-_f7a57001.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0788c-_f7a57001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>You do not need me to tell you how smart, how good, and how necessary Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s <i>Plenty More <\/i>is. <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Plenty-Vibrant-Vegetable-Recipes-Ottolenghi\/dp\/1452101248\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Plenty<\/a><\/i> was seminal, and I think <i>Plenty More<\/i> is even more important. This particular recipe reminds me a lot of <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Casa-Moro-Sam-Clark\/dp\/0091938538\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=casa%20moro&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1433265766&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Casa Moro<\/a><\/i>\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/2007\/10\/sneaky-sneaky\/\" target=\"_blank\">Warm Butternut and Chickpea Salad with Tahini<\/a>, but maybe better. Ottolenghi uses carrots instead of squash and, instead of allspice, freshly toasted coriander and cumin seeds. His spicing feels more special as a result, more fragrant and beguiling, and the carrots get sticky-slick with honey, and the yogurt in the tahini sauce gives it both lightness and heft. To be totally honest, Ottolenghi did call for a little too much coriander for me &#8211; coriander seed, like marjoram, can start to taste the way potpourri smells &#8211; so I scaled it back when I typed up the recipe below, and I think it\u2019s just right. Next time, I might add chickpeas and red onion, \u00e0 la <i>Casa Moro<\/i>, and make a great thing greater.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/dc502-_f7a57131.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/dc502-_f7a57131.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>In any case, I made it for lunch on a day when I had the house all to myself &#8211; and had celebrated having the house all to myself by eating a gigantic slice of cinnamon-custard twist from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.larsensbakery.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Larsen&#8217;s<\/a> for breakfast &#8211; and it was exactly what I wanted. It\u2019s more than the sum of its parts, by far: one of those things that you can zap together without a trip to the grocery store and, afterward, makes you feel like putting on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CSav51fVlKU\" target=\"_blank\">the <i>Chariots of Fire<\/i> theme<\/a> and taking a victory lap around the table. That night, Brandon and I ate the leftover carrots and sauce with hot Italian sausages and a cucumber salad, and he liked the tahini-yogurt sauce so much that, after we\u2019d eaten all the carrots, he went to the cupboard, took down a box of Triscuits, and used the crackers to scoop up the last of the sauce from his plate and then the jar I\u2019d made it in.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Honey-and-Spice Roasted Carrots with Tahini Yogurt<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1607746212\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1607746212&linkCode=as2&tag=orangette-20&linkId=5M4TZJIDAP7QGKKQ\" target=\"_blank\">Plenty More<\/a><\/i><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2015-06-02T17:30:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/11?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>This recipe halves easily, and I\u2019ll bet it also doubles well.
