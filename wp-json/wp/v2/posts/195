Anyway, I think my mother will love this recipe, and if I hold off on posting until I have a proper photo, it\u2019ll be almost like I\u2019m depriving my mother, my very own mother, of happiness.<\/p>\n<p>I am not the first person in the world to own <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Smitten-Kitchen-Cookbook-Perelman\/dp\/030759565X\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook<\/a><\/i>, by the brilliant <a href=\"http:\/\/smittenkitchen.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Deb Perelman<\/a>, and I am also not the first person to be tempted by her recipe for Sesame-Spiced Turkey Meatballs. \u00a0Deb mentions in the sidebar that the recipe can be made with ground lamb instead of turkey, and what I am, in fact, is here to report that, yes, absolutely, it can! \u00a0I\u2019ve done it myself five or six times now. There is probably no meat that doesn\u2019t go well with toasted sesame seeds, garlic, cumin, coriander, and chile, but in most such cases, lamb would be my intuitive choice. The meatball that we\u2019re talking about here has the basic flavor profile of falafel, right, and since lamb shows up in cooking across the Middle East, falafel to lamb is a short leap. \u00a0I don\u2019t know, but I sort of want to call these Falafel-Spiced Lamb Meatballs. \u00a0Deb, I\u2019m screwing up everything.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, it\u2019s nothing more complicated than mixing up ground meat and seasonings in a bowl and rolling them into balls. It\u2019s the kind of cooking that can be accomplished with only minimal attention, while the rest of your brain is lulled to sleep by the sound of the waves crashing on the white noise machine in your kid\u2019s room on the other side of the wall. \u00a0(Or, you could listen to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Spilled Milk<\/a>.\u00a0Did you know that we\u2019re going weekly? And that you can <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spilledmilkpodcast.com\/donate\/\" target=\"_blank\">donate to the show<\/a>, which helps us buy ingredients and pay for hosting\u00a0and wins our devotion to the grave and beyond?) The resulting meatballs are juicy, fragrant with cumin and coriander and garlic, and when you chew, there\u2019s a faint, wonderful crackle of toasted sesame seeds between your teeth. The crackle might be the best part.<\/p>\n<p>Deb serves hers with a smashed-chickpea salad that\u2019s bright with sumac and lemon, and the combination is delicious. I like them with anything, though most often a pile of roasted vegetables. They would be perfect with couscous, or stuffed in a pita with shredded cabbage and chopped cucumber and some yogurt or tahini sauce, or even just heaped on plain rice with a cucumber salad on the side. \u00a0The main thing to know is,\u00a0<i>they would be perfect<\/i>.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Falafel-Spiced Lamb Meatballs<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted slightly from <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/The-Smitten-Kitchen-Cookbook-Perelman\/dp\/030759565X\/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=ur2&tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook<\/a><\/i>, by Deb Perelman<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2014-03-10T20:44:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/195?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>Deb\u2019s recipe calls for browning these meatballs in a pan and then finishing them in the oven, and while that certainly yields a stunner of a meatball, both in flavor and beauty, I regularly take a lazier route: I only bake them.

If you plan to skip the stovetop browning and only bake these, line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment.<\/p>\n<p>Put the sesame seeds in a small skillet, and place the skillet over medium heat. \u00a0Cook, stirring occasionally, until the seeds smell toasty and are beginning to turn golden. \u00a0I never pay attention to exactly how long this takes, but it\u2019s not terribly long.<\/p>\n<p>While the sesame seeds toast, put the lamb through cayenne in a medium bowl. \u00a0When they\u2019re ready, add the toasted sesame seeds. \u00a0Mix with a fork (or with your hand, my preference) until evenly mixed. Form the meat mixture into 1\u00bd-inch, or golf-ball-sized, balls. \u00a0(This is easiest to do if your hands are wet; that will help to keep the meat from sticking to you.) If you plan to brown the meatballs on the stovetop, arrange them on a tray or large plate; if you plan to only bake them, arrange them on the prepared sheet pan.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, if you\u2019re lazy like me, put the sheet pan in the oven and walk away. After about 10 minutes, pull out your thermometer (all hail the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Splash-Proof-Super-Fast-Thermapen-Thermometer-Professional\/dp\/B002GIZZWM\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=thermapen&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1394253810&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Thermapen<\/a>! Possibly my single favorite kitchen tool!) and poke one or two of the meatballs: when they\u2019re ready, the internal temperature will be between 160 and 165 degrees. \u00a0If they\u2019re not hot enough, slide them back in, and check again shortly. Again, I never seem to keep track of how long they take to cook. Somewhere between 12 and 15 minutes, I think?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a better person and plan to brown your meatballs as Deb directs, heat a generous slick of oil in a large ovenproof skillet or saut\u00e9 pan. Brown the meatballs in batches, taking care not to crowd the pan or nudge them before they\u2019re good and brown. Be gentle as you turn them: they\u2019re soft! Transfer the meatballs to a paper-towel-lined tray or plate, and continue cooking in more batches until they\u2019re all browned. Then discard the oil, wipe all but a little of it from the pan, and return all of the meatballs to the pan. Slide into the oven, and bake until a thermometer reads an internal temperature of 160 to 165 degrees, or about 10 to 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p><i>Note<\/i>: These meatballs freeze beautifully. \u00a0I like to cook about half of them right away and then freeze the remaining half on a sheet pan lined with parchment. \u00a0When they\u2019re frozen solid, I transfer them from the pan to a plastic storage bag. They thaw quickly &#8211; and actually, I\u2019ve even baked them while they were still slightly frozen. It took a bit longer, but no harm done.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: about 4 servings, or roughly 25 meatballs<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our friend Ben is in town for a visit, and this past Friday, while we waited in line for lunch at Il Corvo\u00a0&#8211; always worth the wait, in case you ever walked by and wondered &#8211; I told him about some lamb meatballs that I wanted to write up, but that I had a problem: the only photo I have is of the raw meat and seasonings in a bowl.
