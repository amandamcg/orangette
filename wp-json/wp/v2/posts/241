This soup is for a day like that, a cold day when soup is what a person wants to eat, a nice ordinary day. June and I shared a bowl of it one Sunday night, and I ate another bowl while I did payroll on Monday afternoon, and it was so good, so right for right now, that I considered hoarding the rest of the batch. But because no expense is too great for the opportunity to watch June &#8220;dance,&#8221; I let her have it.<\/p>\n<p>The recipe for this soup comes from <a href=\"http:\/\/topics.nytimes.com\/top\/reference\/timestopics\/people\/c\/melissa_clark\/\" target=\"_blank\">Melissa Clark<\/a> and her wonderful book\u00a0<i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Cook-This-Now-Delectable-Dishes\/dp\/1401323987\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Cook This Now<\/a><\/i>. I was flipping through it recently, and I don\u2019t know what it is, but every recipe she writes sounds fantastic. She\u2019s&#8230; bewitching. That\u2019s the word for it. \u00a0I read one of her recipe titles, any one of her recipe titles, and I come to a few minutes later, standing in front of the refrigerator. Buckwheat Pancakes with Sliced Peaches and Cardamom Cream Syrup! I don\u2019t like\u00a0anything but maple syrup on my pancakes &#8211; the truth, revealed &#8211; but because of Melissa, I will make that damned cardamom cream syrup. And Seared Wild Salmon with Brown Butter Cucumbers! \u00a0 Fragrant Lentil Rice Soup with Spinach and Crispy Onions! \u00a0Ham Bone, Greens, and Bean Soup!!!!!! \u00a0My tea this morning might have been stronger than I thought.<\/p>\n<p>This soup is one of those full-meal-in-one-bowl numbers, thick with beans, carrots, celery, onion, cabbage, and kale, with big flavor from the ham bone and some bacon fat. \u00a0(You start the recipe by cooking chopped bacon, which you then scoop out and reserve for a garnish while you cook the vegetables in the fat. \u00a0As you can imagine, the bacon fat contributes a nice, meaty richness. But if you\u2019d rather skip the bacon step for some reason, I\u2019ll bet you could use olive oil or butter. I should also mention that I forgot to use the bacon garnish and didn\u2019t miss it, possibly because the bacon fat and ham bone were so flavorful.) \u00a0The beans wind up tender and creamy, and the broth is sweet and smoky and deeply hammy, but the best part might be the cabbage, which softens until it nearly melts. \u00a0I ate mine with a dash of hot sauce, because pork likes a little vinegary heat. If you find yourself with a ham bone, you know what to do.<\/p>\n<p>P.S.

So if you have a ham bone, use it! You will be rewarded. If not, a ham hock will also be good. My ham bone fit easily into the pot I used, but Melissa Clark suggests that, in general, you ask your butcher to cut it in half or thirds for you, so that it\u2019s guaranteed to fit and also has some marrow exposed.<\/p>\n<p>As for beans, you could probably use any light-colored bean you like. I had a bag of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ranchogordo.com\/mm5\/merchant.mvc?Screen=SFNT&amp;Store_Code=RG\" target=\"_blank\">Rancho Gordo<\/a>\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ranchogordo.com\/mm5\/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=RG&amp;Product_Code=1YEL&amp;Category_Code=DHAHB4#.Uo-SlpSxOac\" target=\"_blank\">yellow eye beans<\/a> in the cupboard, so I used those. (Rancho Gordo beans make a great holiday present, by the way.) \u00a0Also, I find that adding a little salt when I soak dried beans makes them turn out better when I cook them, and here\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.americastestkitchenfeed.com\/super-quick-video-tips\/2012\/04\/the-importance-of-brining-your-beans-video\/\" target=\"_blank\">a video<\/a>\u00a0from America\u2019s Test Kitchen that explains why. \u00a0I don\u2019t tend to use the full amount of salt that\u2019s called for in the video, but I have, and it worked beautifully. \u00a0(I don\u2019t use that much because I tend to forget to rinse the beans after soaking, and then I wind up with salty beans. Using less salt still seems to help, and then there\u2019s no need to rinse.)<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 cup (175 grams) dried pinto beans, or another bean you like\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            4 strips bacon, cut into \u00bd-inch pieces\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 large carrots, diced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 celery stalks, diced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 large yellow onion, diced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 garlic cloves, finely chopped\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 ham bone (about 1 \u00bc lb. \/ 565 grams)\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 bay leaf\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd head (about \u00be lb. \/ 340 grams) green cabbage, cored and thinly sliced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 bunch kale (about \u00bd lb. \/ 225 grams), stems removed and leaves chopped into bite-size pieces\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Freshly ground black pepper, for serving\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Hot sauce, for serving          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Twelve to 24 hours before you plan to start the soup, put the beans in a bowl and cover with plenty of cold water. Add a generous pinch of salt. Set aside at room temperature. (Or, if you don\u2019t have that much time, you can instead use a quick-soak method: put the beans, lots of cold water, and a generous pinch of salt in a pot, bring it to a boil, turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let stand for 1 hour. Drain, and then proceed with the recipe.)<\/p>\n<p>Warm a large (about 5-quart) pot over medium-high heat. Add the bacon, and cook until crisp, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate, and save for garnishing the soup. Add the carrots, celery, and onion to the bacon fat in the pan. Cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook for 1 minute more.<\/p>\n<p>Put the ham bone and bay leaf into the pot, and add 8 cups water and 2 teaspoons kosher salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat; then add the beans, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Stir in the cabbage and simmer for 30 minutes more. At this point, fish out a bean and taste it: it should be nearly done. If it\u2019s still pretty firm, let the soup simmer a bit longer before continuing. Then stir in the kale and simmer until the kale is soft but still bright green, about 15 minutes. Remove the ham bone and bay leaf. If you\u2019d like, you can pull the meat from the ham bone, chop it up, and stir it back into the soup.<\/p>\n<p>Serve with freshly ground black pepper and a dash of hot sauce, and more salt, if needed. (Oh, and crumbled bacon, if you want.)<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 6 to 8 servings<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So, how bored will you be if we talk about soup again?
