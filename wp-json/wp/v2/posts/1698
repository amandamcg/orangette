For nearly twenty years, December was no ordinary month on my mother\u2019s calendar: it was a series of nut-filled, chocolate-covered, butter-rich weeks, of afternoons spent churning out cookies, candies, chocolates, bars, and toffees by the dozen. When it began, I had a pacifier; when it ended, I had half a college diploma; and along the way, I had a sequence of fickle love affairs with nearly every confection my mother made. <strong>Some measure maturity in birthdays, milestones, firsts, or lasts, but I plot my personal chronology in Christmas cookies.<br \/><\/strong><br \/>As is often the case, mine was a humble beginning. My mother\u2019s Christmas cookie tin was a gorgeous, glamorous thing, but in the early days, I only had eyes for <strong>a modest, brown, burnt-sugar candy called Aunt Bill\u2019s<\/strong>. Endemic to the South and a few lucky Plains states, it is creamy, chewy stuff, the flavor of praline melded with the texture of fudge, made from butter, sugar, cream, pecans, and inordinate amounts of muscular stirring. Tooth-achingly good, Aunt Bill\u2019s candy was just the thing for a pre-adolescent sweet tooth\u2014until, of course, I tasted chocolate \u201crads,\u201d the dark, crackly, bittersweet chocolate-on-chocolate cookies that would usher me into puberty. But before another holiday season had passed, I had already begun a slow turn toward <strong>the Linzer cookie, classic and classy in its fancy powdered sugar coat<\/strong>, with a nutty almond base and rosy raspberry filling. Then, at age eighteen, I thought I had at long last found the final frontier in a now-crunchy, now-melty mouthful of <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/12\/with-my-own-two-hands.html\">coffee-walnut toffee<\/a>. But I was mistaken. I had not yet tasted <strong>a chocolate-dipped fruit-nut ball<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Fruit_Nut_Balls_twins.0.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/12\/Fruit_Nut_Balls_twins.0.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>My mother had been making them since the late 1980s, when the recipe was published in <em>Gourmet<\/em>, but for reasons of irrational childhood prejudice and suspicion of <strong>not-too-sweet sweets<\/strong>, the fruit-nut ball had never crossed my lips. In the end, that fateful first bite only took place because I was stuck in an airport somewhere between Oklahoma and California, in transit back to college after Christmas and cursed with a long layover. I was hungry, and by chance, I had a tin of my mother\u2019s cookies stashed in my bag. They were intended for my freshman advisor, a lovely South Indian woman who had invited me \u201chome\u201d for countless dals and curries and was long overdue for proper thanks\u2014but, I told myself, with a little rearranging of the tin\u2019s contents, she\u2019d never know that something was missing. I studied the tin, reasoning that the fruit-nut ball\u2014though untested and, frankly, unpromising\u2014might be my best bet: it seemed at least remotely healthy, and since it was <em>obviously<\/em> the dud of the bunch, I wouldn\u2019t be depriving my friend of anything particularly good. So I plucked one from the tin, careful not to disturb its neighbors, and I took a bite.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Fruit_Nut_Balls_close.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/12\/Fruit_Nut_Balls_close.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>The chocolate cap gave way to a rush of powdered sugar, and beneath it, <strong>a soft, dark, winy chew<\/strong>. The dried fruits and walnuts, finely chopped and held together only by a splash of juice, had morphed together into a third something, <strong>a flavor at once floral and musky, almost alcoholic<\/strong>, simple on the page but complex on the tongue. It was sophisticated, adults-only stuff from the first bite to the fourth ball, which I handily tucked away shortly before boarding. Needless to say, the tin never found its way out of my dorm room, and eight years later, I still find myself stuck on the chocolate-dipped fruit-nut ball\u2014not a cookie in the strict sense, perhaps, but certainly a coming-of-age.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chocolate-Dipped Fruit-Nut Balls<\/strong><br \/>Inspired by <em>Gourmet<\/em>, March 1986<\/p>\n<p>My mother and I find that these little confections improve with time, so for maximum enjoyment, plan to stash them in the fridge for a few days before eating. I like them best cold from the fridge, but then again, I also like cold <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/02\/man-who-knows-meatballs.html\">meatballs<\/a> and cold <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/10\/semantics-of-stewing.html\">stewed prunes<\/a>. I also like doing my Christmas cooking and baking to the tune of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00000255F\/qid=1134270650\/sr=8-6\/ref=pd_bbs_6\/002-7503642-7804805?n=507846&amp;s=music&amp;v=glance\">Thunder Road<\/a>\u201d played over and over, very loud and passionately lip-synced.

Remove the walnuts to a large mixing bowl.<\/p>\n<p>Rinse the bowl of food processor, wipe it dry, and fill it with the dried fruit. Pulse the machine to chop the fruit finely. You don\u2019t want to turn the fruit into a gummy pur\u00e9e, but you do want it to be chopped finely enough that there are no pieces larger than a pea. Remove the fruit to the bowl with the walnuts, and stir them to mix. Add 1 Tbs fruit juice or liqueur, and stir to combine. Pinch off a smallish wad of the fruit-nut mixture: when you roll it between your palms, does it hold together in a tight ball? If not, add a bit more juice or liqueur until it does.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Fruit_Nut_Balls_plain.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/12\/Fruit_Nut_Balls_plain.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Pour about \u00bd cup of powdered sugar into a small bowl; you can add more later, if needed. Pinching off little mounds of the fruit-nut mixture, shape them into 1-inch balls, roll each ball lightly in powdered sugar to coat, and place them on a baking sheet. Let the balls stand at room temperature, uncovered, for 24 hours.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Fruit_Nut_Balls_dipped.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2005\/12\/Fruit_Nut_Balls_dipped.jpg\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, and keep it close at hand. In the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, melt the chocolate, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Remove it from the heat. Using a teaspoon, plop and dab and shake chocolate onto half of each ball; you may want to do this over the sink, wasteful though it may be, rather than over the bowl of chocolate\u2014otherwise your melted chocolate may be contaminated by sprinkles of powdered sugar. Place the balls on the lined baking sheet, and place them in the refrigerator until the chocolate has hardened. Tuck each ball into a small candy or cupcake cup, and store them in an airtight container, chilled, for up to 2 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Yield: About 50 balls.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/photos1.blogger.com\/blogger\/5046\/497\/1600\/Fruit_Nut_Balls_dipped.jpg\"><br \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It may have notoriously waving wheat and pastures full of prime Angus steak, but truth be told, Oklahoma\u2019s food scene is most famous\u2014in certain very exclusive, you understand, very select circles\u2014for my mother\u2019s holiday baking.
