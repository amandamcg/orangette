Right. A number of years ago, through this site, I got to know someone named Lisa. \u00a0She began as a reader and occasional commenter, and because she\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/coffeeinthewoodshed.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">a very, very good writer<\/a>, her comments always stood out. Over time, I started to feel like I knew her, and I hope the feeling is mutual. \u00a0We\u2019ve never met in person, but we\u2019ve kept in touch in various ways, and she now has her own site, which is where, a couple of weeks ago, I found <a href=\"http:\/\/coffeeinthewoodshed.com\/2013\/10\/08\/id-like-to-sip-my-cider\/\" target=\"_blank\">this recipe<\/a> for a winter squash soup with curry and coconut milk. I\u2019m sure you already have a standby winter squash soup &#8211; I already had two &#8211; but this one grabbed me right away: not only does it involve squash, curry, and coconut milk, but it also calls for maple syrup, fish sauce, Sriracha, and lime.<\/p>\n<p>!<\/p>\n<p>I now have three standby winter squash soups.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the best part &#8211; at least in this particular stage of my life &#8211; is that I can prep it quickly, bang it all in a pot, cover it, and let it ride alone for half an hour while I recover from parenting Animal. And it only improves over subsequent meals, as soups do.<\/p>\n<p>Happy weekend.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Winter Squash Soup with Curry and Coconut Milk<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from Lisa Moussalli and <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bhg.com\/recipe\/soups\/butternut-squash-soup-with-thai-gremolata\/\" target=\"_blank\">Better Homes and Gardens<\/a><\/i><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2013-11-01T22:39:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/249?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>I\u2019ve made this soup twice now, once with kabocha squash and once with butternut. I slightly preferred the flavor of the kabocha, but I liked the texture of the butternut soup. (I also appreciate the fact that butternuts are easier to peel. I would rather throw a kabocha out the window than peel it.) You could use any winter squash, really &#8211; though if yours isn\u2019t especially sweet, you might want an additional tablespoon of sweetener. And for the record, you don\u2019t <i>have<\/i> to use maple syrup; you could try regular sugar, or brown sugar. In any case, taste and adjust as needed before serving.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and I\u2019ll bet this recipe would double nicely.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 medium or large yellow onion, chopped\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 or 4 large garlic cloves, minced\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tablespoon curry powder\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 winter squash (about 2 pounds \/ 500 g), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 (14-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 cups (475 ml) chicken or vegetable broth\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tablespoon maple syrup\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 teaspoon Sriracha or other Asian chile sauce\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Juicy wedges of lime, for serving          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Warm the oil in a Dutch oven (or other approximately 5-quart pot) over medium heat. Add the onions, and cook, stirring, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the curry powder, and cook for 1 minute more. Add the squash, coconut milk, broth, maple syrup, fish sauce, and Sriracha, and stir well. Raise the heat to bring to a boil; then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the squash is soft, about 30 to 40 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Using an immersion blender (or a regular blender), puree the soup until smooth and velvety. Taste for salt and sweetness, and adjust if necessary. (I don\u2019t find that this soup needs any additional salt \u2013 it gets a lot from the fish sauce \u2013 but you may disagree.) Ladle the soup into big bowls, add a generous squeeze of lime to each, and serve hot.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: about 4 servings<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Would you look at that!
