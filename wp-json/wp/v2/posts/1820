And please, don\u2019t be shy: ask for my brother David, introduce yourselves, and demand to be treated like kings. Were I there, I\u2019d roll out a red carpet for you to saunter down in your excellent pants. If all is not perfect, I will give that brother of mine the best sisterly talking-to I can muster. When he was a teenager and rode his motorcycle down our street without a helmet, I\u2014then only two or three years old\u2014tattled on him to Mom and Burg. And <em>[, she says threateningly,]<\/em> I can do it again.<\/p>\n<p>Now, dear Doron, I\u2019m going to hijack your happy occasion and use it to my own ends. This is a fantastic chance to share, gush over, and celebrate two things you\u2019ve taught me\u2014both food-related, of course.<\/p>\n<p>The first, in our 1999-2000 students-on-a-stipend days: <strong>l\u2019As du Fallafel<\/strong> (34, rue des Rosiers, 75004 Paris).<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" height=\"382\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2004\/09\/Falafel.11.jpg\" width=\"416\" \/><\/p>\n<p>How many times have I ordered these messy meals from hip-hoppy waiters with slicked black hair and yarmulkes? How much tahini-soaked cabbage have I dripped onto the table or licked from my fingers, <em>sauce piquante<\/em> burning a hole in my tongue? How many crispy, golden knobs of fallafel can one small girl eat without seeming reckless? Unfathomable questions, all. This summer Doron had the tremendously good fortune of finding an apartment only four doors down from this Israeli outpost, and the season\u2019s refrain was <em>\u201cUne fallafel sp\u00e9ciale, s\u2019il vous plait!\u201d<\/em> L\u2019As, I dream of you. Seattle&#8217;s Zaina works in a pinch, but it doesn&#8217;t come close.<\/p>\n<p>The second, in our June-July 2004 sorely-missing-a-stipend days: <strong>gin and tonic<\/strong>! [Actually, Doron and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xanga.com\/home.aspx?user=eeeelizabeth\">Elizabeth<\/a> were my co-teachers in this venture, so I celebrate you both. In fact, those who\u2019ve been reading closely may have noticed that I\u2019ve celebrated you often this summer.] Oh swelteringly hot Parisian summer evenings under the eaves, nothing tames you like a gin and tonic. Oh dirty laundry and cursed crowded streets and a million flights of skinny stairs and sweat dripping into the crease of my elbow, nothing refreshes like a gin and tonic. Liz says that gin tastes like paint thinner, and if that\u2019s true, I\u2019m lucky that my art supplies are in Oklahoma. Before summer recedes and we turn to more wintery beverages, please try this:<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/mailman.xmission.com\/pipermail\/exotica\/2004-May\/017619.html\">David Rosengarten&#8217;s Frosty Plymouth Gin and Tonic*<br \/><\/a><\/strong><br \/>This formula serves two if your name is Molly, or one if you are less of a lightweight and\/or do not find yourself sometimes restrained, as I do, by the <strong>vestiges of teenage <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Straight_edge\"><strong>straight-edge<\/strong><\/a><strong>dom<\/strong>.
