Thus concludes my discussion of the steak. Let&#8217;s talk romaine.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody talks about romaine. I too used to dismiss it, in as much as one might bother to formulate dismissive feelings toward a type of lettuce. But a few years ago, I changed my mind. Of the lettuces available at an ordinary grocery store, I now almost always choose it. It&#8217;s not fancy, but it is consistently good, with its mild but unmistakable flavor and that juicy, resilient, water-chestnut crunch. I am not bored by romaine. I usually slice it cross-wise from tip to stem for salads, but sometimes I halve it lengthwise and roast it instead &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/momfilter.com\/food\/my-new-way-with-romaine\" target=\"_blank\">thank you, Yolanda Edwards<\/a>! &#8211; and sometimes, especially in the case of a Caesar, I just whack off the stem end, dress the leaves, and serve them whole, and we eat them with our fingers.<\/p>\n<p>A couple of months ago, on a quick work trip to California, I was asked to make dressing for a Caesar salad, and I realized with a start that I didn\u2019t know how. It\u2019s not that I consider this a particularly glaring omission in the experience of being alive; there are a lot of things more important, starting with access to affordable housing and clean drinking water and the right to vote and believe me, I could go on, could I ever, but there I was in California, and it was dinnertime. I was at my cousin Katie\u2019s house. Her husband Andre was grilling burgers, and Katie was getting their son ready for bed. My assignment was Caesar salad. Katie is a confident, no-recipes-needed kind of cook, and by the way she mentioned it, I knew she could make a Caesar dressing without much thought. So I did the part that I knew how to do, prepping the greens and putting them in a bowl, while I waited for Katie to finish the job.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-8810 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/F7A6086-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"_F7A6086-2\" width=\"5580\" height=\"3720\" srcset=\"https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/F7A6086-2-1.jpg 5580w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/F7A6086-2-1-662x441.jpg 662w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/F7A6086-2-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/F7A6086-2-1-1324x883.jpg 1324w, https:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/F7A6086-2-1-870x580.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 5580px) 100vw, 5580px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As I expected, she had an easy way with Caesar dressing. She assembled it in a half-pint Mason jar, entirely by eye: the juice of a lemon, maybe a couple tablespoons of mayonnaise, maybe a teaspoon of Dijon mustard, maybe a quarter cup of olive oil, a little vinegar, and black pepper, shaken to mix. We tossed it that night with torn-up kale and some farro that she had cooked earlier and stashed in the fridge. (Katie is full of good ideas like that &#8211; fleshing out salads with a handful of toasty cooked grains in lieu of croutons, putting a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.saveur.com\/article\/blog\/the-seven-minute-egg\" target=\"_blank\">seven-minute egg<\/a> on top, etc.) But when I came home, I was faced with that regrettable cosmic phenomenon familiar to all cooks, the phenomenon that makes the same dish taste better when someone else makes it than it does when you make it yourself. I decided to forge my own way.<\/p>\n<p>I took down <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0393020436\/?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=GNNOJANU4SJ7TPUM\" target=\"_blank\">The Zuni Caf\u00e9 Cookbook<\/a><\/i>, my own personal <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_The_Neverending_Story_characters#The_Southern_Oracle\" target=\"_blank\">Southern Oracle<\/a> of cooking, and asked Judy Rodgers, RIP, to teach me. What follows is her recipe. It&#8217;s not much more complicated than Katie&#8217;s, except the chopping of garlic and anchovies, which I guess <i>is<\/i> a little complicated. Instead of mayonnaise, it uses egg, which is more traditional but just as easy. Judy Rodgers&#8217;s version is what we made for my mother that Monday night, and we all pawed at the salad bowl. But if you&#8217;re turned off by using a raw egg, or if you&#8217;d just rather use mayonnaise, I&#8217;m also including a second recipe, a tweak on Katie&#8217;s recipe, a version that Brandon and I have worked up over the past couple of weeks. I happen to like both, and much to my surprise, the mayonnaise-based version has even made a salad-eater out of June, an avowed lettuce-dismisser. We&#8217;ve been on a Caesar bender, and I see no reason to stop.<\/p>\n<p>P.S.

Spoon some dressing into the bowl of lettuce, slide on a pair of gloves, and use your hands to gently rub the dressing onto each leaf.
