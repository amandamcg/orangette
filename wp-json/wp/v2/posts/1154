I had never had an eight-hour layover before, and I can\u2019t say that I recommend them, but if you do happen to have one, you should make sure that you\u2019re in Amsterdam.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5835d-polaamsterdambike1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5835d-polaamsterdambike1.jpg?w=296\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243771620618499634\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>The airport is conveniently attached to a train station, so we crammed our bags into a luggage locker, bought tickets, and went into town.  We were only there for a few hours, but it was long enough to have a bowl of tomato soup with bread and butter, to wind our way through the narrow streets and between the canals, and to have a torrid love affair with about 1,000 bicycles.  I don\u2019t know what it was about the bikes in Amsterdam, but they stole my heart right out of my chest.   They have upright handlebars and curvy fenders and sometimes a basket in front.  They are old and battered and rusted in spots, as functional as can be, and in their utterly simple way, they are <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">gorgeous<\/span>.  They\u2019re like men\u2019s lace-up dress shoes, the kind my dad used to wear with a suit: timeless, well-worn, almost romantic somehow.<\/p>\n<p>I also liked the buildings.  Especially this blue one here.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d40a9-polaamsterdambuilding1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d40a9-polaamsterdambuilding1.jpg?w=297\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243771622352912514\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>And in the late afternoon, the sun on the canals was nice too.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/65080-polaamsterdamwater1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/65080-polaamsterdamwater1.jpg?w=298\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243771634182115170\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>But we had somewhere else to go.  Namely, Bordeaux.  (Not Paris!  I know, I know.  I like to mix things up a little.)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/b726b-polagirondins1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/b726b-polagirondins1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243771988978938098\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>This was my first time in Bordeaux, but having now spent six days there, I can say with some authority that it is a very lovely place.  Especially in early September, when the sun shines almost every day, and the light in the evening makes the limestone buildings look glowy and golden, and you can walk around in jeans and flats and short sleeves and never get too hot or cold.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ded25-836000061.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/ded25-836000061.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5244117007260290098\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>It is also very beautiful, no matter where you look.  Whenever we crossed the Pont de Pierre, the stone bridge, I liked to look up at the street lamps.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/6520e-polachateauvalandraud11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/6520e-polachateauvalandraud11.jpg?w=298\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243771985067209618\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>And out in the countryside, you should always stop to look out at the vineyards along the road, even if you\u2019re in a hurry.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/709ed-polachateauvalandraud21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/709ed-polachateauvalandraud21.jpg?w=298\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243771989512235730\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Some of them are a bit much, but if you make good wine, I guess you can get away with things.  Like erecting a giant wine bottle sculpture at the edge of the property.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/91ee1-polamedoc1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/91ee1-polamedoc1.jpg?w=297\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243772216181217442\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>And should it happen to rain, you can still have a good time.  The view from the car is not half bad.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/cc737-83600008-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/cc737-83600008-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5244143964312463554\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>Plus, merlot grapes look very pretty when they are wet and drippy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/fba97-polamerlotgrapes1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/fba97-polamerlotgrapes1.jpg?w=297\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243772220559959794\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>And so do sauvignon blanc grapes.  Even if you are rushing to leave for a dinner reservation and get a shoeful of mud while you try to snap a photograph of them.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/720ae-polagreengrapes1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/720ae-polagreengrapes1.jpg?w=297\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243771992494084002\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>When you come back to the city, you can wear a different pair of shoes.  Ideally something comfortable, for walking on paving stones and old cobblestones.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5ade5-polabordeauxstreet1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/5ade5-polabordeauxstreet1.jpg?w=298\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5243771636157003746\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>And when you get home, you can give those muddy shoes a good cleaning.  As soon as you recover from the jet lag, of course.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">P.S.
