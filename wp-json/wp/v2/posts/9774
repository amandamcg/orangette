I&#8217;ve done a lot of living &#8211; maybe too much?\u00a0&#8211; in those 14 years. But I can still hear his voice in my head, and I can still feel the hug he gave me in our driveway before I left to drive to Seattle for graduate school, in September of 2002. Burg would be 87 now, and I&#8217;m sort of glad I never had to see him diminished by old age &#8211; or, at least, not more than he was diminished in his last weeks, as cancer had its way with him. He would be glad\u00a0to know that Mom and I now live a block apart, within sight of Puget Sound, and that one night in August, when things felt hard and I needed comfort, I pulled out an old t-shirt of his that I&#8217;d kept all this time but never worn, a royal blue\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tripadvisor.ca\/Restaurant_Review-g51560-d400296-Reviews-Classen_Grill-Oklahoma_City_Oklahoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">Classen Grill<\/a>\u00a0t-shirt with the logo on the back and the words &#8220;peaches and cream&#8221; written in four languages on the front. It still smelled like him, and I put it on and slept in it, and I felt better. Wherever he is, I hope he&#8217;s doing it up right, as he was in this photo (he&#8217;s on the left, with family friend Ed Fretwell on the right), drinking something boozy out of a plastic coupe in a swimming pool, eating well, and grinning about it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9780 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/burganded-625x500.jpg\" alt=\"burganded\" width=\"625\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/burganded-625x500.jpg 625w, http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/burganded-768x615.jpg 768w, http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/burganded-1250x1000.jpg 1250w, http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/burganded-870x696.jpg 870w, http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/burganded.jpg 1301w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>(By the way, as a kid, I was terrified of that pool cleaning device you see in the background, which propelled itself slowly and menacingly around, dragging its\u00a0long tube of a tail.

Burg and Ed clearly did not share my fear.)<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of\u00a0fear: I should have known, knowing this community, that I had no reason to be afraid when I wrote the previous post. I don&#8217;t understand it, but you have always been so good to me, and this post was no exception. I&#8217;ve read every single comment, most of them more than once, and I want to thank you, a million times over, for your understanding and kindness.\u00a0What I&#8217;ve experienced is something that even\u00a0<em>I\u00a0<\/em>struggle to understand, and\u00a0your compassion\u00a0felt like a lot to ask or even hope for. But you offered it to me anyway. I am honored and astounded by what this site has become, and that has as much to do with you as it does with\u00a0me.<\/p>\n<p>A reader named Rosemary &#8211; hi, Rosemary! &#8211; left a link in the comments to the\u00a0poem <a href=\"https:\/\/www.poets.org\/poetsorg\/poem\/failing-and-flying\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Failing and Flying,&#8221; by Jack Gilbert<\/a>.\u00a0I&#8217;d not seen before, and if you&#8217;ve not seen it either, I recommend you go take a look.
