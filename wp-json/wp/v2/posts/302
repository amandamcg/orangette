It\u2019s called a macaroon tart.<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/327a9-polamactartandj1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/327a9-polamactartandj1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"435\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>(For the record, June did not eat any, but she wished she could.)<\/p>\n<p>What we have here, or what we had before we ate it all, is a buttery crust that tastes and crunches a little like shortbread, topped with hunks of soft summer fruit and a blanket of chewy macaroon. Heidi\u2019s original recipe calls for studding the tart with blackberries, but I had some beautiful apricots on the counter, so I used them instead. I also threw in a few raspberries, but I preferred the apricots. \u00a0I loved the apricots. In fact, I want to call this an <i>Apricot<\/i> Macaroon Tart. \u00a0I think I will.\u00a0And while I\u2019m in the business of making bold statements, I should say that I also took liberties with the crust.\u00a0I hope Heidi will still call me a friend.\u00a0Her\u00a0recipe calls for white whole wheat flour, but my niece Hillary is living with us this summer, and she\u2019s gluten-intolerant, so I gathered up my courage and tried making a gluten-free version of the crust.\u00a0I used a mixture of buckwheat, brown rice, and tapioca flours, and though I don\u2019t know what the tart would taste like as Heidi intended it, I liked the toasty, nutty flavor of the buckwheat so much that I now can\u2019t imagine the tart without it. Apricot, coconut, butter, buckwheat. I\u2019m in.<\/p>\n<p>Happy weekend.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Apricot Macaroon Tart<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from Heidi Swanson\u2019s <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Super-Natural-Every-Day-Well-Loved\/dp\/1580082777\/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&keywords=super%20natural%20every%20day&linkCode=ur2&qid=1373928182&sr=8-1&tag=orangette-20\" target=\"_blank\">Super Natural Every Day<\/a><\/i><\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2013-07-19T21:49:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/302?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>A word (or many words) about flour: using\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/glutenfreegirl.com\/2012\/07\/how-to-make-a-gluten-free-all-purpose-flour-mix\/\" target=\"_blank\">Shauna\u2019s 40\/60 ratio<\/a>\u00a0for gluten-free baking, I whisked up\u00a0a batch of all-purpose flour mix from 100 grams of buckwheat flour, 100 grams of brown rice flour, and 300 grams of tapioca flour. \u00a0(I then used 170 grams of this mixture in the recipe.) \u00a0I have no idea how well this mix of flours would work in other recipes, and I probably did everything wrong, but it worked nicely here, yielding a crust with a crunchy, slightly nubbly texture and great buckwheaty flavor. \u00a0The one thing that I will say, however, is that the crust wept a not-insignificant amount of butter onto the sheet pan. \u00a0I have to assume that this had something to do with the mix of flours I used, and their properties? Anyway, I doubt that the original recipe, as Heidi conceived it, has a butter-weeping problem. \u00a0In any case, consider yourself alerted. If your crust leaks a little butter onto the sheet pan, don\u2019t worry. \u00a0That\u2019s why the sheet pan is there.<\/p>\n<p>And one more word about flour: even if you do eat gluten, as I do, you really should consider using some buckwheat flour. The next time I make this tart, I might try using a mixture of buckwheat flour and standard all-purpose flour &#8211; maybe one-third buckwheat and two-thirds all-purpose? \u00a0Not that white whole wheat flour or whole wheat pastry flour are not interesting enough, but I really love what buckwheat brings to this crust.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and if you find yourself without pistachios and are contemplating a trip to the grocery store: don\u2019t worry about it. \u00a0I\u2019ve forgotten to add the pistachios both times that I\u2019ve made this tart, and though I imagine it would be prettier and maybe a little, little bit tastier with them, it\u2019s wonderful without.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, if you live in Seattle, I strongly recommend the apricots from Bill\u2019s Fruits, a stand toward the Ballard Inn end of the Ballard Farmers\u2019 Market.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n              <h3>For the crust:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd cups (170 g) white whole wheat flour, whole wheat pastry flour, or a mixture of flours (see above)\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00be cup (60 g) unsweetened finely shredded coconut\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd cup (100 g) sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            \u00bd tsp. fine sea salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            10 tablespoons (140 g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly\r          <\/div>\n                      <h3>For the filling:\r<\/h3>                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 cups (140 g) unsweetened finely shredded coconut\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1\/3 cup (70 grams) sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            Pinch of fine sea salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            4 large egg whites\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            8 ounces (225 g) fresh apricots, pitted and quartered\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1\/3 cup (45 g) pistachios, chopped          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.
