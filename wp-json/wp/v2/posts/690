I don\u2019t know what I think anymore. Let\u2019s just call this my <i>new<\/i> favorite chocolate chip cookie and leave it at that.I first heard about this recipe from <a href=\"http:\/\/wednesdaychef.typepad.com\/\">Luisa<\/a>, and then <a href=\"http:\/\/www.leciawphinney.com\/\">Lecia<\/a> mentioned it to me, too, and maybe <a href=\"http:\/\/bferry.wordpress.com\/\">Brian<\/a>, and maybe you? However it got there, it\u2019s been on my to-do list for a while, and last Friday, I decided that it was finally time to make a batch. So I did, and by Tuesday, I had decided that it was time for a second batch. That was barely 72 hours ago, but the last cookie disappeared shortly after lunch today. I did give about a third of the batch away, but still, I would like to state for the record that our household, which consists of two (2) people, put away roughly a dozen (12) cookies. I don\u2019t know exactly what I expected from a whole wheat chocolate chip cookie, but I didn\u2019t expect to want to eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<\/div>\n<div><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/81e14-peelapartwwcookies-21.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5535525585567530466\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/81e14-peelapartwwcookies-21.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1281\" height=\"1022\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nOn Wednesday, before they were all eaten, we had unseasonably good weather, and the whole house was washed in that crazy gold light that comes only in the fall, and even then only on exceptional days, and it gave me the opportunity to photograph these cookies for you in their natural state, which is to say, with halos on.<\/div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d2dfc-polawwcookies-31.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5535524246523486066\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/d2dfc-polawwcookies-31.jpg?w=246\" alt=\"\" width=\"944\" height=\"1149\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nTake my word for it. You need to try a batch. They may be built on a foundation of whole wheat flour, but they\u2019re not health food, so don\u2019t get hung up on that. They\u2019re everything that a proper chocolate chip cookie should be: tender and chewy in the middle, crisp at the edges, and very forthcoming with the chocolate. But what I like most is that, on top of all that, you also get the subtly nutty, naturally sweet-and-savory flavor of wheat. You know <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Digestive_biscuit\">digestive biscuits<\/a>? Imagine a cross between a chocolate chip cookie and a digestive biscuit. Do you read me? Am I the only American who hears the words <i>digestive<\/i> and <i>biscuit<\/i> and instantly needs a snack? I hope not. Because that\u2019s the kind of flavor we\u2019re talking about here. And that flavor, that benevolent wheaty flavor, not only tastes good, but it also performs a valuable service: it tames the sweetness and richness &#8211; that occasionally sweat-inducing intensity, if you will &#8211; that is the seldom spoken-about dark side of any chocolate chip cookie. Thank you, whole wheat. Thank you, Kim Boyce. In other words, I am sold.<\/p>\n\n<section id=\"recipe-1\" class=\"recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"http:\/\/schema.org\/Recipe\">\n  <header class=\"post-header\">\n    <div class=\"kicker\">Recipe<\/div>\n    <h2 class=\"title\" itemprop=\"name\">Whole Wheat Chocolate Chip Cookies<\/h2>\n    <h3 class=\"subtitle\">Adapted from <i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGood-Grain-Baking-Whole-Grain-Flours%2Fdp%2F1584798300&tag=orangette-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325\">Good to the Grain<\/a><\/i>, by Kim Boyce<\/h3>    <meta itemprop=\"author\" content=\"Molly\">\n    <meta itemprop=\"published\" content=\"2010-11-06T05:10:00-04:00\">\n  <\/header>\n\n      <figure class=\"hero\">\n          <\/figure>\n  \n  <div class=\"recipe-intro\" itemprop=\"summary\">\n    <nav class=\"recipe-utility-nav\">\n      <a href=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/690?print_recipe=1\" class=\"print icon-print\"><\/a>\n    <\/nav>\n    <p>Without really planning to, I\u2019ve played around quite a lot with this recipe. I\u2019ve only made it twice, but each time was in a different kitchen, with different ingredients and tools. Both times, the cookies came out beautifully. Here are some thoughts:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; A friend who had made this recipe suggested that I try making it with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kingarthurflour.com\/shop\/items\/king-arthur-white-whole-wheat-flour-5-lb\">white whole wheat flour<\/a>, so I bought a fresh bag and used it in my first batch. I loved the resulting flavor \u2013 lightly wheaty, almost bran-like \u2013 and I highly recommend it. For my second batch, I used a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stone-buhr.com\/flours\/whole-wheat-flour\/\">local brand<\/a> of whole wheat flour, and it was plenty nice, but the wheat flavor was darker and heartier. If you\u2019re after that digestive biscuit flavor, I would use white whole wheat flour.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Because I am apparently getting ornery with age, I ignored Boyce\u2019s advice to use cold butter. I honestly thought it was a typo, because I\u2019ve always had a hard time creaming butter that\u2019s even a little bit too cold. Instead, I used softened butter. (I left it at room temperature until it was still cool to the touch but took the imprint of a finger when I pressed it. Perfect for creaming.) It worked just fine, as you can see. But I\u2019ve now done some poking around online and see that the recipe <i>is<\/i> indeed supposed to use cold butter, cubed for easier creaming. Oops! So, uh, never mind me. Do whatever you want.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The original recipe calls for chopped bittersweet chocolate, and I tried it once that way and once with bittersweet chips. (I used Ghirardelli 60% chocolate in both cases.) I preferred the chopped chocolate because the pieces were smaller, so it gave the sense that there was more chocolate. But if you want to keep it quick and simple, chips will do the job.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; I made this dough once in a stand mixer and once with handheld electric beaters. The poor beaters had to labor a lot, and I wound up recruiting a sturdy spatula to help out, but it\u2019s good to know that you can make do with whatever tools you have on hand.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Boyce says that this dough is designed to be baked without chilling first. (This, I think, is linked to her use of cold butter. The cold butter likely keeps the dough cool and helps it spread less in the oven.) But I apparently am not only ornery; I also can\u2019t follow directions. I scooped my dough, put it on a sheet pan, covered it with plastic wrap, and chilled it before baking. Some of the dough was chilled for about 1 hour, and some stayed in the fridge for two days. Chilling dough generally results in a thicker cookie, and mine were certainly nice and plump, which I like. So I recommend chilling the dough. And hey, I also noticed that the cookies that stayed in the fridge for two days were particularly flavorful. So \u201caging\u201d the dough a bit isn\u2019t a bad idea, either.<\/p>\n  <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\"recipe-list\">\n                                <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            3 cups whole wheat flour (see note above)\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd tsp. baking powder\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tsp. baking soda\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 \u00bd tsp. kosher salt\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 sticks (8 oz.) unsalted butter, cut into \u00bd-inch cubes (see note above)\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 cup lightly packed dark brown sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 cup sugar\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            2 large eggs\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            1 tsp. vanilla extract\r          <\/div>\n                  <div class=\"ingredient\" itemprop=\"ingredients\">\n            8 oz. bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped into \u00bc- and \u00bd-inch pieces, or bittersweet chips          <\/div>\n                  <\/div>\n  \n      <div itemprop=\"instructions\">\n      <p>Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven, and preheat to 350\u00b0F.

(If you have no parchment, you can butter the sheets.)<\/p>\n<p>Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl, and whisk to blend.<\/p>\n<p>Put the butter and sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on low speed, mix just until the butter and sugars are blended, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla. Add the flour mixture to the bowl, and blend on low speed until the flour is just incorporated. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Add the chocolate, and mix on low speed until evenly combined. (If you have no stand mixer, you can do all of this with handheld electric beaters and\/or a large, sturdy spoon.) Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl, and then use your hands to turn and gently massage the dough, making sure all the flour is absorbed.<\/p>\n<p>Scoop mounds of dough about 3 tablespoons in size onto the baking sheets, leaving about 3 inches between each cookie. (I was able to fit about 8 cookies on each sheet, staggering them in three rows.)<\/p>\n<p>Bake the cookies for 16 to 20 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through, until the cookies are evenly browned. Transfer the cookies, still on parchment, to a rack to cool. Repeat with remaining dough.<\/p>\n<p>These cookies are very good while still warm from the oven, but I find that you can taste the wheat more \u2013 in a good way \u2013 once they\u2019ve cooled.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: about 20 cookies<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I know this cookie looks wholesome.
