And in case you can\u2019t get a coveted reservation for one of these evenings, you should know that the restaurant is also open for lunch Monday through Friday and for catered events as well. <\/p>\n<p>This week I had the immense pleasure of nabbing a seat at the Guest Chef Night featuring Ethan Stowell of the remarkable <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/09\/unionized-pre-birthdays.html\">Union<\/a>, one of my favorite spots in town. Keaton was to join me, but a last-minute invitation for a free trip to Thailand\u2014<em>how does this sort of thing happen?!\u2014<\/em>stole her away. I instead wound up squeezing into a table of fellow food nerds from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.egullet.org\/\">eGullet<\/a> and was thrilled to find myself there, amongst fifteen <strong>raucous, chatty near-strangers<\/strong>. <\/p>\n<p>The restaurant was full to the brim, buzzing and warm on a rainy night. Our evening began with the graduation of one of FareStart\u2019s students, which elicited much <strong>applause and general good cheer<\/strong>. Ethan Stowell was introduced, and I successfully resisted the urge to throw myself at his feet. Our enormous eGullet table was singled out and thanked for much support and foodie enthusiasm. Pride all around. And, of course, dinner was delicious: <\/p>\n<p>-A very delicate chilled heirloom tomato soup with a large poached sea scallop (tender, rare), garnished with finely chopped chives and a few dribbles of olive oil <\/p>\n<p>-A small round of roasted beef loin (perfectly rare, buttery, melty) perched on a crispy disk of saut\u00e9ed Parmesan-enriched polenta and splashed with a shallot sauce, whose hint of balsamic vinegar cut the richness of the beef beautifully <\/p>\n<p>-Vanilla bean panna cotta (creamy, aromatic, refreshing) with peach soup and blueberries <\/p>\n<p>Yes, this bounty for $19.95, plus tax, tip, and beverage\u2014and <strong>all proceeds to the best of causes<\/strong>. Get yourself to FareStart. It\u2019s enough to leave a girl positively glowing, satisfied in so many ways. And the bagful of free chanterelles (from two eGulleteers who\u2019d been out foraging only that afternoon) didn\u2019t hurt either. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I can&#8217;t keep it to myself.
