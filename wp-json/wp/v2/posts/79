Either they\u2019re too sweet, too far removed from the fruit they once were, or they\u2019re the type that markets itself as low-sugar, which usually means that the flavor is flat, vaguely brown-tasting. Bah. If I happen to be in a market that has high-end, small-batch jam, like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.junetaylorjams.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">June Taylor<\/a>, that\u2019s a whole other story. That stuff is incredible: clean-tasting, softly set, full of bright fruit. (Santa Rosa Plum and Tayberry Conserve!!!) But it\u2019s also so expensive, so so so expensive, that I can\u2019t bring myself to use it in my, or my child\u2019s, peanut butter sandwich. I feel more inclined to use it as currency than to actually eat it. That\u2019s why, whenever I can, I try to make jam. I can make it exactly the way I want it.

I am also not a canning expert. But almost ten years ago, my friends <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2005\/08\/on-picking-prattling-on-and-preserving.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kate and Margot<\/a> taught me their favorite jam formula, which Margot learned from an older family friend in Italy, and between it, a few other recipes I\u2019ve tried, a few <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/River-Cottage-Preserves-Handbook\/dp\/158008172X\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=river%20cottage%20preserves&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1412708871&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=4QCF32AK6QR7DSCL\" target=\"_blank\">cookbooks<\/a> I\u2019ve read, and trial and error, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve figured out.<\/p>\n<p>1. I like jams that use a 2:1 fruit-to-sugar ratio. When you\u2019re measuring it out, it looks like a terrifying amount of sugar, but stay strong, hold firm, because most of the time, it will yield a jam that\u2019s just right. The sugar not only preserves the fruit, of course, but it plays a big role in drawing out its flavor. Use too little sugar, and the flavor and color will be dull. Jam is not a place to go on a no-sugar diet.<\/p>\n<p>2. This is a personal thing, but: the best jams are the simplest. You can fancy them up with tea leaves, hibiscus flowers, spices, blah dee blah, but my goal in making jam is to taste the fullest flavor of the fruit itself. The only things I put in my jam are fruit, sugar, and fresh lemon juice. God, I\u2019m a cranky old lady. I annoy even myself.<\/p>\n<p>3. To check my jam for doneness, I like the saucer test, which I describe in the recipe instructions. Read on. (I should also mention that the jam below looks more liquidy than it actually is. It was sort of sinking into the yogurt. Anyway, the photo above is a better representation of the consistency of the jam, if you want a visual aid.)<\/p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/bf39f-_f7a4374-41.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/bf39f-_f7a4374-41.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>In short, THANK YOU, MICHELE AND GARY!

(If your schedule makes this tricky, don\u2019t worry: you can let the mixture sit longer, if needed. I\u2019ve let it hang out for up to 4 or 5 hours.)<\/p>\n<p>While the fruit is hanging out, wash the jars, lids, and rings in hot, soapy water, so that they\u2019re perfectly clean, and then put the jars (upright) on a rimmed sheet pan. Lay the lids and rings on a clean towel to dry completely. Put a few saucers in the freezer; you\u2019ll need these later, for testing the jam.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly before you begin cooking the jam, preheat the oven to 225\u00b0F, and slide the sheet pan of jars into the preheated oven. It will need to stay there for 30 minutes to sterilize the jars. (I find this oven method easier than boiling the empty jars, because I used to always splash boiling water everywhere when I was lifting them out to fill them. But do whatever you prefer. Or, you can entirely skip this sterilizing-before-filling step, because, as it turns out, safety experts no longer consider it necessary. When in doubt, <a href=\"http:\/\/nchfp.uga.edu\/publications\/uga\/uga_jams_jellies.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">this<\/a> is a great resource.)<\/p>\n<p>After you put the jars in the oven, take out a large pot, place a rack inside of it, fill it with water, and set it over high heat. (I use a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Andersons-Baking-Cooling-Round-4-Inch\/dp\/B000HM9TGM\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=round%20cooling%20rack&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1412714524&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=FGB6T3YPHKQ72QBX\" target=\"_blank\">round cooling rack<\/a>; <a href=\"http:\/\/foodinjars.com\/2013\/07\/new-to-canning-start-here-boiling-water-bath-canning\/\" target=\"_blank\">Marisa<\/a> uses <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Spice-Ratchet-16813-Multi-Use-Silicone\/dp\/B005FPD6X8\/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1412714434&amp;s=kitchen&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=6DQ4OSFM3Q2YDC32\" target=\"_blank\">a silicone trivet<\/a>; and you can also use a folded dish towel, though it tends to float until you put jars on top of it.) The pot must be large enough to hold 4 or 5 jars in a single layer, and the water should be deep enough to cover the jars by 1 or 2 inches. You\u2019ll want it to be simmering by the time the jam has finished cooking, because you\u2019ll use it for processing the filled jam jars.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re ready to cook the jam, place the pot of fruit over medium-high heat, and bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Soon, you\u2019ll notice a pale-colored foam rise to the surface. Use a spoon or a skimmer to remove as much of the foam as possible. Keep the jam rolling along at a boil, stirring frequently to prevent scorching, and keep an eye on it: first it will be very juicy, and then it will start to cook down ever so slightly, the texture unifying, the color darkening, the surface glossy. Around this point, maybe 20 minutes into cooking, it will probably also start sputtering like lava when you stir it: be careful! That scary sputtering is how I know to start testing the jam for doneness. It probably won\u2019t be ready on the first try, but it\u2019s good to get a feel for it.<\/p>\n<p><b>How to test for doneness<\/b>: In general, the setting point for jam is 220\u00b0F, so you can test by taking its temperature as it boils: when it hits 220\u00b0F, it\u2019s generally ready. <i>However<\/i>, that said, pectin-rich fruits set at a slightly lower temperature, so if you always just sit back and let your jam go to 220\u00b0F, you could wind up with a too-stiff jam. I prefer to use a more tactile test for doneness: the saucer test. Here\u2019s how to do it:<\/p>\n<p>Take the pot off the heat while you test it. Take 1 saucer out of the freezer, and dribble a little jam on it, maybe a silver dollar-sized puddle. Return the saucer to the freezer for 15 seconds or so, so that the puddle of jam is neither warm nor cold. Then remove the saucer from the freezer, and sweep a fingertip through the jam: does it feel like it\u2019s developing a certain solidity, as <a href=\"http:\/\/foodinjars.com\/2010\/07\/canning-101-how-to-ensure-that-your-jam-sets\/\" target=\"_blank\">Marisa<\/a> explains, so that your finger leaves a trail? Or, on the other hand, is the jam still runny, so that it quickly runs to fill in the trail? If it\u2019s the latter, the jam isn\u2019t quite ready, so return the pot to the heat, stirring, and test again in a few minutes. The jam is ready when your finger <i>just begins<\/i> to leave a clean trail. Another indication is that when you tilt the saucer, the jam slides very slowly, not quickly. It won\u2019t look like jam, per se, quite yet &#8211; it\u2019ll be softer, gloppier than that &#8211; but it will continue to thicken as it cools. (When in doubt, err on the side of undercooking, I\u2019d say. You can always use it as a syrup on pancakes! You\u2019ll nail it next time!)<\/p>\n<p>When the jam is ready, remove the sheet pan from the oven. Working carefully \u2013 the jars and the jam are very hot! \u2013 use a ladle to divide the jam among the jars, leaving \u00bc inch of room at the top. (A batch of jam will probably fill 4 jars, and maybe 5, but I like to sterilize 6 jars, just to be safe.) Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean, damp cloth to remove any drips. Put the lids and rings on, taking care to screw them just until they are snug (not crazy-tight). Use tongs or a jar lifter to carefully place the jars, standing upright, on the rack in the pot of simmering water. Bring it up to a boil, and boil for 10 minutes. Remove the jars (carefully!) with tongs or a jar lifter, set them on a rack, and leave them alone to cool completely. As the jars cool, you may hear little pops: that\u2019s the lids sealing. When they\u2019re cool, press each lid lightly to make sure it has sealed: it should curve downward very slightly in the middle. Properly sealed jam is safe to store at room temperature, but refrigerate after opening.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n  \n      <p itemprop=\"yield\">Yield: 4 or 5 (8-ounce) jars<\/p>\n  <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In early September, a kind reader in north-central Idaho left me a comment.
