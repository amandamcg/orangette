It\u2019s an incredible place: just six one-room cabins, a cottage, a farmhouse, a garden, and a couple of woodsheds on 48 acres, dedicated solely giving women the time, space, and quiet to write, free of charge. (!) (!!) At the end of each day, at 5:30 pm, the six or seven writers in residence gather in the farmhouse kitchen to share a meal cooked for them by one of Hedgebrook\u2019s chefs, with ingredients largely harvested from the garden. And afterward, they each take their flashlight and a basket of breakfast makings and lunch and walk back to their cabins in the trees, and no one disturbs them, or comes looking for them, or asks anything of them, and definitely, <i>definitely<\/i> no one there needs a diaper change or wakes up crying in the middle of the night, and this superlative quiet continues until 5:30 pm the next day, when the writers meet for dinner again, walk home with their baskets again, etc. etc. etc. (!!!) \u00a0I try not to use the word <i>magic<\/i> too often<i>, <\/i>not unless the topic is actual magic, magical magic.

I don\u2019t usually do PR stuff; it\u2019s not what I like to write about. But I had heard about Hedgebrook years ago from a photographer friend of my mom\u2019s, and I had thought about applying to be a writer in residence someday, but I was too intimidated to do it.
