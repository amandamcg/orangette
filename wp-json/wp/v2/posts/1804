I\u2019d gone over early to provide costume consultation and get a head start on the (yes, post-season) gin and tonic.

The guests arrived in full regalia, among them a few nuns, a priest with lipstick marks on his cheeks, a hideously fake-sunburned tourist, a one-night stand, a stockpile of weapons of mass destruction, a meat market, and even Uncle Sam. Todd came as lean, mean boxing champ \u201cT-Bone,\u201d and <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2004\/10\/like-leaves_03.html\">Margot<\/a> played his manager, complete with <strong>cigar, driving cap, and hairy chest<\/strong>. Nicho stayed closer to home as an arborist, lugging a very heavy chainsaw and smelling of pine. I dusted; I drank; I fortified myself with cheese. We schmoozed; we reveled.<\/p>\n<p>All this to say that the next morning I was rather hungry, as is only fitting. We decided to grab a bite to eat and then go for a walk in Discovery Park to soak up the picture-perfect fall day. I steered Nicho toward <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lonelyplanet.com\/mapshells\/north_america\/seattle\/seattle.htm\">Fremont<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/seattle.citysearch.com\/profile\/10774471\/seattle_wa\/longshoreman_s_daughter.html?cslink=roundup_name_noncust&amp;ulink=roundup__roundupentity2-1_1__0_profile_2_1\">Longshoreman\u2019s Daughter<\/a>, home of dark and nutty blueberry-buckwheat pancakes. But there were massive crowds outside, and Nicho suggested that we <strong>\u201cjust drive around and find someplace\u201d<\/strong> to eat. He pointed the car haphazardly in the direction of Ballard and told me to &#8220;<strong>be adventurous<\/strong>.&#8221; We quickly sped away from Fremont and into industrial no man&#8217;s land. I was ravenous, and I quietly fumed as we drove by more brunch spots with hordes outside. I tried to protest, grew hungrier, and fumed more aggressively, but he wouldn&#8217;t take any of my suggestions. Now, I know what I&#8217;m talking about when I make a dining proposal; one should <em>not<\/em>, under any circumstances, drive around aimlessly and wave off advice while my stomach loudly grumbles from the passenger seat.<\/p>\n<p>I finally succeeded in steering him to <a href=\"http:\/\/seattle.citysearch.com\/profile\/11477093\/?cslink=cs_boc_ew_3_4\">Caf\u00e9 Besalu<\/a>, but he didn&#8217;t want to wait in line and, by this point, was feeling lunch-ish. We wound up crossing the street to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.qfconline.com\/\">QFC<\/a> for picnic supplies. Admittedly, a picnic should have sounded like fun, but I was <em>far<\/em> beyond feeling easygoing and adventurous and instead <strong>moped silently next to the refrigerator case of deli salads.<\/strong> Bravely taking charge of the situation, Nicho chose an Essential Baking Company seeded baguette and picked out some highly questionable day-glo orange smoked cheese. Armed with these and some fruit (including the first of winter\u2019s citruses, a box of Satsuma mandarins), we headed out to Discovery Park.<\/p>\n<p>It was absolutely gorgeous, and we picnicked under a cloudless blue sky. I stealthily avoided the calamity cheese, but he didn&#8217;t seem to notice, and anyway, there\u2019s no need for loud mean-spiritedness, especially given that I&#8217;d been too grumpy at QFC to be of any cheese-choosing help. The air was cold and smelled like fall, a delicious contrast to the warm sun on my face, and we walked down to the beach and let Index romp illegally on the sand. I calmed down and even felt cheerful and appreciative. I was secretly proud of myself. But Nicho learned his lesson: no one\u2014but <em>no one<\/em>\u2014escapes the wrath of my hunger.<\/p>\n<p>Halloween drew to a close with a very satisfying reconciliation dinner of lamb sausages and cold beer. [<strong>Oh lamb sausage, I&#8217;d eat sleep breathe nothing but you, <\/strong>but I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;d ooze grease and outgrow my fishnets. Maybe this blog should have been called &#8220;Sausagette&#8221;?] By way of accompaniment, we roasted acorn squash and red peppers, saut\u00e9ed red onions, and made a big salad of farmers\u2019 market lettuces and shaved fennel. We then watched <em>The Shining<\/em>, which Nicho had never seen before. He was terrified and tense and spent the majority of the movie clinging to my side, reminding me that he\u2019s \u201cnot a horror-movie person.\u201d I patted his hand reassuringly. Adventurous indeed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I do not take well to being hungry, especially when the source of my next meal is unknown. Consider yourself warned.
