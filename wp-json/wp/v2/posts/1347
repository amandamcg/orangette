I did. I was going to tell you about another cookie today, and a really good one too. But a visitor has been staying with us lately, and he won\u2019t let me into the kitchen. He\u2019s big and burly, 90,000 words tall. His name is <a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.blogspot.com\/2007\/10\/nitty-gritties.html\">Man U. Script<\/a>, and he\u2019s a bruiser.

For pure satisfaction, writing a book is hard to beat. But the other night I had the scariest dream. In it, I was meeting my editor for the first time &#8211; which I\u2019ll do next week, when Brandon and I go to New Jersey\u00a0for Christmas &#8211; and in this dream, much to my terror, <em>my editor turned out to be Anna Wintour<\/em>. You know &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediabistro.com\/fishbowlny\/original\/wintour1606_narrowweb__300x452,0.jpg\">Anna Wintour<\/a>, the editor of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Vogue<\/span> magazine, she of the impeccably shiny bob? She was holding my manuscript and sneering, sneering with her whole face, and then she sighed and said, \u201cHmmm. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Well<\/span>. I suppose it\u2019ll have to do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I woke up sweating.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/05720-thursday032-11.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5142438556006595826\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/orangette.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/05720-thursday032-11.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1064\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nSo I don\u2019t have any cookies for you this week.
