					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly &lt;br /&gt;I am glad to read this, because I have the same feeling about working in a kitchen, the rush, the stress, it really does not have to do anything with cooking at all. Even though I did work in a rather small and nice restaurant, working in the kitchen really did destroy my creativity while cooking. Now, after a 2-year break from working in the kitchen I have started to like cooking again. And also your homepage, that makes cooking &quot;human&quot; again, has helped me to recover. Kind regards, and keep your creativity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I&#039;m so glad to read that you are back doing what you are meant to do! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started reading your blog just before you started the restaurant. My heart sank - I made the mistake of attempting culinary school (actually at our local community college) recently. After that exhausting and physically painful experience, I realized that I was not meant for the restaurant business. Although I&#039;m older than you, I think, I felt a similarity through your writing... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is, be who you are! You both can blossom in the areas where you are meant to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So good to see you back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this with Morningstar Farms soy bacon instead, as a vegetarian option.  Frying the &quot;bacon&quot; in butter gave it a nice flavor, but strange texture.  I might try microwaving the bacon and letting it cool/harden before frying it next time.  Tasty.]]></description>
