					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, BaydraOtis!  These photos are all Polaroids - real ones, not digital approximations - that I scan and upload.  I do use PhotoShop to edit out dust and the like, but otherwise, this is what they look like!  Polaroid film is terrific.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had some of this dressing left after tossing it with potatoes and green beans a few nights.  So, I drizzled the rest over a salad of sliced tomatoes mixed with parsley and feta cheese. And, I topped it off with some balsamic vinaigrette.  It was pretty amazing.  Thanks for the recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to say that I didn&#039;t even finish reading this post before I got up to make the recipe! It was delicious; I poured it over everything... the roasted new potatoes, the heirloom tomatoes and the tiny piece of steak. Here&#039;s a photo of how it turned out: http://su.pr/5C3zCB]]></description>
