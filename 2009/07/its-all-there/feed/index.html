					<description><![CDATA[I have owned two restaurants, both insane, busy and fun.  This year is my 11th but those first years are etched on my memory.  Your posts brought it all rushing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The years when you are always mopping the floors and fixing the machines.  I sweep to clear my mind after a mad rush.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I laughed so hard at the head exploding comment.  I know that feeling well.  Your description of the time just before dinner is wonderful and true although I have never articulated it...the one time of the day when the restaurant is calm, clean and the potential for a perfect night is in the air.  Cheers to you both.  Enjoy the journey.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My husband broke his leg on holiday in France and found Orangette by accident while recovering.  What an inspiration, what a happy find.  I love your philosophy on life and food, I want to sit and read all your previous articles but I&#039;ve got to go and cook dinner.  I will return frequently (I&#039;ve got some catching up to do) and I look forward to reading your book which he said he would buy for me as a gift for looking after him!  Thank you for this lovely thing.]]></description>
