					<description><![CDATA[Hey Molly&lt;br /&gt;Just finished your book A Homemade Life and you can&#039;t imagine my surprise when I saw the bread and chocolate recipe and the radishes and butter recipe. My mother is French and I used to spend summers with my grandparents in a little French village near Poitiers and every day at 4 o&#039;clock my grandmother would give us &quot;gouter&quot; which was a chunk of fresh bread from the baguette we had just bought from the boulangerie across the street and a piece of dark chocolate. I&#039;ve tried to replicate it for friends but it&#039;s very difficult without the right bread. Even bakeries who claim to bake &quot;French&quot; bread never bake it long enough and it&#039;s never as crispy on the outside or as full of holes on the inside as the geunuine article is. Enjoyed your book very much and many of the French recipes were very familiar to me. If I&#039;m ever in Seattle I will definitey come to your restaurant. I hope you are able to cook the food you want there with the horrendous mainstream food supply that is available to us Americans.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just received your book as a birthday present and I have been savoring it bit by bit!  I have been enjoying your articles in Bon Appetit for years and am thrilled to find your blog!  Your writing reminds me so much of Laurie Colwin, (whose books I read over and over!)  Good luck with the restaurant I&#039;m looking forward to hearing more about it and hopefully getting there one day!]]></description>
