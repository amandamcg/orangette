					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed on twitter that you said you would get the recipe for your cousin&#039;s olive oil cake.  Do you think she would mind if you posted it?  I would love to have a good recipe for olive oil cake -- it sounds wonderful ....&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, hi! I can&#039;t believe I haven&#039;t yet been over to your restaurant (soon--I&#039;m am dying to come visit!). I hear you on the life-balance front. The restaurant sounds like a baby, and I know babies (two). xoxo]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#039;t worry about not posting -- it has forced me to discover other food blogs that I love!  When I first started reading your blog last year I loved it and still&lt;br /&gt;do, but now I read so many other blogs that I never&lt;br /&gt;knew existed.  Thanks so much and good luck to you&lt;br /&gt;and Brandon with your new restaurant -- I&#039;ve heard the food is wonderful there!]]></description>
