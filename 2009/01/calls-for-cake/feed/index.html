					<description><![CDATA[My mom called early this morning to ask for a recipe &quot; not too complicated , but complicated enough to please her guests &quot;  go figure .. after 20 seconds of silence over the phone,  I remembered this recipe that I had made a couple of months ago when apples were only starting to show up at the farmers market. Ding! Ding! Ding!   I know it would be perfect tonight served with vanilla ice cream or old fashioned creme fraiche!  Mission accomplished]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sarah, ack!  I&#039;ve not had that problem, though I can imagine how it could happen: this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a pretty weird topping.  When you say that it was eggy, do you mean flavor-wise, or texture-wise?  Was it inedible because the egg was runny?  If it&#039;s a flavor issue, I&#039;m not sure what went wrong.  But if it&#039;s that the topping was runny or strangely textured, I do wonder if it&#039;s an oven issue.  Or, another idea:  it&#039;s crucial to beat the egg very well, so that it&#039;s evenly yellow and no streaks of clear white or blobs of yolk are visible.  I can imagine that, if the egg wasn&#039;t well beaten, it could cook into something terrible and scrambled egg-like...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;m sorry that it didn&#039;t work out, and I wish I could be more helpful!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made this cake and it wasn&#039;t very successful. It was all fine except for the topping, it was distinctly eggy. I&#039;m really sad about it because I can tell that underneath the eggyness it is a great cake! But it was really inedible. I&#039;m not sure why this happened and I was wondering if you had any ideas? Maybe my oven wasn&#039;t hot enough? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah x]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My father came by my house the other day with a sack filled with apples from my sister&#039;s yard requesting that I make him a pie.  Since it was his birthday, I decided to comply.   I wasn&#039;t keen on making pie crust that day, so I decided to check in on your blog and see what alternatives you might have to offer (I have just discovered you, having found and loved your book).   I came across this recipe and decided to try it.   It was perfect!  I served it with vanilla ice cream -- everyone, particularly my little girls, just loved it.  I am really eager to make it again and use it as my go-to dessert offering.  Thanks so much.]]></description>
