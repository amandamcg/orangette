					<description><![CDATA[Wow! Iâ€™m here from the future! 2020. A year that will live in infamy. Iâ€™ve made this soup several times since Molly pasted in 2009. Again, it is New Yearâ€™s Eve and Iâ€™ve planned to serve this elegant soup. I check in to reread and confirm the steps. So many things have changed since Gourmet magazine printed this recipe and Mollyâ€™s subsequent post. Yet, lucky times and prosperous times have happened too. This time my husband I will enjoy caviar as a first course- sustainability farmed in North Carolina!- but weâ€™ll toast away the old year, as weâ€™ve done in yearâ€™s past. Weâ€™ll welcome 2021 and say a prayer for those lost. As MF a blessing for a better 2021. And a wish for good years, and blessings for all, s as nd the opportunity to enjoy Mollyâ€™s Scallop Soup again in 2022.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh sorry, I forgot to add one thing!  I lived in Paris for years and am now an expat in another foreign city - Hong Kong.  Its been unseasonably &quot;cold&quot; here, so I was nostalgically craving Parisian food (don&#039;t ask)!  Anyway, this this beautiful soup really made my day.  Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this soup last weekend and it was great!  I too added a bit more stock (not home made but still wonderful).  I don&#039;t know how it would feed four though. :O  We had enough for two small bowls as it is VERY rich but as a treat, well it was just that.  Thank you for inspiring us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Made this the night before last with my friend here in her tiny kitchen in Rennes.  It was delicious, though I did add a bit more stock that it called for because it was a bit too creamy for me and my annoyingly delicate stomach (for all things deep-fried and cream-filled).&lt;/&gt;However, I do have to ask how in the heck you managed to serve 4 people with this!  I mean, we gobbled down the entire pot between the two of us, and that was with salad and sanglier saucisson.  Apparently, I eat too much ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hooray for peanut butter and jelly.  I have found that when i crave old faithful pbj but push it aside because it&#039;s common, easy and maybe too .... i just end up eating two at a time later.  pbj is just a perfect food, particularly when toasted up so the outside gets crisp and the insides melt together.... so although good for you for giving up store-bought sliced bread, i think peanut butter and jelly sandwiches should always be relished and enjoyed to the full.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is some sort of mysterious connection between scallops and cream... in fact scallops are one of the few proteins that you can blend with cream to make a properly emulsified mousseline without adding egg whites as a protein binder. Can&#039;t tell you the science behind it, but I suspect the relationship transcends mere science and enters the realm of magic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nage de Scallop a la creme? Sorry can&#039;t seem to be able to do accents!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I just found your blog Molly: this is going to be such a treat going through older post! and read not only the recipe, but more importantly the &quot;stories&quot;. This is going to be like a good book: Read the prequels, and there are sequels coming. What fun!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Sylvie&lt;/&gt;http://www.LaughingDuckGardens.com/ldblog.php/]]></description>
