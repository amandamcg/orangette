					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, I love your site and your book and I happen to leave a comment under the auspices of celery root which I find kind of funny cause I&#039;m not particularly fond of the gnarly veggie. I just stashed the salad in the fridge. I took the liberty of adding some grated apple, despite loud protests from the mayo and the mustard and the yoghurt... I&#039;m writing to test the waters further, should I expect your protests too:)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, so I read your blog religiously, on Tuesdays, saving it until I come home from a long day of begging high school kids to care about the beauty of the French language.  I never comment, but couldn&#039;t resist today as I was reading back through old posts (looking for butterscotch cookies).  I managed to overlook that you referenced my favorite scene from Persepolis in this post!  I just had to tell you that it made my day.  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ah yes, dear old celeri-remoulade, with a slice of home-made pate and some crusty homemade country bread and some homemade wine... oops? cross out homemade wine. But yeah, so many of the table pleasures are the simple things made with care!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I grew celeriac for the first time this year and learned that (1)it must be watered (unlike, say, tomatoes!) (2) it must be harvested before hard frost (unlike say, carrots!). Live and learn.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Sylvie&lt;/&gt;http://www.LaughingDuckGardens.com/ldblog.php/&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;PS: I often put finely chopped cornichons in my celeri-remoulade.]]></description>
