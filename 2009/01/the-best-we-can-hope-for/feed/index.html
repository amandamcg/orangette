					<description><![CDATA[Tried this last night - squeezed in a whole lime and added fresh ginger, garlic, and green onion. It was so great and ended up tasting a little like pad thai! 1/2 cabbage was the perfect portion to serve two people. 

Also added 1/2 cup of brown rice once it was plated to help soak up the extra juices and add some more texture. 

Sprinkled shaved roasted almonds on top for a little crunch!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was just looking for a recipe to use cabbage in and I was treated to the moodiest cabbage cooking method of all time. I was unprepared for the melancholy and nostalgia! Day made, thank you. Hope all is well 9 years later!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So simple but delicious! I want to make it again already. I used sliced onion instead of fennel. I think this would be great with a little bacon added.... mmmm]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loves me some fried cabbage. I think it&#039;s my German-Russian background. My default setting for fried cabbage, though, is bacon and onions. I was raised on beroch, a bun stuffed with fried cabbage, bacon, onions and tons of black pepper, made by my great-grandmother. My mom also made something she always called &#039;lazy-man&#039;s cabbage rolls,&#039; which I now recognize as more of a cabbage fried rice. &lt;br /&gt;Just fry up a good handful or so chopped bacon, then to the crisp bacon and rendered fat, add a diced half an onion and a half a small cabbage, sliced thinly. Season well with black pepper. Once the cabbage has cooked down a bit, add in cooked rice - leftover from the night before is best. Freshly cooked rice tends to be a bit too moist. Stir well over the heat, letting the rice fry up a bit and warm though, then generously season with Chinese/dark soy sauce. If I have them, I also toss in a handfull of frozen peas.&lt;br /&gt;When I make this, I have to limit how many bowls I will let myself eat in one sitting, being sure to leave some for the next day - it&#039;s just as good reheated the next day. &lt;br /&gt;Yum.&lt;br /&gt;Fried cabbage + hot sauce = something new I think I&#039;m gonna like.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made this for the first time last week (and then promptly followed it with a second making).  I subbed white onion for the fennel the second time around and it was still lovely.  I would never have thought of combining these flavors and it was so soul-satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks :)]]></description>
