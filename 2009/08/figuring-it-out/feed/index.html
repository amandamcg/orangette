					<description><![CDATA[Hey there Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you are having happy holidays...things are dandy here (92 year grandmother plus parents to stay for two whole weeks, gulp) and my mother just made the tomato and cilantro stem soup for us this evening for dinner.  It was magnificent.  She of course had to vary it slightly, as is her wont (fresh tomatoes peeled and de-seeded as well as the can).  We put our own homemade creme fraiche into it and all sighed as our cold noses warmed up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the excellent recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found an episode of your blog about jam, and also read the comments for extra learning (it was I who mentioned the disappearance of the jam article from the BA website after your last post), but I am still a little clueless on a particular point: years ago we got some baskets of bitter oranges which we made into the best ever marmalade, as the oranges came with a recipe from the family whose trees gave us the oranges.  But for the life of me I can&#039;t remember what to do about the peel...did we cook it with all the peel? or just the zest, but chunky? or no peel whatsoever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We now have other friends with a laden orange tree in their garden who have offered us a generous share of their booty but what do we do about the peel?  Do you have a suggestion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the by are you shutting the restaurant for a break over the hols. or are you keeping right on going?  Which ever, I hope this period is productive and fun, sometimes relaxing and always inspiring and filled with love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tanti saluti cordiali di Pola x]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For the past six months or so, I have loved going back and reading about your experiences in Seattle.  A UW alum and Ballard native currently living in Los Angeles, your tales of Seattle keep me homesick =)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a great experience at the restaurant back in August. Though the wait was lengthy, the staff made sure we were set with a bottle of wine to enjoy. Even with 6 of us crowded around the little table by the window - it was the perfect place to enjoy a cool breeze and our pizza!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good Golly, Miss Molly! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have to comment on the cookies with the gray salt picture. They look even more nubb-y-licious and crackly than usual (based on the pictures from your &quot;some cookies&quot; post and the ones I churn out). Other than the addition of Gray salt rather than Maldon/fleur de sel, did you tweak it in any other ways? Spill it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooking involves evolution and I want to know if you&#039;ve found a way to make this masterpiece of a dessert stand a little more &quot;erectus&quot; (Anthro Quip!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I read your book twice and sobbed both times-absolutely lovely! thank you for sharing your story and love of culinary culture!!!]]></description>
