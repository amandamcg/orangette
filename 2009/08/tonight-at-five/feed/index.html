					<description><![CDATA[Hey, get your rubber stamp made just like your handwritten one. Like it, it&#039;s handmade, like the restaurant, like the food. There&#039;s something honest about it. It&#039;d look good in neon too, hanging out front. Congrats]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations!  Everything sounds delicious, and I can&#039;t wait to visit next time I&#039;m in Seattle.  Will you please relate to Brandon that Zoë the cellist from his Oberlin days is glad that you have &quot;Zoe&#039;s Pepperoni,&quot; and that I wish you both good cheer?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seriously, seriously great value wine. At only $7 a bottle, buy a case of this one. It&#039;s quite complex for a &quot;cheap&quot; wine, and it&#039;s sure to please just about anyone. Despite it&#039;s crisp acidity, it&#039;s medium-bodied, which is surprising in the mouth. Very balanced, and sips nicely by itself, or with food. What a nice surprise! Really loved this wine.It gives ultimate pleasure with Cuban cigars which i buy from online &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.royalhabanos.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cigar Shop&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found your blog off of someone else&#039;s blog, and as I was reading about your restaurant and looking at the photos, and seeing what&#039;s on your menu, I was thinking, &quot;Man, I wish there were restaurants like this here. Delancy sounds &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; good.&quot; And then I read further on in the post and I found that, not only are you in Seattle with me, but you&#039;re in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;my neighborhood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! Wow! I can&#039;t wait to come by. Tomorrow! Yay!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this simple and delicious dessert right after you posted the recipe. They were wonderful and my husband nicknamed them &quot;Plowed Peaches&quot; for the very winey sweetness that developed after keeping them in the fridge for a few hours! Thanks for the recipe.]]></description>
