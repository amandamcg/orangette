Happy you have it now!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No one could ever regret trying this :-)  I&#039;ve made two batches for gifts this year and we&#039;ve enjoyed a few errant handfuls but I see a batch &quot;just for us&quot; happening in the near future.  Great stuff!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, Just wanted to say that I made this TWICE last year, recommended it to a friend who made it and loved it, and will be making it again this year to take to the movie theater to surprise my friends with a treat. This is the best caramel corn I have ever tasted and pretty easy to make. Your instructions were clear and easy to follow. Thanks for posting this recipe! --Nancy]]></description>

Glad I did. I&#039;ll be a regular from now on.]]></description>
