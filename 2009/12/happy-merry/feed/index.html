					<description><![CDATA[Anonymous, re: tomato allergies, no problem!  None of our current starters - we have four or five - has tomatoes right now, and we can easily do a pizza for you with no tomato sauce.  Not to worry!  We&#039;d love to have you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so sorry to contact you this way, but, I&#039;ve been reading your blog for two years now, and actually have occasion to visit Seattle for a few days, and would LOVE to come to Delancy for dinner.  Ordinarily, this would not be an issue, but, I come with an allergy to tomatoes...  I&#039;ve read in your sample menu, that you have some alternatives, yet, as it is a sample menu, and I&#039;d like to make reservations, shall I just call and see?  I didn&#039;t want to trouble anyone at a busy time, so thought that this could be the best way to go about it...  sorry if it&#039;s an inconvenience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reading this post reminds me -- I want to buy your book!  I am just about finished with Bob Spitz&#039; &quot;The Saucier&#039;s Apprentice,&quot; and need another book to get started on immediately following. &lt;br /&gt;Of course, I&#039;ve wanted to get your book since I first read about it months ago, but it wasn&#039;t til reading your latest post that I was reminded of that fact -- and just in the nick of time, too, when I am just about out of savory foodie reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just need to say that I ate your cabbage braised in cream... for DESSERT last night!!! I am an infrequent cook, but love Orangette, cookbooks, and memoirs. Asked for your book for Christmas, received it, finished it 2 days later, and have made the cabbage (pgs.186-87) twice already. The bad news is that my husband likes it as much as I do!!! btw... just as good with 1/2 cup cream. Just sayin&#039;--- every calorie/point counts to a WW gal!!]]></description>
