					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just read your article in Bon Appetit and I can&#039;t wait to eat at your place the next time we go to town..(we live on Whidbey).  You make the kind of pizza we like - I grew up on the East Coast and if it isn&#039;t thin crust, count me out!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a genius idea! As a foodie, the sudden desire not to cook is frankly scary... I think my list would involve anything that involved wine in the cooking... that way, I get to drink the rest while I get inspired!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vicky]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly- I just bought your book.  I&#039;m sure you hear it all the time, but thank you.  It&#039;s so honest and charming.  I had to read the passage about &quot;hell hath no furry like a woman starved&quot; to my boyfriend, who burst out laughing because obviously, that&#039;s me perfectly.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My list: chana marsala, roasted califlower, rice and beans, anything involving cilantro, and black bean soup.]]></description>
