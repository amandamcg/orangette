					<description><![CDATA[I just had sauce gribiche for the first time last night on pork medallions. Instead of using the pickles, the chef used extra shallots and it was especially delicious. I can&#039;t wait to make it at home!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just discovered this sauce at Wildwood in Portland, Oregon. The waiter said they use a food processor, and I found the sauce to be really light and almost buttery. No capers but finely chopped cornichons, oil, egg, probably chervil and parsley, and it was divine. Served with beer battered cod and chips... Hope I can duplicate the light creaminess of it. Thanks for the tips!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have loved reading your articles in Bon Appetit and only recently stumbled upon your blog and became a fast fan! I ordered your book after perusing parts of the first chapter and was immediately hooked. Can&#039;t wait until it arrives in the mail. I was hoping you&#039;d be doing book signings in the Los Angeles area sometime soon but was disappointed to find that you didn&#039;t have one scheduled anytime soon. I&#039;d definitely like to hear you speak on food writing and food blogging as an inspiration to foodies and aspiring food bloggers out there who admire your work. So I started a facebook fan page in hopes of getting your blog, book, and name out there as much as possible!! So now all your readers can go to their facebooks and &quot;Like&quot; your fan page :) Hooray!!]]></description>
