					<description><![CDATA[I made this cake two days ago! It was delicious. Nex t time I&#039;m going to try it without the glaze. It was good, but I was imagining a little bit drier texture, and would like to see if that&#039;s what I get without the glaze. Thanks!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OK, I&#039;ve made this cake twice now and it is wonderful!  Don&#039;t be tempted to add spices; the nutmeg is all you need. The only thing I did differently was to first paint the glaze onto the entire cake with a pastry brush and then I drizzled the rest over the top a little at a time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[enjoyed your book- so happy to see the tomato fennel soup recipe- it was dee-lish! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just a question about the sweet potato cake- the texture of mine came out quite moist with a very dense crumb. wondering if that is from the moisture in the sweet potatoes- or maybe I just undercooked it? (but the toothpick was clean!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I almost didn&#039;t comment (what&#039;s one more little comment after 180 others?) but decided that I had to tell you how much I&#039;m enjoying your book. I bought it as a birthday gift for myself, and have another copy on the way for a foody friend&#039;s upcoming birthday. I can&#039;t wait to add it to my cookbook shelf, get batter and berries all over the pages, and write my notes in the margins. So thank you, thank you, and please come to Nova Scotia! You can&#039;t get much better than Digby scallops. And best of luck with Delancy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The pound cake turned out amazing, not to sweet, just like I like it. Didn&#039;t have a bundt cake pan, so made mini muffins and took them to work to share. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is my new favorite potluck dessert. It&#039;s incredibly simple and also incredibly delicious. I use a little bit less sugar (maybe 1/2 cup less, total), double the nutmeg and some extra vanilla in the glaze to thin it out a little. It&#039;s amazing.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Also, your book is fantastic. I bought a copy as a gift, then couldn&#039;t give it away, so I had to buy another copy for my friend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Molly,&lt;/&gt;     I came across your very lovely book because you allowed a Kindle edition. Thanks!  I practice medicine during the day, then grow food and cook and manage my website in the evening, so I probably wouldn&#039;t have found it if it hadn&#039;t been on Kindle. I am so tired of slick, vaguely or grossly cynical &quot;foodie&quot; books that a clear, true voice like yours is a nearly-ecstatic pleasure to encounter. Please, keep writing.]]></description>
