					<description><![CDATA[Molly, your book is lovely!  there are so many places that I can relate to your outlook on life.  I also know about going somewhere just for the food experience.  I have three beautiful daughters, and when they are at school and am lucky enough to have the day off, I always go somewhere just for myself to enjoy some new type of food, or cafe experience. The food, and the way the restaurant/cafe/bistro make me feel keep me coming back!  The food from my childhood, most memorable by the scent that takes me back, is simply cinnamon toast made in the oven. Delightful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah in Ohio]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went to the reading at Ceiba in DC, it was excellent. I got to try the pink cookies (I&#039;m not a fan of cherry flavored anything but I&#039;d make an exception for those darlings) and aunt bill candy. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I am 4/5 done with your book. I had to laugh about your Uncle Art&#039;s technique for shredding butter int pastry dough, I did that the other week and kept patting  myself on the back for my alton brown-esque cleverness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am loving your book, Molly. I wonder if Saint Louis is in the plans at all. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Today I&#039;ll be attempting to place the chocolat fondant cake batter (that utterly gorgeous batter) into ramekins. My husband and I adore the cake but I always plop it somehow during the flibitty-jibbit stage. &lt;/&gt;I will also get a thermometer to see if the problem may be my oven temperature. &lt;/&gt;If you recall an Eden who once made this recipe with whole wheat flour in a far far away place in Turkey, well, that was me. (&#039;Irem&#039; refers to Eden in Turkish.)&lt;/&gt;Enjoy the book signings. Your book makes us connect with you at a personal level just as your blog does. You have somehow balanced the same witty, personal tone with the authoritativeness required in such books. Congratulations.]]></description>
