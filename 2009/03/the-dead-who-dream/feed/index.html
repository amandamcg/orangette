					<description><![CDATA[Oh, have I been where you are: two years ago, my boyfriend and I opened a restaurant in Manchester, NH (Z food &amp; drink; there&#039;s a link to our blog from there where we documented the opening process).&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;At some point, your cashflow will determine your opening date and somehow, magically, you&#039;ll be ready although it will seem impossible right up until you open the doors and seat your first party. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You may not fully remember that opening night or that first week of operation (I don&#039;t), but the exhaustion will subside along with the overwhelm and adrenaline, and you&#039;ll sleep well knowing you answered a BIG question: What if I/we opened a restaurant?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Warm wishes and best of luck to you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So very wonderful to read. And so very real. I can&#039;t imagine the ups and downs frankly. But it&#039;s so cool that it&#039;s all happening. And concrete tabletops. What a concept. I&#039;ve always wanted concrete counters--but tabletops! Holy cow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, all!  Thank you for these comments.  I&#039;m a disaster at keeping up with them, reply-wise, but Brandon and I have read every single one and wanted to be sure to thank you.  You&#039;re fantastic.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Also, to those who asked about / commented on the dog in these photos, yes, he is ours. His name is Jack, and he&#039;s a rat terrier.  He is 5 years old, and we got him through a rescue organization last July.  He&#039;s a handful, but he &lt;&gt;does&lt;&gt; make a handsome model, and we think it all evens out.]]></description>
