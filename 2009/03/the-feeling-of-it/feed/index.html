					<description><![CDATA[Molly, Your book is truly special.  I finished it this afternoon---in awe of your ability to connect with a reader.  Please start planning the next one.  You are a rare woman--and so talented.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter in law is a Casady grad--and told me about you.  I am so grateful to her.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for coming to Omnivore, Kasey!  So nice to meet you.  And since you mentioned that pound cake, I wanted to make sure to point out a typo that sneaked into that recipe in the first printing of the book.  It has to do with the butter measurement, and here&#039;s the lowdown: the amount of butter should be 2 ½ sticks (10 ounces), &lt;&gt;not&lt;&gt; 2 ½ cups. The typo has been corrected in recent printings, so if your book says 2 ½ sticks, you&#039;re fine.  But in case your book is from the first printing, I wanted to be sure to give you a heads-up...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved your book! I can tell that it will take its place beside Laurie Colwin&#039;s books as a cookbook I cannot live without. I found your blog last year sometime and I still remember, salivating, being inspired and making the delicious kale in chicken broth served with a fried egg and good toast. Best of luck. I hope you come to Atlanta sometime - and that I can go, if you do.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Linda]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations on your first book tour (and book!).&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;If you&#039;d like a role model for blogger-book-writing and book-touring, check out the Yarn Harlot, http://www.yarnharlot.ca, a knitting blogger. One of her trademarks is photos of people holding the sock she&#039;s currently knitting -- the more famous/unlikely the person, the better.  She also photographs the crowds who come to hear her, with, of course, The Sock in the foreground of each picture.  She&#039;s worthy of emulating.]]></description>
