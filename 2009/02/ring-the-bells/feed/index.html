					<description><![CDATA[Now I have to write again as I come upon you Maury Island Blog- yi yi yikes- I grew up there and still live on Vashon- I have chickens and now wish I could give you fresh eggs.  I hardly ever hear anyone specifically say Maury-- they always just say Vashon- how kewl is that?  Also another thing; I wish my son could get out to Ballard every day when you open your new Delancy place because he has a lot of experience cooking (now at a Pizza place too)...a lot of serendipity going on as I read your past bogs so I am going to probably end up a pest so I apologize ahead of time but can not promise I can control myself.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Charr&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;PS Sorry if I spelled the name of your new upcoming place wrong but was afraid I would lose this if I go back to check)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, Just made these cookies.  I&#039;m having a hard time NOT eating them.  My girls are all over them and I&#039;ve had to make them stop. I&#039;ve decided to take them to Nashville this weekend and give some to relatives.  I guess it&#039;s the nice thing to do.  Sometimes love hurts, I suppose. I hate departing with them.  Somehow they have to make it through the 2 hour car trip there...hhhmmmm...?!]]></description>
