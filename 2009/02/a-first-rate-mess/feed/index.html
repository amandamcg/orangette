					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry to comment randomly! I came here for asparagus ideas and found that you are an asparagus aficionadao. Much as I love asparagus &lt;&gt;au naturel&lt;&gt;, I was so taken by your asparagus &#039;flan&#039; (really more of a custard, to my way of thinking) that I had to try it. I don&#039;t know whether I did it according to your standards but it certainly earned me some gracious comments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what I really came here to say was that I have placed your RSS feed on my page next to FXCuisine - http://fxcuisine.com/ - (which, if you haven&#039;t already encountered, I really think you should!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here in the UK the best crab probably comes from Cromer, on the Eastern bulge, but I think it is basically the same as your Dungeness crab! It also goes remarkably well with asparagus.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[TLH, I&#039;ve been buying my Polaroid 600 film from &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/149385-USA/Polaroid_625477_600_Instant_Color_Print.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;B&amp;H&lt;&gt;.  It&#039;s expensive, but the price is pretty good, compared to other places online.  And as for Polaroid Spectra film, I&#039;ve stopped buying it.  You can still find it online - do a Google search, or try eBay - but it&#039;s gotten too expensive for me.  Good luck!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Ross, you made day.  Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;This article... brought me up short. It&#039;s the first thing of yours I&#039;ve read, and I feel silly about that. Two years ago I tried to find good food blogs; I asked Google, my friends, everybody, but nobody could suggest any. Yesterday, feeling awesome and cool about my own, fledgeling food blog, I Googled &quot;best food blog.&quot; The NYT Top 50 popped up. &quot;Oh dear,&quot; I thought, &quot;I&#039;m late to the party.&quot; &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Yours is the top of the list; for reasons not worth going in to here, I mistrust top rated things. And then... I read this, and got a little choked up remembering my own leaving home, my own college experience. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You write beautifully. Staggeringly beautifully. I resent the enormous number of vapid recipe blogs; you seem to know what food &lt;&gt;writing&lt;&gt; is all about. Brava! I&#039;m glad I found this.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Best,&lt;/&gt;Ross Donaldson]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m allergic to all seafoods.  I took my special lady to SF once for her birthday, and she sprayed crab juice all in my eye and then kept eating while I tried to stay out of the hospital.  Anyways, nice blog.  Can I ask where you score your poloroid film?  I&#039;m looking for a good source.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks! &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;TLH]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live in Kodiak, Alaska, after many years in Northern California where a December meal of Dungeness crab marked the beginning of the Christmas season. We live-backed them on a redwood fence in the backyard and served them on a tablecloth on the floor accompanied by melted garlic butter, sourdough French bread and salad. I had a friend who made a remarkable tomato crab fennel soup. King crab has nowhere near the refined taste and texture of Dungeness. I am so inspired to make your scallop soup with Alaska scallops!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this may be my first comment here though I&#039;ve been reading a long time :)  I can&#039;t believe how similar our stories are (I also went to Cal for undergrad and am currently here at UW for grad school) and look forward to your book event tomorrow evening!  I love how you&#039;re not afraid to post pictures of the aftermath of a crab eating fest, wee!]]></description>
