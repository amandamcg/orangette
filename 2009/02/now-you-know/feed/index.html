					<description><![CDATA[Just made the soup for the first time. My whole family could not stop paying it compliments as we ate. My kids (boys, ages 10, 8, and 3) adored this. We&#039;ve added it to our regular rotation of favorite dishes. Thanks so much for sharing. It&#039;s the best broccoli soup EVAH!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this soup last night and my husband, who admittedly is already a big fan of broccoli, *loved* it. His new favorite, he called it. I liked it too, especially the dip!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This soup reminds me of one of my mothers that I just returned to--green and soothing, yet far too simple-sounding in composition and technique to warrant much mention. However, her chard-zucchini-cilantro combo is delicious in its bare structure, and probably would only improve with the addition of your lemony sour cream (perhaps with a hit of cayenne).&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;http://www.biggirlssmallkitchen.com/2009/03/cooking-for-one-weekday-detox.html]]></description>
