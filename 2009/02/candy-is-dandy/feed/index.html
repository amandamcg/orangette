					<description><![CDATA[Having spent some time in Nova Scotia(Baddeck!) I had the opportunity to become addicted to oat cakes...lines would form outside the town bakery..anyway thanks to the dailyreason for her recipe..I could hunt one up in one of the local church cookbooks. A note to say how much I am loving your book..I have a running shopping list as I finish each chapter. I think I will take a few weeks and make everything..rats I missed you in DC!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You were aiming for biscuits but ended up with hummus...&lt;/&gt;welcome to my world. It&#039;s why I read your blog, in the attempt to pick up something, anything, about cooking better. &lt;/&gt;Congrats on the book! But no L.A. reading? Porque no?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t worry about those oatcakes.  Many of the Alfords&#039; recipes are....thinking of a polite term...impressionistic.  I&#039;ve had both delicious success and offtrack failures with stuff from Home Baking and Flatbreads and Flavors.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;When I tried the oatcakes they were a bit more coherent than yours, but not really edible in any Earthly sense of the term.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t wish it on you, but it is comforting knowing I am not the only one who can spend hours on something only to be wildly disappointed! And sometimes I assume it&#039;s me, not the recipe, but there are recipes out there that need modification and do not work the way they should. Or the seasoning is too mild or whatever. Sorry you had such a week, but thanks for sharing all the same!]]></description>
