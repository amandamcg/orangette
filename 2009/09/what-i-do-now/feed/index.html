					<description><![CDATA[This recipe is freaking AMAZiNG! I&#039;m now googling the best way to store a crumble because I can&#039;t fit anymore in my belly, the kids won&#039;t eat &quot;fruit&quot; dessert, and my husband is trying to lose a few. If you&#039;re looking through the comments trying to decide if you should make this, don&#039;t think twice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Delicious recipe, even changed up a tad.  I made it tonight with the fruit I had on hand -- a combination of red and black plums, blueberries, blackberries, and a nectarine for good measure. The topping was perfect and plentiful!  Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a recipe for plum ginger crisp I got from Food and Wine years ago.  I&#039;ve tried to track the article down because it had other homey fruit desserts with a twist, but no luck.  I&#039;m so glad I wrote the plum one down.  One thing they used with the fruit mixture which is mysterious and delicious is cardamon, just  a fourth tsp. also fresh ginger, i tsp. No other spices, just the sugar and lemon juice.  In the crumb topping, they add half a cup of sliced almonds, it gives it a great crunch and complements the other flavors beautifully.  I&#039;ve also exchanged the plums with nectarines with great success.&lt;br /&gt;I just started reading you and feel I&#039;ve found the Holy Grail of yum.  I&#039;ve made the butterscotch pots de creme, and to follow up on the religious metaphor (you started) I felt like a classy monk serving my friends such humble, transcendent, holy goodness.  They were so happy.  I&#039;ve made the lima beans and the coconut banana bread, also great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just FYI Molly, I made this back in Sept/Oct with plums. My husband and I agreed we weren&#039;t crazy about the crystallized ginger in it, but we thought the crumble topping was great. So last night I thought I&#039;d try this with apples. I used three large apples sliced medium-thick, cut back on the sugar a bit and omitted the ginger entirely, added a generous squeeze of lemon for tartness, along with about half a cup of fresh cranberries that were languishing in the fridge, and baked about 40 minutes. We loved it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So this isn&#039;t about that plum crumble (though it looks divine).  Or where you&#039;ve been (though you&#039;ve been missed, sorely, even if it is a seriously well-deserved, ahem, &quot;break&quot;).  It&#039;s just a note of thanks for all the years you&#039;ve appeared here, week after week, with wit and warmth and a little something that always, always, always made me snicker.  Not easy on a Monday.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;m as far as I&#039;ve ever been from my Seattle home this Thanksgiving, and was stumped for a fine dinner roll.  And as so often happens, I heard this little voice whispering &quot;Touch of Grace...&quot;, and sure enough, here it still is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#039;t mention it over dinner tomorrow, but Orangette is one of those tiny little lovelies for which I&#039;m awfully thankful.  And happy to wait for.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly]]></description>
