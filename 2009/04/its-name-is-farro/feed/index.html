					<description><![CDATA[I made this recipe yesterday, and it was great! I lived in Syria for a while, and in villages in parts of Syria, mujadara is often made with burghul (aka bulgur wheat) instead of rice. I like your version, since I like the whole grain.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been enjoying this recipe. I tried it as a side with dinner, but my kids aren&#039;t ready for it, so I happily make a batch now and serve it to myself for lunch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one question about preparation that I didn&#039;t see addressed when scanning comments. Since the cooking time is the same for the farro and lentils, is there any reason not to soak the farro, and  save a pan by cooking it with the lentils?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I can imagine is that cooking times might differ by a few minutes, especially if your lentils are of indeterminable age. (I don&#039;t buy mine carbon dated.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I get wild with my next batch, and let the lentils and farro intermingle...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, my goodness!  That sounds amazing.  I&#039;m sure I have some farro in the pantry somewhere, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#039;ve never tried it, a little mascarpone with lentils is positively addictive.  I think a spoonful on top of this would gild the lily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.abreadaday.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You should be proud of yourself. I was attracted with magnetic force to this recipe, but there is no farro to be had in Little Rock. &lt;br /&gt;Instead I decided to become absolutely OBSESSED with mujadara. Seriously, I have eaten it on at least 75 percent of the days that have passed since I found out about it. &lt;br /&gt;Now, thanks to my dad&#039;s visit from Portland, I have farro and can make this version! I am so excited I can barely sit still.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you! I made a similar recipe long long ago, think it was from vegetarian times, and had forgotten. This time I used beluga lentils and what I think was whole wheat grains. I&#039;m stuffed but can&#039;t stop eating it...]]></description>
