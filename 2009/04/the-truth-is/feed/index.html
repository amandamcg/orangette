					<description><![CDATA[Anonymous, don&#039;t worry!  You made the dough correctly.  I don&#039;t know why &lt;i&gt;Bon Appetit&lt;/i&gt; said two envelopes of yeast, because 2 1/4 teaspoons is exactly the amount of yeast in one envelope, and that&#039;s what I called for in the recipe I sent them.  Very frustrating!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for why your dough isn&#039;t rising as fast as it should, I can think of two possibilities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Is the room too cold?  In the winter, my house is usually quite cool, and when I make yeast doughs, they take extra time to rise.  Either give the dough more time, or try moving it to an area that&#039;s a little warmer.  (But not hot.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Is your yeast old, or close to its expiration date?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Help!  I found your recipe for Cinnamon Rolls with Cream Cheese Glaze in Bon Appetit.  I am confused on the yeast.  The recipe calls for 2 1/4 tsp., but then says &quot;from 2 envelopes yeast&quot;.  I made the recipe with 2 1/4 tsp. yeast, but that is only one envelope.  It has been rising for 1 1/2 hours and is certainly not doubling in volume.  Was I supposed to use 2 envelopes of yeast, which would be 5 tsp.???  Oh, The Trouble With Yeast!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Dear Lord, Brandon was right -- this makes a divine sauce for pasta. We had it last night over some sweet potato ravioli and snap peas; I made enough for both of us to take leftovers for lunch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, we ate the entire thing and I&#039;m just dreaming about it...and wondering if I can get away with using the rest of the crema to make the same thing again tonight.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t you know, I just discovered Orangette and now...  Read the first chapter of your book and it is a must read (all on New York Times).  I love the photography on your blog and look forward to reading the blogs and trying the recipes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps it&#039;s something in the air, the overwhelmingness of things to do right now.  Your recipes keep me going (whether I make them or not), and while you&#039;re away we have all the previous material you&#039;ve already so generously put together. I&#039;ll miss you. Have a good summer, and thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like walnut crema, but I think I like this (different but related) sauce even better. It&#039;s courtesy of my (wonderful) mother in law, I think by way of Mollie Katzen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat two cups apple juice. Just before it boils, whisk in 4 T (1/4 cup) miso. Turn off the heat. Blend the miso/apple juice mixture (in a blender or food processor) with two cups of walnuts, 1 T grated ginger, and 1 T (or a little more) rice vinegar. Like walnut crema, the result looks like hummus. My mom in law&#039;s is a tiny bit grainy, which I think is just fine. This is good on asparagus, other veggies, rice, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;ve recently discovered your book and blog, and am enjoying both! Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had to report back that the boyfriend called this &quot;crack&quot; and loved it.  Coincidentally, he returned home with a 3lb bag of walnuts from his family the same day that I made this.  Hurrah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also dipped our roasted new potatoes in it.  I think the salt added to the onions &amp; the boiling water is what makes it work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this a few days ago, and although initially weirded out by the consistency of the crema, it was delicious! I only salted the water and onions and I guess I got lucky, because it tasted just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earthy, savory, lemony, asparagusy goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#039;t get enough.]]></description>
