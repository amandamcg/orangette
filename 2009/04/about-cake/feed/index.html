					<description><![CDATA[I also added sour cream with a bit of milk instead of all milk and I made the cake gluten free, substituting the whole wheat for buckwheat and the regular flour for part oat and part corn starch. it was easy and delicious! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a cake craving at 9pm on a work night and wondered what to do.  And then I remembered viewing this recipe and whipped it up!  Used a hand blender, sour cream instead of milk and used an 8&quot; loaf pan.  The result is wonderful, if a little overbaked at 45 minutes.  I can&#039;t wait to try this again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Know what I love about your blog?  That I can say to myself, &quot;I want snack cake!&quot; at 9pm, on a chilly fall night on the way home from rehearsal, and then immediately think, &quot;Oh, Molly&#039;ll have that.&quot;  And you did!  Half an hour later, my kitchen smells divine.  Thanks for that :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my goodness, Molly! I can&#039;t believe I put off making this for so long, merely because it&#039;s not chocolate and I didn&#039;t have a springform pan. Finally a friend suggested making it in a Bundt pan, and I made Everyday Cake before bed last night. Lightly dusted with powdered sugar, it&#039;s beautiful!! This may be one of the yummiest things I&#039;ve ever made. :) I&#039;m inspired to buy a pretty glass cake dome and make cake a truly &quot;everyday&quot; thing. Thank you, Molly!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Delicious. A little dry, so I might add a tablespoon or two more of butter next time and bake it five minutes less. There will be a next time! I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter, and sprinkled sliced almonds and a bit more cinnamon on top. I&#039;m thinking this will be good with some lightly sweetened yogurt for breakfast!]]></description>
