					<description><![CDATA[Molly , I found myself thinking of you this week as it is my mom&#039;s birthday so here I am trying to foolishly write down these words and hopefully they will find you well . Let me explain. 
Back in 2019 I dmed you on instagram as I was trying to get an early copy of the fixed stars . My mom was slowly dying of cancer back then and being a very loyal reader for years , she were convinced she would not be around to read your book originally planned to be released in may 2020 if i&#039;m not mistaken . So I contacted you and was very surprised to get a message from you and even more,  a signed copy that would travel all the way from the US to my doorstep here in france  . It&#039;s been quite some time . My mom passed away shortly after receiving her copy but she got a chance to read it from cover to cover and even discuss it with me . Earlier this week I was going through some of her belongings and I found the book . I opened it and found a note . I recognised her handwriting . It roughly translates to &quot; I wish you to know that this book was one of the last beautigul things I have encountered by the end of my life &quot;.
I had to let you know . I would want the whole world to know that your act of kindness to a complete stranger will always be associated in my memory to those last few weeks with her . 
Thank you for your generosity . You are a beautiful person , I hope you know it by now]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, 
The Fixed Stars was transcendent. I am going to be teaching it in my workshops, and listing it as one of  my top picks for recommended reading for memoir. I&#039;ve always been a huge Orangette fan (sold my food blog last Nov and am grateful to be done, quite frankly) and a huge Molly W fan. Will always be grateful that you allowed me to share one of your recipes in one of my earlier novels (back in 2009) where kindness was the thing that kept me going. Look how far we&#039;ve come. &#060;3 xxoo]]></description>

Wow that is one rude comment ... 
Molly if you are reading this please know that you are a beautiful person and this community you created here will always stand by you, no matter  what life changes you may face . 
As of you Jamie,  I hope that you take a moment to reconsider what you wrote . Words are powerful and when handled impulsively,  can hurt  . I know for now that you have been hurt  pretty bad yourself. Love my friend is the only answer ..]]></description>

Hi, Jamie! I posted your comment just so everyone could enjoy it. I hope you know that you&#039;re under no obligation to pay for my work, ever. It&#039;s your choice -- and there&#039;s tons of my old writing for free on the Internet, including right here! Thank you for your support while it lasted, and may you find peace.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ugh. Just why? I paid for three of your books. And presumably i put eyeballs on your ada on the site. Why would i pay for this particularly as your last book was  so repellent? Mainly because the first two committed  the audience to a love story that you betrayed suddenly against all your vows. Also if you are suddenly a lesbian sand youbare into the female body fine, the the partner becomes a man, surgically on top and by name and by ambiguous  identity,  what the hell does that mean?  Your poor hisband whonrelocated across the country for your nutty confused whatever you are. Though this will never be posted  because of your stringent  censures.]]></description>

That&#039;s a good question. I still pay for hosting, but it&#039;s expensive! I don&#039;t think I will do it much longer. Let&#039;s say you&#039;ve got another year-ish...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I come back here from time to time to &quot;hear&quot; your voice and/or revisit a favorite recipe. I&#039;ve missed your writing, so I&#039;ll head straight over to sign up for the new newsletter (!).

					<description><![CDATA[I miss reading your posts Molly. Throughout the last -challenging - couple of years in my life  your voice always stood up. Sometimes giving me strength,  other times soothing me and taking care of my wounds . Knowing that you are starting a new writing project is in a way very reassuring.  I will be reading for sure,  you have my word]]></description>
