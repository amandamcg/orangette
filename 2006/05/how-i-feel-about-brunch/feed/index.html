					<description><![CDATA[I agree! I always feel way too full after brunch out.. I always forget that smoked salmon on eggs and hollandaise sauce it too rich..&lt;/&gt;But this is New Zealand proportions, I was totally amazed by the sheer volume of food you get in America. The cheaper the meal the more you get! &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Sarah]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tanvi, those are my sentiments exactly.  I&#039;m a huge proponent of what my family used to call &quot;breakfast-for-dinner.&quot;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kishko, an Italian brunch sounds awfully tempting.  And thanks for the tip, re: Cream Puffs in Venice!  I&#039;ll hop over there right now.  [Oh, and P.S.  I just saw the review of Perche&#039; No on your site!  I &lt;&gt;love&lt;&gt; that place.  Mmm.]&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;bcinfrance, I do seem to recall hearing a lot about &lt;&gt;le brunch&lt;&gt; when I was last over there!  It was all over &lt;&gt;Elle a Table&lt;&gt;, as I remember...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank &lt;&gt;you&lt;&gt;, Megan.  And happy brunch dreaming to you.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Anali, for finding your way over here.  Lovely to meet you!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I hear you, Bea.  How about eggs Florentine for lunch or dinner?  Forget the whole brunch business!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Astillac, I&#039;m SO impressed!  Hot damn!  Way to rise to the challenge!  Those are some pretty pancakes, by the way.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You&#039;re most certainly welcome, Tokyoastrogirl.  And here&#039;s to standing firm against the mountains of pancakes!  Mmmm, mountains of pancakes...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I, too, have felt, too many times, the regret after a hefty brunch.  Although I love a brunch menu more than any other, it is difficult to resist the basket of muffins, side of potatoes and mountains of pancakes that inevitably arrives at the brunch table.  This recipe might actually convince us to stay home as well.  Thanks for the insight.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would dive in for this egg!!! I am like you, I do not know how to feel about brunch, more particularly since I never grew up with it. It is the time that seems wrong to me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I found your blog because I did a search for &quot;brunch&quot; - my favorite meal of the week.  I feel like I just stumbled upon the Holy Grail.  Sorry, Da Vinci Code flashback... Anyway, love your blog. I&#039;m not a big poached egg fan, but I&#039;m going to do some digging for some more recipes here.  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This recipe looks great. I agree that brunch is something I usually end up regretting, although it&#039;s my favorite meal to dream up and plan. There are just so many possibilities! I seem to do better if I stick to eating either sweet or savory and not mix. It&#039;s a tough choice, though! Thanks for the entertaining post. I enjoy your blog.]]></description>
