					<description><![CDATA[Molly you are bloody brilliant as we like to say here in Oz. Have tried so many of your wonderful recipes and have yet to be disappointed. This one knocked everyones socks off. My household only eats fish if it&#039;s fried so imagine my surprise when I was ordered to put this on my regular cooking roster! Thank you and keep up the great work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[fast, easy and impressive!  I just wowed a few people with this quick preparation (which didn&#039;t require me to look at the recipe. - Even more impressive.)  Oh, and I loved it too! Thanks, Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was delicious! We actually used the halibut flaked in fish tacos with cabbage, lime juice, a wee bit of salsa, and avocado sauce (after having a little bit of fish on the side, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poaching liquid is really intriguing - there must be a use for it. It&#039;s almost like a broth... maybe a base for cioppino or the like?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used this poaching technique with catfish the other day, and it was excellent! (The catfish was very fresh from my local fishmonger, and has the advantage of being shockingly cheap...) The addition of the garlic and parsley to the water gives just the right subtle flavor. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great Blog.  Another way to cook fish similar to poaching is the &quot;plate method&quot;.  Simply place a plate with the fish fillet, some flavourings (lemon juice, olive oil, pepper, ginger, coriander, whatever takes you fancy) over a pot of water on the boil. Cover with another plate.  When the top plate is warm hot to touch, the fish is done.  Clean flavours, no mess, no fried fish smell.  What could be easier?!  We don&#039;t have halibut in Australia but ocean trout and salmon work very well.]]></description>
