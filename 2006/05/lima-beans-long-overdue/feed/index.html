					<description><![CDATA[I know I am late to the party on this post, but it got me thinking...there are some things you should never apologize for, and I personally feel garlic breath is one of those things. This is why it is important to fall in love with someone who loves garlic as much as you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We love this recipe. First time we tried it we used fava beans, and in place of the parsley we used cilantro (I almost always try to follow a recipe perfectly the first time, but it seemed a shame not to use all the cilantro in the garden). YUM! I will be using this recipe every Spring from now on (with fava beans and cilantro, we love them so). Thank you!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I fortunately stumbled upon your site after looking for dutch baby pancakes on google. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I am not a fan of lima beans, but I just moved back to my childhood home of Oklahoma City. I will gladly lift a  large chocolate malt from Braum&#039;s in your honor. Shall I also add a cherry limeade from Sonic?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Emmet, you&#039;re most welcome.  I hope that&#039;s a happy memory.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tea, sometimes I think I should just come right out and dedicate Orangette to underdog vegetables!  I seem to keep writing about them...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Marc, I am &lt;&gt;so&lt;&gt; sorry to hear of your migraines!  No cheese, chocolate, or lima beans?  I wonder what the common thread might be.  How interesting - and, I imagine, frustrating.  Harumph!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love lima beans--I just wished they loved me. For some reason, they cause migraines in some people, and I think I may be one of them (I get them from cheese, ice cream, chocolate, coffee, and I believe, lima beans).&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;But they are so good that sometimes I need to take the chance and try them out. Thanks for the recipe! Maybe when I know I&#039;m not doing anything for the next couple of days, I&#039;ll try it.    ;-b&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;-MH&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.hiddenboston.com&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Boston&#039;s Hidden Restaurants&lt;&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Damn.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The person I was supposed to marry cooked lima beans like that.  Before that, I didn&#039;t really consider them edible.  Just reading that, I can taste them, and all the other little pots of vegetables he would keep going on the stove.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Leah, you and Nicolette and your text messages and Holy Grails are too funny.  Thank &lt;&gt;you&lt;&gt;!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;bcinfrance, what&#039;s this about lima beans with maple syrup?  I love lima beans, but I&#039;m not sure how to feel about that!  How is it?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Miz Hatbox, I&#039;m so glad that you - and your husband - approve.  Three cheers for lima beans and their leftovers!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Dee, your lentils - with, mmm, Spanish sausage - sound delicious.  Many thanks for posting the recipe.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Robert Nanders, I&#039;m so sorry to be a tease!  But maybe you can find limas after all - have you tried the frozen section?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kaya, I&#039;m so jealous of you, what with that enormous family garden - even if it did lead you to overdose on limas!  I hope this recipe will  usher in a new era for you and the lowly bean.  And as for Braum&#039;s, I know what you mean.  Many shakes, many scoops...]]></description>
