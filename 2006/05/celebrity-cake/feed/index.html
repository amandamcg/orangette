					<description><![CDATA[molly--&lt;/&gt;I&#039;ve been reading your blog for about amonth and a half now-- religiously!  This is the first story/recipe i read (and salivated over)-- and so every time I returned to your site these pastweeks, , i pulled up this recipe, and promised myself I&#039;d make these cakelets.  It took me a week and 4 grocery stores to find rhubarb and almond meal (which i finally found but was attrociously expensive-- so i made my own with sliced almonds and a food processor)... but I have made them!  and i&#039;m overjoyed by how delicious they are!  thank you for everything orangette is.  you rock!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re welcome, Anne!  I suppose it&#039;s true - sometimes, and sadly, there &lt;&gt;is&lt;&gt; such a thing as too much butter.  These cakes didn&#039;t quite reach that point for me, but if they pushed a little too far for your taste, I think you would be just fine to trim away some of the butter.   Please do report back on the results...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Sarah.  And as for those gossip sites, oh no!  Two more to add to my list?  It&#039;s like a black hole, and I can&#039;t help being drawn in...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, I made up some cakelets last weekend, and really, they were a bit too buttery.  I never thought I would ever say such a thing, but it&#039;s true.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Besides that, though, they were de-li-cious, and I will definitely make them again, though cutting some of the butter out.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks for a great recipe.]]></description>
