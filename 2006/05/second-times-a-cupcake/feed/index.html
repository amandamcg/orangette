					<description><![CDATA[Such a beautiful, tender chocolate cupcake. Like, amazing. It&#039;s funny because most of my family isn&#039;t big on chocolate but I am, so they preferred the frosting and I preferred the cake! Either way, this recipe was a winner in my house! Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love your recipes. Great blog. I found the URL from times. I agree with the idea of having a good chocolate cake with malted frosting.However,when i do not have much time i tend to use bettycrocker&#039;s mixes, since they make it easier for me.I know that is not the best solution but it is not and the worst one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made these after googling - had made the big Nigella version (with some success, maybe my standards are too low?) but wanted something more easily transportable. W_O_W these were wonderful. First time using a complete american cup-measure recipe too. Molly you have a new fan will try more things you recommend - thanks so much for this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I loooooove malt. It&#039;s my childhood favorite food. I use to eat it by the spoonfuls as if it were whipped cream. There could never be enough malt in my glass of milk. And now, this! Chocolate + Malt = Cupcake! Thank you for the recipe!]]></description>
