					<description><![CDATA[i make my own version with slightly less flour.. just mash up a few bananas, add flour, sugar, a little baking powder and a pinch of salt. the end consistency should be... if you drop a spoonful back in the batter it sits there in a splat for awhile... but this way, its final texture is not so cakelike, but a little chewy and soft... hope that works out for you :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[kuih kodok or cekodok (which means toad sweet by the way, alluding to the brown and bumpy form) is one of those concoctions where every mum has her own favourite formula - always by intuition, not measuring spoons! some like it firm and muffin-like, at home we have it like brown pillows oozing with banana dream. some versions include dessicated coconut in the dough, others are served with honey and crushed pistacchio nuts. have fun googling/experimenting :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made a batch of those evil fritters, and as I bit into one, I realised these are almost like the Malay fritters my mum has been making all these years for big family breakfasts! Over here in equatorial Asia, mum&#039;s version is made with mashed ripe bananas and brown sugar, served without powdered sugar... the result is somewhat like banana-cake balls with tanned crispy skin, and very, very addictive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, keiko. You know, I&#039;m not normally a deep-frying type of girl either, but I make an exception - or two or three - for this sort of thing. I hope you will too!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Ah ha, Suzanne, thank you for answering that live (or rather, dead) cultures question. It was a nice thought, yes, but now I&#039;ll console myself with the knowledge that at least the fritters taste awfully good...]]></description>
