					<description><![CDATA[I made this soup for dinner tonight - and lunches tomorrow. It is fantastic! (even though I did accidentally add some black beans instead of beluga lentils - I notice after only adding a few spoonfuls of beans. I was wondering why my lentils were so big...)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been waiting for peppers to come into season so I could try this soup. It was delicious! And even better with a dollop of horseradish cream on top! I think I&#039;ll roast and freeze some red peppers to use throughout the winter, in this soup and others.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s always so funny to me that vegetarians consider their title to be so sacred!  Brian is diluting their lifestyle by eating lentil soup?  That&#039;s hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I just finished eating this soup and it was fantastic.  Thank you for sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally agree with anonymous. This is a cute story--but why would he call himself vegetarian? He&#039;s not. I&#039;m not either. I eat fish, and don&#039;t claim to be veggie--but it really is a lifestyle for those who truly are. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;He should just eat what he wants--everyone makes their own dietary choices, after all--but no calling himself veggie!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tea, you sneaky thing, catching her with her guard down!  Sounds as though you love panade as much as I do, my friend.  We both owe &lt;&gt;The Zuni Cafe Cookbook&lt;&gt; quite a debt of gratitude.  And your mom apparently does too!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Awww, thank you, Zarah!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Jamie, your black bean soup sounds wonderful.  I &lt;&gt;love&lt;&gt; anything involving black beans and cilantro!    My favorite black bean soup / chili recipe is from &lt;&gt;The Greens Cookbook&lt;&gt; - warm and spicy, with a smoky edge from chipotles.  Oh, and as for the nutritional breakdown of lentils vs. black beans, I&#039;m not sure, but I imagine that they must be quite similar, since they are both legumes.  Pretty healthful stuff, either one!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Glad to hear it, Fiber!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tanna, I think you&#039;ll love this.  Please let me know how it turns out...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Carol, you&#039;re very welcome!  I&#039;m so glad that you approve.  And as for that duck stock?  Amen.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Well said, Jason.  I very much admire your outlook.  Your &quot;Oh, I can ignore that&quot; is very similar to Brandon&#039;s approach, and certainly you both share a love for food - and the people you share it with - that transcends rigid rules and boundaries.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nerissa, it amazes me sometimes how radically palates can differ!  I have a feeling, though, that if you&#039;re very patient and loving - and maybe a little sneaky - you can convince your man that some of those items that he doesn&#039;t think he likes are actually quite tasty...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Anonymous - not only for the congratulations, but for that very sweet story!  A longtime vegetarian marrying a former butcher, and eating steak, to boot - I love it.  You two sound wonderful together.  Cheers to both of you, and to your compromises in the kitchen!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Ooooh, David!  I hadn&#039;t thought of that.  Hot damn.  I wonder how a picnic rehearsal dinner might work, with Baguette Box catering?  &lt;&gt;Miam, miam&lt;&gt;...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Long live the Baguette Box...and French Fries are certainly the great equalizer since no matter what your &#039;ism&#039;, there ain&#039;t no one that can&#039;t (or won&#039;t) eat potatoes, especially when they&#039;re as good as those.&lt;/&gt; &lt;/&gt;And if I were you, Molly, I&#039;d give them a call right now and make sure they&#039;re available for catering your big day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[long-time lurker here.  I&#039;ve been meaning to write you to tell you that every recipe I&#039;ve attempted from this website has been fabulous, and I&#039;ve enjoyed your writings very much.  so, thanks!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;however. the reason I&#039;m writing today is to 1) say congratulations on the engagement, 2) to let you know that I was a vegetarian for 16 years before I  fell in love with my  now-husband. who is a former butcher. (yes, really.)&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;and one day, after living together about a month, he came home, looked me deep in the eyes, and said, &quot;Sweetheart, I&#039;m grilling two steaks tomorrow night for dinner.  Be prepared.&quot;  and so it was.  (and, yes, the steaks were really delicious.  and no, I didn&#039;t get sick.)  I&#039;m still not a huge meat eater-- I eat red meat maybe once per month-- and my husband knows that if he needs to eat meat more than that, he has to cook it.  but I&#039;m learning, slowly.  (and last night I cooked fish for the first time, solo (salmon fillet, covered with a puree of garlic, parsley, lemon zest, capers and olive oil)--and it was good.)&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;congratulations again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh dear... I wish it was that easy to deal with my beloved.
