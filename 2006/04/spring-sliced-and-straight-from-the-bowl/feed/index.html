					<description><![CDATA[Keeping the thread alive!  After many iterations of this salad, may I recommend people try it with lentils or farro; toasted pumpkin seeds or pistachios; pink or red grapefruit; and/or rye croutons. It&#039;s the grapefruit, though, that really sends it over the moon. A real table-pounder. Thanks, Molly! - chloe]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So many years after the post... I just wanted to let you know that I have been making this salad every week since February. Now it&#039;s June and there is no end to my devotion in sight. It&#039;s pretty much always the same. Sometimes I add a poached egg, sometimes I substitute shaved parmesan. It never ever ever gets old. Thank you thank you thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tried this last night for a dinner party! I was so impressed by all of the interesting flavors. I have to admit, I was a little hesitant at first, but I am glad that I tried it. I posted a version of the salad on my blog, I hope you don&#039;t mind:) Thanks for a great recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had to pipe in again.  I&#039;m obsessed.  So many beautiful radishes available at market, and such delicious local feta, it&#039;s become my go to salad.  Although my incarnation of this salad subs out the endive and radiccio (which we don&#039;t have at our local farmers&#039; market) for butter lettuce and arugula.  Also, if on hand, slice a little prociutto in the bowl...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have, of late, become enamored with this salad. Good stuff. I already liked endive, but you are turning me into a lover of radishes. (and you have turned my 6-year-old into a lover of lima beans, which is an impressive feat indeed!)]]></description>
