					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know Brandon from Oberlin and have been following the Delancey progress via Twitter... SO amazing! I read your blog several years ago, stopped reading blogs for awhile, and for some reason didn&#039;t come across it again when I started using Google Reader, but I&#039;m so happy I stumbled upon it again and will now be a loyal reader! I had to search your archives for the Brandon story and am so glad I did. You sound just as wonderful as he is. :-)  Best of luck with the restaurant opening, and I hope to meet you there sometime I&#039;m on the west coast!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendy]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello! Congrats (-:&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m a journalist and am thinking about writing an article about pursuing a passion online and finding love along the way.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;As I&#039;m doing my research, I&#039;m running across a large number of sites about how to find love online. Here&#039;s a funny one:&lt;/&gt;http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/how-dont-i-love-thee/&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;ve found success stories:&lt;/&gt;http://love.ivillage.com/snd/meetmarket/0,,q8lf,00.html&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;However, I&#039;m not finding a lot of interesting stories about fun, creative people who found love via blogs or other other online pursuits. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;ve found a couple who found life in second life/myspace:&lt;/&gt;http://news.myspace.com/gaming/secondlife/item/2782958&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;An online dating podcaster who found a fun love online:&lt;/&gt;http://nantekoto.libsyn.com/ &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And, I found your site. Would you be open to an interview if I do finally write my article?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Susan]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know this is an older post so I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ll ever even read this comment but I just had to say that my husband and I have such a similar story.  Only he was in Seattle and I was in New York and we got engaged 10 days before you two did.  I was working in Brooklyn when I was in New York right next to the promenade.  Now we&#039;re married and living in Seattle.  Congratulations to you and Brandon!]]></description>
