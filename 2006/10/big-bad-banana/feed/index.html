					<description><![CDATA[Want to make a banana cake this week, but can&#039;t decide which one. I know I want to do a chocolate frosting, but what&#039;s the difference between the cake in this recipe and the one with the ganache glaze? Which one do you like better?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made this cake last night and it is fabulous. The icing is wonderfully fluffy and glossy. My only change was to toast the coconut before sprinkling it on top. This cake is an absolutely keeper!]]></description>
