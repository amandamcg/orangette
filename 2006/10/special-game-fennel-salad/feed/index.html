					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, I guess it´s time I left my thanks. I´ve been making this for years now, I love it, my friends love it. In fact I´m on to my second mandolin now. So THANK YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debjani.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. I add lemon zest and truffle oil to the dressing]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;This is one of your posts that I read when it originally appeared. I didn&#039;t make it at the time, but the idea stuck in my head. Really stuck... for three years. It&#039;s one of those recipes that my little brain couldn&#039;t make sense of. I think it&#039;s the rawness of the whole thing. I love shaved fennel, yes, and sliced mushrooms. But... It just didn&#039;t sound cohesive. Too much sharpness. Too cold. I don&#039;t know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you, Molly, have a perfect knack for curating recipes, so I have this trust in your suggestions. And FINALLY, this week, I made this salad exactly as you described. Not just once, but three times in a single week. I&#039;m in love. I wouldn&#039;t change a thing. And it just doesn&#039;t surprise me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After being prompted by your version of this in the book, I finally purchased fennel for the first time ever!  I loved the freshness (lemon!) and saltiness and crispiness of this salad.  I must confess it was only one extra-large serving for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I wanted to confirm for anyone else wondering - a nice ripe Bartlett pear worked well, too, if Asian pears are not available.]]></description>
