					<description><![CDATA[Well, I&#039;ve made this, following your instructions and also Smitten Kitchen post.  It came out fabulous!  I also added strawberries in the center and cooked them in the caramel sauce, too.  Strawberry and apple flavors infused with caramel - it was such a delicious dessert!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made this, and like all of your recipes, it came out wonderfully :) I only needed three apples instead of 5 :) (maybe my skillet is a bit smaller). I will do a post on it soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Molly. I wanted to let you know about the exciting cake I made for my friend&#039;s birthday last night- it seems like the kind of thing you&#039;d be interested in knowing about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on your recipe I made her a tarte tatin cake- I cooked up the apples just as you would for a tarte tatin but instead of then adding pastry and putting in the oven I transferred them to the bottom of a lined cake tin. I then added the batter for a basic Victoria sponge cake and cooked up another sponge cake too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept hold of the precious cooking liqueur left over from the bubbling apples and bubbled up another batch of apples while those cakes cooked. I let the second batch of apples cook so they were almost falling apart and completely saturated with the delicious buttery caramel- which I then took out of their caramel and blended to a tarte tatin puree. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then combined the leftover appley caramels and let them bubble away for quite a while until they were quite thick and sticky- to which I added about 100ml of double cream to make a butterscotch sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the cakes had cooled I sandwiched them together with the blitzed appley goo and copious amounts of the delicious appley butterscotch sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it was good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best,&lt;br /&gt;Amy xxx]]></description>

<p>I then combined the leftover appley caramels and let them bubble away for quite a while until they were quite thick and sticky- to which I added about 100ml of double cream to make a butterscotch sauce.</p>
<p>Once the cakes had cooled I sandwiched them together with the blitzed appley goo and copious amounts of the delicious appley butterscotch sauce.</p>
<p>And it was good. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, just wanted to let you know that I&#039;ve made this tart twice in the last week (and once long ago) and it&#039;s now my favorite desert. I added a quarter cup of Pommeau de Normandie (blend of apple must and apple eau-de-vie) to the butter and sugar mixture, which adds an extra layer of flavor. But otherwise left everything the same. Love this recipe! Thank you!:)]]></description>
