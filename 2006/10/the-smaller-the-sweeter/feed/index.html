					<description><![CDATA[So nice to &quot;meet&quot; you, Hadley. And I absolutely know what you mean about torturing yourself with Craigslist Paris.  I&#039;ve done that more than I would like to admit!  As for the link, it must have changed since I first posted it, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ciep.fr/en/assistantetr/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; should work.  I&#039;ll correct it above, too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! I just found your blog about a week ago, thanks to my librarian mother who discovered your book and then passed this delicious secret on to me. I love it, I just graduated from college, and this makes me feel like maybe I will be able to construct the life that I really want, which is I think similar to yours. I spent a semester in France during college and now I look at apartment listings on the Paris Craig&#039;s list and torture myself way too often. I really wanted to look at the site you posted about what you did in Paris, but the link says that the page is unfindable (direct translation). Do you know if there is somewhere else I could find it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, this was delicious, with a small organic cauliflower and a loaf of rosemary bread and slices of white cheddar on the side. I&#039;ve been scared of cauliflower for years, but this was so tender and sweet and tangy I will be making it again and again this winter. Thank you!]]></description>
