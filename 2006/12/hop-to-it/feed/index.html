					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, Although this recipe has been posted a while ago, I found it the other day and hoped that it could break my cookie-spell. I love to cook and am not the worst baker in the world I wasn&#039;t able to bake cookies. They always came out wrong. Until your recipe!! they finally came out like they should. It really made my easter weekend perfect. So thanks for the recipe. i&#039;ll be reblogging it on my tumblr! thanks again, love your blog and congratulations on the baby!&lt;br /&gt;love Marijn (the Netherlands)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mmm, just made these, with lemons since Meyer lemons aren&#039;t available right now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something French (ish) to bring to my book group tonight. Our featured book is The Elegance of the Hedgehog by Muriel Barbery and, just as the book had me feeling like I&#039;d been transported to Paris, these fit the bill perfectly. Hopefully they will not be gone before I have to leave tonight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I made it to Seattle this summer for the first time in 3 years (my husband is from there). Eating at Delancey was at the top of our to-do list but alas you were closed the very four days we were there. Heartbreaking!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A series of links from one of my fellow garden bloggers brought me here and oh, my, Molly! What a great site you have!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m sitting in the breakfast room looking at a Meyer lemon hanging ready on our small container tree and now have big plans for it. &lt;/&gt;Thank you for the recipe. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Seattle is one of my favorite cities - prettier in summer - but we also enjoyed our 5 gray &amp; rainy visits in November.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Annie at the Transplantable Rose]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My sister Laurie Amster-Burton sent me this link when I mentioned I was going to a cookie exchange.  Even though I live in a Meyer-lemon capital (Sacramento), I decided to use clementines (because I had them; our CSA will be sending Meyer lemons by the bagful soon, so it seemed silly to buy any) and they turned out wonderfully.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I froze the dough for a couple of hours, instead of refrigerating, and found I liked slicing them when they were still more frozen, rather than in the later somewhat-softer state that more resembled how they would have come out of the refrigerator.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[MMmm. As soon as I spotted the Meyer Lemons in the market, I knew what I was making.  Now I&#039;m patiently waiting for my bottle of Sauternes to chill.  Since reading your post I can&#039;t help thinking that would be such a nice accompaniment to the ultra buttery cookie. &lt;/&gt;Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good question, Anonymous!  You know, I can&#039;t really remember how many of these I put in each tin last year.  I want to say six, maybe?  One batch was enough for 10 or 12 tins with leftovers to spare.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I&#039;ve been squirreling away cookie recipes for months, waiting for winter break to arrive so I can make them and give them away.  And do lots of quality control checks.  Perhaps I shouldn&#039;t have waited so long, because now I have 13 dozen cookies to bake.  These look fantastic!  But how many silver-dollar sized cookies do you usually give to each person?]]></description>
