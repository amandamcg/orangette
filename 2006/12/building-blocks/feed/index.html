					<description><![CDATA[Gosh I&#039;m late to the party! Just made these with dark chocolate, dried apricot paste (chopped up), dried cranberries, toasted cashews, and toasted walnuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#039;m thinking of a rocky road version with marshmallow and pecans. My question is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you think chopped-up petit beurre biscuits would stand up to this treatment?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these in mini muffin cups as I couldn&#039;t cut nice, neat squares with my first batch. It was much easier and cuter. I reserved some of the fruit &amp; nuts and sprinkled it on top before chilling. (Ina Garten does this with chocolate bark in her new book). I used candied ginger, salted peanuts, almonds, dried cherries, golden raisins and fleur de sel. Absolutely adorable &amp; delicious - thanks for the inspiration.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My gosh, these are so very, very good. I made them for gifting this year and used just salted peanuts and cranberries. Can&#039;t stay out of them. Thank you!]]></description>
