					<description><![CDATA[I made these a lot when I was living in France in 2010/2011 from your recipe. It&#039;s been a long time since then, but I was listening Spilled Milk episodes not too long ago and there is one where you mention you can do the same thing with cabbage, so I did that tonight. Alongside a poached egg, baked tomatoes with fresh garlic, and toast. Delicious. Just wanted to let you know, this recipe is still making people happy :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to say thank you for this recipe. I hated Brussels sprouts all my life, but back a few  years when they became rather trendy, I decided to give them a shot. I used your recipe, and it blew the top of my head off.
I&#039;ve served this recipe at every Thanksgiving since, around 8 years or so, and I&#039;m amused to say I&#039;ve recruited several sprouts-haters since then. Thank you for this genius recipe. Simple, elegant, and devastatingly delicious.]]></description>
