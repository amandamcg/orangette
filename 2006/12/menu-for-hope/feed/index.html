					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for your advice! It&#039;s a tricky business to figure those things out - guess I&#039;ll just have to try it again. Until then, I&#039;ll blame the coconut!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eva, I just wrote you a wildly long-winded reply over at your blog - whew!  I am &lt;&gt;verbose&lt;&gt;, lady.  My inclination is that maybe the coconut - or, more precisely, the stuff that sells as sweetened shredded coconut - is different in Australia from what I buy here in the States.  Assuming all measurements are correct, I have generally found that this macaroon recipe is pretty flexible, so I&#039;m not sure what else to guess.  I hope this helps at least a little...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;/&gt;I tried to reproduce your macaroons and I failed... I have to admit that I didn&#039;t follow your recipe to the letter: I stopped the cooking process earlier (stuff seemed to get dry) and I didn&#039;t have enough space in the fridge (I let them rest at room temperature), and I made them bite-sized. You can see the result here:&lt;/&gt;http://sweet-sins.blogspot.com/2006/12/baking-christmas-cookies-part-ii.html&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;What do you think what was the major mistake? Your feedback would be much appreciated!&lt;/&gt;EVA]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Lisa, that makes me so happy!  Awww!  I love the thought of you living on a vegetable farm, and those Tuesday night potlucks!  And that braised cabbage with garlic - hot damn, girlfriend.  I&#039;ll have to try that.  In the meantime, please keep me posted on your assorted adventures and oopses and raptures.  It&#039;s always a treat to hear from you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, Molly!  Another wonderful tale of these macaroons (I wrote you last year when I made them, asking about making small ones):&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;d gotten off to a spazzy start with the macaroons on Saturday, hoping to take them to a cookie potluck (really: not a good idea to look for a plane ticket via dial-up while you warm your cream, particularly when there&#039;s no time to drive into town for more AND you&#039;ve forgotten to work the chilling time into your schedule AND&lt;/&gt;OHJESUSTHEPARTYSTARTSINTWOHOURSIHAVETOLEAVE!!!).  But it was all for the best, really.  My oopses meant I found a super-fast and rockin&#039; recipe for butter drop cookies w/ chocolate in Mark Bittman&#039;s How to Cook Everything, and thus arrived at the party without empty hands.  I do love me that Minimalist.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And, Tuesday mornings are the dairy delivery at a little natural grocer I just discovered, and I could get better cream that way, and myohmy!  So I redid the ganache yesterday instead, to feed some hungry farmers.  I live on a vegetable farm now (Yes, yes! Oh, the tales I could tell of the tomatoes, and the greens, and the bartering with other farmers at market for pork and raw milk and bread), and every Tuesday evening we have a potluck with neighboring farm workers and young farmers -- a super thing, as things are a bit quieter here, socially and otherwise, than they were in NYC.  The macaroons were a delightfully received end to a happy, happy feast.  The entire meal was a spectacular and relaxed success (farmers are capable of nothing less, especially once the season is done).  I braised some of my farmer man&#039;s cabbage as well, per your suggestion, with a gaggle of garlic cloves tossed in, in lieu of carrots.  The cabbage has become densely sweet in this cold weather!  I didn&#039;t know it was possible to make that recipe more yummy, but the frosts and the picking it ourselves do do it proud.  While I really don&#039;t like being the center of attention ... well, the cabbage and the cookies both met many loud moans of rapture.  Look what you can do!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks :)&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;peace&lt;/&gt;Lisa]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, don&#039;t worry, Tony - I&#039;ll only be making a dozen.  One batch, and one batch only, for the lucky raffle winner!  But should you come to the States one of these days, I&#039;ll bet I could be convinced to make some more...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Lobstersquad, I&#039;m so sorry!  I wish international express mail were a little bit cheaper...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Pim has had a really a lovely idea! Also a good time of year to remember those who go without, day after day after day.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You will be making a HUGE number of macaroons! Could you set some aside for my next trip to the US?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;happy macarooning&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tony]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, thank &lt;&gt;you&lt;&gt;, Sam.  It&#039;s my pleasure.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m so glad you like my little macaroon offering, Shuna!  I sat back and weighed all the options, and this felt most in keeping with my plans for a handmade-only holiday.  It&#039;s modest, but it also really feels like me.  Macaroons it is!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Janet.  I hope you&#039;ll make a donation!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I hear you, Julie!  I don&#039;t know what it is about these, but Brandon goes crazy for them.  When we were first dating - if you can call it that, since we lived on opposite coasts - I sent him a batch of these in a care package.  He shared them with some friends, one of whom told Brandon shortly thereafter that he should marry me.  I guess I owe it all to the macaroons, huh?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nice to meet you, K!  And yes, Brandon is indeed an &quot;Obie&quot; - or, more specifically, a &quot;Connie.&quot; [He let me in on the lingo.  I feel so cool!] He&#039;s very loyal to the place - so much so that I feel kind of sad, actually, that I went to Stanford.  Gah.  Maybe we&#039;ll head back to Ohio one day, so I can see his old stomping grounds...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Brett, have you bought your raffle ticket yet?  Hmm?  I hope so!]]></description>
