					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I just want you to know that even though this post is old, it still warms my heart as I keep coming back to read it over occasionally. This post is the reason I started baking. And even though my muffins did not turn out as delicious tasting/ looking, probably due to using a 20 year old oven (something like this: http://bajajvacco.com/images/small/oven01.jpg), I have tried to grow my baking skills from here. I&#039;m still figuring out better ways to use the oven.
In the meantime, I&#039;ll try to live this day of yours in a daydream.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Katy, if you would like to trade your sunny Argentinian weather for some of Seattle&#039;s wet stuff, I would be more than happy to arrange it! In the meantime, I hope you enjoy the cakes, rain or no.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, keiko. Today was a gray, gloomy, drippy Saturday, so I took your advice and stayed warm on the couch and in the kitchen, making an enormous pot of soup and a batch of &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.kqed.org/weblog/food/2006/01/shunas-famous-gingerbread.jsp&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Shuna&#039;s famous gingerbread&lt;&gt;. And you know, I might not mind a Sunday of the same...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Fellow Seattlite theWebSorceressCooks, you&#039;ve got the right idea.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Emmeya, I&#039;m honored! I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever had my own programmed key - and on a &quot;fauncy&quot; keyboard, to boot!  [Excellent adjective.] Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The cake looks delicious.  I agree with you about the rain and gray skies.  This is my third winter in Seattle and I would give anything to have sunny days again, which is saying a lot from a fellow fair-skin redhead.  I love Seattle though!  Gray skies are just a reason to cook and bake some good food.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Molly, I don&#039;t think I&#039;d survive without seeing sun for 25 days... (even though I love your gorgeous picture of  the rainy window) I think Zarah is right, I know you don&#039;t need an excuse for baking delicious cakes, but bake/cook &#039;even more&#039; and let us share your beautiful creations. Keep warm, keiko]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;&gt;Goooodness!&lt;&gt; I leave town for three days, and a deluge of comments comes rolling in!  So glad to see I&#039;m not the only one who prefers cake over rain.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Zarah, this probably won&#039;t surprise you, but I&#039;m &lt;&gt;full&lt;&gt; of excuses for cake - both baking it and eating it! Speaking of which, the sun has been shining for a good hour or so this afternoon, and I&#039;m thinking a celebratory sweet may be in order...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;ACB, I sympathize with your kitchen woes!  When I lived in Paris, the kitchen of my tiny studio apartment was literally built into the hallway between the bathroom and the main room.  I had a two-burner stove and a small fridge beneath it, and a sink with cabinets mounted on the wall above and below.  No counter space at all!  I quickly cleared off the top of the nearby dresser / shelves and started using that as an auxiliary kitchen, a place to chop, to sit a toaster, to keep fruit for ripening, etc.  When in doubt, recruit other furniture!  When Brandon and I are cooking in his apartment, we wind up doing a lot of prep work on the dining room table.  It isn&#039;t a great height for chopping, but it works.  Also, when I was in Paris, I ran out and bought a couple of medium-grade knives, some big wooden spoons, a grater, and some decent salt, oil, and vinegar.  There&#039;s nothing worse than not being able to properly cut up ingredients - except having them taste underseasoned!  So if you can, pick up a few essential tools and seasonings.  Try one of the restaurant supply stores in Chinatown, the upstairs of Zabar&#039;s, or even TJ Maxx for decently priced knives.  When (or if?) you leave NYC, you can pack them in a homemade cardboard sheath and put them in your checked luggage.  Hit Fairway or Trader Joe&#039;s for a great selection of reasonably priced oils, vinegars, salts, and spices.  And then, my dear, do what you can.  Go forth, and be brave.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;TheBon, I&#039;m sorry to hear that the rain has stretched far enough south to hit Eugene too!  On the upside, it &lt;&gt;is&lt;&gt; nice and green here, so I assume the foliage is thriving prettily down by you too...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Ivonne, thank you!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tana, it has almost come to that, I assure you.  If it weren&#039;t for my sweet tooth, I&#039;d be long gone.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Clare, &quot;crazy&quot; is definitely an appropriate word.  It also accurately describes how I feel about the sun these days!  And as for these cakes, yes, they are similar to friands, only a bit bigger...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Michele, thank you for your sympathies, cherie!  I assure you, my hair has been suffering.  But at least my tastebuds are doing well, right?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nic, thank you for your generous weather offer!  I am happy to report that - as of this very moment - the sun is shining!  I actually saw a man wearing &lt;&gt;sunglasses&lt;&gt; a minute ago.  If this keeps up, I&#039;m going to start thinking I&#039;m in southern California...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Shauna, I know.  I struggled a bit in writing this, actually, not wanting to contribute to the hackneyed old &quot;Rainy City&quot; stereotype.  But yes, this year, Seattle is living up to the old cliche.  Better not tell anyone, though, how gorgeous the summers are.  Shhhh!  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Foodiechickie, you&#039;re right.  It does &quot;squirt&quot;! Good description.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Luisa, my dear, I&#039;m so glad to know we&#039;ve been saving the same clippings. You&#039;re a woman of taste!    I&#039;ll tell you what: I&#039;ll trade you almond cakes for home-cured bacon.  What do you say?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Sher, thank you.  Glad your rainy days are over, and here&#039;s hoping ours are too - or will be soon!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Brian, I wish I could send a little (or a lot) of our rain down to you.  I hope you and yours haven&#039;t been in any of the areas affected by grass fires - very scary, very sad.  I&#039;d be lying, though, if I said I weren&#039;t jealous of your tropical temperatures.  Grrr.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Briana, I dare say that you have chosen the right chocolate cake for a birthday!  I hope you found the recipe as delicious as I do.  Many thanks for your generous compliments!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hag, I hope that Vancouver is getting a bit of the sun that Seattle is seeing this afternoon!  And if not, hope the cakes are helping...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Becca, thank you!  And three cheers, of course, for cake.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anonymous, thank you for the book suggestion.  I&#039;ve never heard of &lt;&gt;Pastries&lt;&gt;, but I&#039;ll be sure to look into it...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Raina, you&#039;re very welcome!  Your quiche, cake, and coffee sound like my kind of pick-me-up.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Jeanne, I hope you found them as tasty as I do...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Aww, Melissa, thank you!  I should have known you&#039;d be a &lt;&gt;financier&lt;&gt; fan, you wise woman, you.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tania, thank you!  If nothing else, rain is at least good for occasional inspiration...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;From our kitchen, my thoughts exactly.  May your 2006 bring much cake!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think all that rain is the &lt;&gt;perfect&lt;&gt; excuse to bake lots of goodies! Not that I usually need excuses, but never mind. This take on financiers - one of my favorite French confections, by the way - is brilliant. I can just imagine how beautifully the sweet acidity of the grape compliments all that buttery, almondy goodness. Brava!]]></description>
