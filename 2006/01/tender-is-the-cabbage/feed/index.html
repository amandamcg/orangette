					<description><![CDATA[I found this recipe about 3 years ago. Cooked it, again and again and again and now, tonight.  Occasionally I add potatoes &amp; serve with some type of grilled meat.  It is a never-fail delicious dish.  Thank you and I do so enjoy your blog.  Wonderful writing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Whoa! It has been many years since you posted this recipe, but it is still making waves, Molly. I just ate my portion...and am having trouble not eating the other 5 all by myself. YUM. I hoped it would be worth the two hours...it was. If you are still checking posts, do you have any suggestions for leftover, besides just reheating and eating the exact same way, which couldn&#039;t be bad?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Though it&#039;s not the season for this sort of dish, I had half a head of cabbage leftover from something else this week, and this felt like the perfect, comforting way to make it. Thanks so much for the recipe!]]></description>
