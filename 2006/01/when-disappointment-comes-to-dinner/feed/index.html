					<description><![CDATA[Just made these today. I could not believe how liquidy the batter was and didn&#039;t think it a million years they would work out as cookies, but they did. I put them on for 14 minutes but might do 15 or 16 next time, just to go a tad crispier. They wouldn&#039;t be better, just different - the chewy version was fine.

And yes, even once they cool you have to kind of jimmy them off the parchment paper, but it&#039;s nothing major.

I used 4 squares of a Lindt 85% cacao bar instead of the nibs, because that&#039;s what I had. Success!

I so wish there was a way to use less sugar. They didn&#039;t taste horribly sweet, but I&#039;ve been really trying to reduce my sugar so would love to figure out a hack. Will report back if I figure something out.

I might also experiment with hazelnuts, just because I love them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made these, and im trying not to be too sad that I seemed to have messed them up. They still taste delicious. But the tops of mine started to crackle early--after about 12 min. Thinking it would be better to err on the side of less cooked, I took them out. They stuck to the parchment paper, and even though they were cool, they were falling apart. I have been thinking about these cookies for so long, and wanted then to be crisp and chewy and perfect! :( please encourage me to try again folks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The best cookie recipe ever! Simple, ultra-delicious and a tiny bit healthier than your average cookie. What&#039;s not to like? I didn&#039;t have nibs so I used extra walnuts. I am going to try not to eat all of them before I get a chance to share them with friends. I think they&#039;re going to crown me Cookie Queen :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just finished baking these, the aroma is awesome and they look great, can&#039;t wait to eat them. But...the batter was not thin and they did not spread at all. Not a problem, I ended up with about 20 cookies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i made these last night and they came out perfect! as someone who has terrible luck with baking but will never give up, i was so proud and pleased. the only thing that went wrong, and it seems lots of people had this problem, was that they stuck to the parchment, each and every time. maybe next time i will put some butter on it? not sure if that will work but it&#039;s worth a shot on at least one round. thanks for posting!]]></description>
