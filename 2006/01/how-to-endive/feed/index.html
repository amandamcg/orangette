and crusty baguette and a bright salad, followed by more baguette and camembert, and then pain d&#039;Ã©pices spread with cream cheese frosting--an Americans&#039; dinner in France. Thank you, it was lovely.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm. There are times when I think things just happen for a reason. This is a fine example. I found your blog quite by accident when looking for general food sites on the web. I was trying to find something to make with some prosciutto I had that was getting old. Thing is went to your site not because of the prosciutto on the recipe, but because I saw that you had won the best food blog award. This endive post was the first one I read. It sounded so wonderful that I had to make it right away. I left work early and headed straight to the store. All I can say is wow! This is a sublime dish. The soft somewhat sticky, salty prosciutto transforms into lightly chewy deeply flavored bits that blended so well with the soft rich endive that it was a match made in heaven. You hooked me with one post and recipe. I have joined your legion of foodie readers and may never leave. ;-) Thanks for sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pille, it&#039;s high time that your plate saw some endive!  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;MEM, your &quot;pork emulation&quot; ideas are ingenious!  Especially that gouda suggestion - maybe a 4- or 5-year gouda, good and caramelly?  Or that pimenton de la Vera?  Definitely worth a go, preferably soon.  And Brandon will swoon, I&#039;m certain, over the truffle oil idea.  He&#039;s a fiend for the stuff, and rightfully so.  Thank you!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Lisa, my dear, all birthday confusion aside, if you ever feel like sharing that punch recipe (or formula, or rough sketch), you know how to find me.  But in the meantime, are you leaving New York &lt;&gt;for good&lt;&gt;?  Hmph. I don&#039;t like the sound of this...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Anne!  I would certainly urge you to try this recipe, even on your endive-phobic husband.  Endive&#039;s strident bitterness softens quite miraculously with braising, pork, and cream.  And about this bechamel rendition: how could I have never tasted this?  The &lt;&gt;shame&lt;&gt;!  It sounds divine...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I met with endives in France, beforethat I didn&#039;t know that lettuce came in different sizes, let alone different shapes and colors!   Since my French husband has a tough time eating cooked endive because he found them bitter as a child, I have trouble cooking them.  But living and cooking in France, and with them being in season, it&#039;s tough to avoid them!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;This recipe, just might change my mind.  It looks so tasty. (Can I do that too?)&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The only way I&#039;ve done them cooked is the classic: endives with bÃ©chamel sauce.  Un classique, n&#039;est-ce pas?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Great veggie entry!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, no, that punch was many many moons ago (some 84 of them or so?) -- but delicious enough to still get talked about, and made over and over again in various &quot;I think it had a little bit of this&quot; renditions.  I did have a different birthday last month -- I don&#039;t celebrate them quietly, and am always happy for an excuse to cram loads of people into a small New York living room for brunch!  I&#039;m going to see if I can&#039;t entice folks again (for brunch, I mean) before I leave New York next month.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;But anyhow, these days, it&#039;s All About You!  I&#039;m going to be quite far from my kitchen for a while, when I leave New York -- (pauses to clutch her collar and catch her breath) -- so I will depend on you even more for my vicarious culinary delights.  But no pressure!  Orangette is just such a dependable-but-always-new joy, like settling into your favorite pair of old pajamas with a glass of big spicy red wine and a thick juicy book you&#039;ve never heard of, given as a gift by a friend whose taste never falters.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;What I&#039;m saying is thank you.  I love reading Orangette and will stick around as long as you do.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;peace&lt;/&gt;Lisa]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[About vegetarian options for replacing the piggier components of braised crucifer recipes...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;As soon as I saw this, I immediately started thinking about what version of pork emulation I&#039;d use. I&#039;ve realized that, whatever vegetarian approach I take, it&#039;s never going to achieve true baconicity (prosciutticity in this case?). &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;So, in addition to doing technique-oriented things to bring out a browner flavor (caramelizing or roasting, for example), we&#039;ve been using tiny amounts of the following in various combinations to compensate for the lack of meat in these kinds of braised vegetable dishes: pimenton (or smoked mild paprika, used in making sausages); smoked cheese (we normally use a hard goat cheese for sharper flavors or gouda for milder); truffle oil (might be nice with the braised cabbage recipe below)...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anyway, it&#039;s a subject close to my heart, thought i&#039;d share. Happy eating!]]></description>
