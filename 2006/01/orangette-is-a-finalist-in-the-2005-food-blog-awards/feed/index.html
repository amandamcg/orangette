					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You completely deserve the honor, but blushing is involuntary. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Would you come back to the food bloggers global map and put in a pin with your motto? Because your nice note to me made ME blush...and I&#039;d rather you toot your own shiny horn than thank me.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;: D&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Fanx!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;&gt;Gooooooodness!&lt;&gt; I thought I had a good reason for blushing before, but now - hot damn!  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Really, you know, the most fun and gratifying part of this whole awards business is having a good excuse to hear from you, dear readers and friends.  Orangette has brought so many new names and faces into the modest orbit of my daily life, and I love every minute of it.  Some of you I&#039;ve had the pleasure of meeting; some I feel as though I &lt;&gt;must&lt;&gt; have met, so many times have our paths and words crossed; and some I am only meeting now, in these comments - and &lt;&gt;all&lt;&gt; I am boundlessly grateful for.  Thank you, thank you. xo]]></description>
