					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Gourmetish, for your good wishes and good thoughts!  I know it&#039;s only a matter of time, but sometimes that time goes so s-l-o-w-l-y.  Cheers to you and your husband for making it through those trials and tribulations - and congratulations to you on your new food blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just came across your blog tonight--it&#039;s great!  I wanted to wish you luck in your long distance trials and tribulations.  My husband and I did that for several years and are finally together.  It&#039;s worth the trouble!  Thank goodness for technology, right?]]></description>
