					<description><![CDATA[Wendy, thank you.  That muffin sounds wonderful!  Do tell: what is Pie in the Sky?  I could go for a gooey jam muffin right now, maybe with some tea...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Michele, your honey habit sounds dangerous, ma cherie.  Better seek treatment soon - or invite me over for some serious eating!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Dairokkan, your sandwich sounds very intriguing - and delicious.  I imagine that a little fruity, sweet-tart jam could be lovely alongside the richness of cheese, chicken, and mayo.  It reminds me of how much I love sneaking red grapes into chicken salad.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Melissa, how could I have forgotten such a classic duo: jam and cheese!  Amen, my friend.  I love a good French sheep&#039;s milk cheese - Ossau Iraty, maybe, or anything semi-firmish from the Pyrenees area or Corsica - with a dark cherry jam.  And then there&#039;s manchego with quince paste, which is almost jam, sort of.  Mmm, mmm.  Thank you, my dear friend.  Oh, and if you &lt;&gt;do&lt;&gt; go out and buy another jar just for this, your secret is safe with me - and, well, the entire Internet.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Sher, a peach Melba jam sounds heavenly.  You must have &lt;&gt;quite&lt;&gt; a collection of ribbons.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oliver, I could really go for a crepe with &lt;&gt;confiture&lt;&gt; this afternoon.  Sigh.  Too bad we don&#039;t have crepe vendors on the streets of Seattle.  Grrr!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kickpleat, you&#039;re in dire straits!  I should hop in the car, head north, and hand-deliver a jar or two.  I would hate to see you suffer, especially when I still have [gasp!] ten jars hanging around...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Lee, it sounds as though you have some very special jams!  Plum with Pinot Noir?  Peach with Lemon Verbena?  It&#039;s enough to make me start itching to add to my collection.  Happy belated birthday, by the way!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Well, thank you, Kevin!  I&#039;m so glad that you found me and Orangette.  Welcome.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nico, I remember that delicious:days post, and I&#039;ve been meaning to make the recipe.  Looks like my time might have come...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;GooberNGrape, it&#039;s my pleasure!  You&#039;re quite an inspiration yourself!  And how about that Gateau Victoire, eh?  Not too bad either...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Katy, your &quot;tangy breakfast bites&quot; look delicious.  Delicate, buttery, rich - and with lemon curd? Perfect with a cup of tea.  Thank you.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Rob, might you share that leavened pancake recipe - and the jam, while you&#039;re at it - anytime soon?  It would be such a good deed for humanity...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I sympathize with your jam woes.  We have a several jars in our cupboard, too.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I love using jam instead of (okay, with) maple syrup on pancakes.  I recently used a pear and vanilla jam on leavened pancakes, and it was unbelievable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, what a great idea. i practiced making Zuni&#039;s gateau victoire yesterday and thought that a jam topper would work well. i didnt have anything good on hand, but bought a black cherry jam. it gave the slices a little more sweetness without having to resort to whipped cream. im sure raspberry or strawberry (or orange?) would have worked in this case, but the cherry was really good. and hooray, no seeds! thank you for providing the inspiration!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I know what you mean with the banana puree ;) I actually discovered this when experimenting with delicious:days&#039; birchermuesli recipe. Try it, just add granola the day you eat it, for the extra crunch :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Umm, yeah, I guess I&#039;m crazier than I thought.  I have entire CASES of homemade preserves in my basement.  So many that today when I was looking for the Plum with Pinot Noir, I gave up and brought up the Peach with Lemon Verbena instead!  I have to say that you inspired me though for my birthday this past Monday I made a cake that would go with jam instead of the chocolate overload that I would have normally indulged in.  Thanks!]]></description>
