					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Janet!  But hmmm, I&#039;m not sure what to tell you.  If more flour didn&#039;t do the trick, well, hmmm.  I&#039;m not sure it would make any difference, but you could try using tapioca as a thickener instead - some people prefer it over flour.  You might give it a try.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Either way, a runny pie is better than no pie at all, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First rhubarb of my garden this year. Made a strawberry rhubarb pie and it was wonderful except that it was way too juicy as it just couldn&#039;t thicken. Did it again today with more flour and it was the same. Any suggestions?  Love you blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lovely post, you&#039;ve captured the fickleness of this in-between time of year so well, although I dare say that here in Scotland winter seems to be doing its best to keep its iron grip on us. Anyhow, it&#039;s funny you should write about rhubarb because I had decided that this will be the spring we&#039;re going to get to know each other better, and what should you offer up but an absolutely gorgeous rhubarb pie. Could there be any better place to start?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amy, that&#039;s my kind of daydream!  If only Sweden were a &lt;&gt;little&lt;&gt; closer to Seattle, my dear, I&#039;d bake you a rhubarb pie.  xo&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Mea culpa, Katy!  I had no idea that I was being such a tease.  You have my condolences on your rhubarbless situation.  That compote of yours sounds wonderful, by the way, and might just inspire me to add more rhubarb to the weekend grocery list.  Oh, and how about that cream-top Brown Cow yogurt, huh?  Wow.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tara, you&#039;re back! And I see from your site that having a wee little Ben isn&#039;t keeping you from making some pretty luscious-looking sweets.  Might a pie be next on the docket? &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Julie, I can imagine few things better than TWO QUARTS(!) of cherries in early March.  As always, you clearly know how to live.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Brian, I have eaten an apple-cranberry pie, but I haven&#039;t made one...yet.  Good idea!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nic, I always wondered what was so strange about So Cal, and I believe I now know.  No rhubarb?  Oh dear.  Maybe an early-spring farmers&#039; market will come to your rescue?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Chris, it&#039;s good to hear from you.  Thanks for stopping by...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great choice for the filling, Molly. I still haven&#039;t seen very much rhubarb down here in So Cal, which reaffirms my belief that it isn&#039;t all that popular in this city. These people don&#039;t know what they&#039;re missing out on: rhubarb pie!]]></description>
