Thanks for being in touch, Angeline! I ran your question by Brandon just now, and he thinks the tomatoes were the problem. If the tomatoes are bland, it takes quite a bit of work to fix them -- salt, sugar, and vinegar, likely. The brands we&#039;ve used are Alta Cucina (from CA; hard to find, but amazing), Muir Glen organic, and San Marzano. Also, you may need more salt. Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Ms. Wizenberg, 
I am falling in love with your books and your recipes. I tried making this recipe last weekend, I loved the technique of adding water and reducing it, over and over. I cooked the onions until they were almost burnt, avoiding the carbon. My version fell flat.  What type of tomatoes/spices do you use? It is possible my spices were closer to pencil shavings.

Thank you for your time. Can&#039;t wait for your new book.

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly and Brandon, 

Ten years later (!): still worth a thank you. 
Haven&#039;t been feeling well the past three days, but today I went for a walk and then made your chana masala when I got home. So very glad I did. THANK YOU. 

Hope you are well, 
Maartje]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Made it today for dinner tonight. Used hot curry paste rather than Garam Masala, ground cardomon, started soaking chick peas yesterday. It is delicious and   will be  a regular at our house. It leaves a great smell in the house. My wife went out as I was cooking it and she said the aroma was magnificent when she returned home.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is one of my favorite recipes to make chole masala. Since I don&#039;t know how to make it my mom&#039;s way, it is nice to have an alternative when I can&#039;t eat her food. Thanks!!]]></description>
