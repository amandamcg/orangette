					<description><![CDATA[I made this flan last night and it was delicious. I have to confess that due to time constraints I didn&#039;t put the asparagus through a sieve, but I food-processed till it was very smooth and creamy and didn&#039;t detect any fibers or skins in the final flan. Thanks for the great recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David, you&#039;re killing me.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kim, you&#039;re very welcome!  I&#039;m so glad to hear that the flan was a success (slanted or no) - and for your &quot;living la vida lo-carb&quot; parents, to boot! &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Helen, the pleasure is all mine.  And that sweet corn flan sounds &lt;&gt;outstanding&lt;&gt;.  Something to experiment with this summer, no doubt...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Fiber, good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I was just looking for a savory flan that would use some spring vegetable and yours looks amazing.  I had a sweet corn flan in a restaurant once that was to die for.  I am sure asparagus would be just as wonderful!  Thanks for a great recipe.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Cheers,&lt;/&gt;-Helen]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly I went ahead and made the flan this weekend and served it with salmon. Blogged it &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.kymmco.com/index.php?id=673&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;&gt;. It was a big hit even if I didn&#039;t notice that my pan was a bit crooked in its water bath and the flan came out slanted to one side. ;) Oh well, that made it look kind of post-modern once sliced with its slanting angles and strange but lovely green color.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks so much for the recipe.]]></description>
