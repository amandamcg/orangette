					<description><![CDATA[My pleasure, Mary Luz!  You know, my father was from Toronto!  He was born and raised there, and came south to the States only after finishing medical school.  I&#039;m headed to Toronto next week, actually, to celebrate his cousin&#039;s husband&#039;s 95th birthday.  Unfortunately, we&#039;ll only be in town for about 24 hours, just long enough for the birthday party and a good night&#039;s sleep!  The next time I&#039;m headed your way, though, I will take you up on that very generous - and awfully tempting - offer...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mmmmmm- nothing better than out-of-the-oven bread. What you&#039;ve written about sounds like a most worthy specimen. I live in Toronto, Ontario- another garden of edible eden in North America. I hope you get a chance to stop by my fair city- if you do- I can set you up with a culinary tour or two-bread included! Gracias to you for the tantalizing treats Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yep, Bay Breads is the mini empire of Pascal Rigo, which incldes bakeries Boulange de Pine, Polk, Cole, and restaurants Chez Nous, Rigolo, Galette Brittany, etc. We in SF will be eternally grateful to this man for his breads, cannele, and more. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And if you ever need a walnut bread tasting partner here in SF, just let me know. I live within walking distance of one of the bakeries--a delicious but dangerous thing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lisa, thank you for the helpful suggestions for better readability.  I hate to make anyone go to extra trouble to comfortably read Orangette - hell, I&#039;m happy that people even remember to stop by! - but for now, pending another solution, it&#039;s a good one.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Foodiechickie, Vancouver is rumored to be a food lover&#039;s paradise, so you can&#039;t go wrong, Seattle or no...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anonymous, thank you for the IE tip!  What a great trick to know!  I learn something new every day around here.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Darlamay, you&#039;re very welcome!  I&#039;m so glad to hear that you gave the Rancho La Puerta granola a go.  And your addition of coconut sounds wonderful.  I just might have to try it myself...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Margrocks, it&#039;ll be waiting for you.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tea, I&#039;m sorry to report that I haven&#039;t - YET - tried the walnut bread from Bay Breads.  That&#039;s the same company that does Boulangerie de Polk, Cole, Pine, etc., right?  And Chez Nous on Fillmore?  Those people know how it&#039;s done!  I have officially added the walnut baguette to my Bay Area must-do list, for whenever that next trip rolls around.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Anonymous, I hardly know what to say.  Please accept my apologies.  I am usually pretty ruthless with typos, but of all places to miss one, this was a terrible spot.  I cut and pasted the address from one of the local newspapers&#039; websites, and I&#039;m afraid that I must have simply missed the first digit.  An easy mistake, but one that resulted in much undue stress - and hunger, to boot!  My apologies.  Please note the corrected address above.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unfair!  Is this some cruel hoax? You tantalize with walnut levain at a fabulous bakery but then give an incorrect address.  It&#039;s at 4865 Rainier Ave S NOT 865.  Poor me - wandering up and down, circling and lurking, google map in hand and nearly faint with hunger and desire.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are a girl after my own heart, Molly! I am addicted to the walnut bread from Bay Breads here in SF--have you tried it? They make a walnut baguette that is divine with cambozola and sliced pears. If I want to take this bread as a gift when invited to a friend&#039;s house for dinner, I&#039;ve learned that I must pick it up on the way to their house. If I buy it in the morning it never survives the day.]]></description>
