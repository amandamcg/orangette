					<description><![CDATA[Molly - I had to post on my poached egg frisee salad experience. I also pay homage to you and the chewy cocoa cookie recipe I added orange flower water to...thank you! &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Eggs in Asian noodle dishes are often &lt;&gt;just&lt;&gt; cooked - in the hot broth. Same yummy enriching eggy goodness. What writer hasn&#039;t found the fried egg sandwich the perfect snack late in the wee hours?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a boiling pot of serendipity the internet can be. I happened upon Orangette after looking for some alternate ways of poaching eggs only to discover this wonderful site after catching the rather curious title.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nonetheless in the short time I&#039;ve flicked through this site I&#039;ve become very enamoured with what Molly has been doing here and will definately be hanging around for more delicious ideas (this broth in particular has my mouth watering).&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anyway this discussion of eggs reminded me of an incredibly decadent egg I had last week that I simply had to share. While I have no actual recipe to divulge (I was eating at a somewhat prestigious Melbourne restaurant and they aren&#039;t given to spilling their secrets ;)) the concept is easy enough to understand and anyone with a bit of cullinary nouse could whip up a dish of similar flavour.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Picture this being brought out on a large, gleaming white, shallow bowl...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;One large perfectly poached egg sitting amidst a rich creamy truffle flavoured white sauce with some thin truffle slices topped by shaved Parmigiano Reggiano. Of course such a creation wouldn&#039;t be complete with out a hint of freshly cracked black pepper to top it off.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever eaten an egg quite like it.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Truffles are far too expensive for every day eating of course but I can imagine a slightly less rich field mushroom variant going down an absolute treat.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good&lt;&gt;ness&lt;&gt;!  Look who&#039;s gotten horribly behind in replying to her very generous commenters!  Sheesh.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Lynn D., what a tricky trick!  Thank you for the tip!  I&#039;ll have to give the ole microwave a go myself...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tara, you are most certainly the queen of peas!  I wish you lived a little closer, so that we could get together for a seasonal blowout of spring pea soup, pea and ricotta crostini, and broth with peas, potatoes, and a poached egg.  I&#039;d even throw in a &quot;sat upon&quot; egg to sweeten the deal.  What do you say?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Amen to that, Anonymous.  And thank &lt;&gt;you&lt;&gt;.  Brown butter is one of the best parlor tricks around.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Keiko, I &lt;&gt;did&lt;&gt; have it every day - for three days, at least!  And what dreamy days those were...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;GooberNGrape, your adaptation sounds incredible!  I&#039;m honored to have served as a springboard for anything involving saffron, white wine, and Montasio.  When are &lt;&gt;you&lt;&gt; starting a food blog, hmm?  Inquiring minds want to read...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tea, I knew that Petaluma was famed for its chickens, but I had no idea that it had such a thing as a &quot;Butter and Egg Day.&quot;  Oh MAN.  I want to be the &quot;Egg Princess&quot;!  Petaluma, I&#039;m your woman!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;D.R., thank you.  I did see that piece - what a funny coincidence!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[PS. Molly, did you know that Petaluma celebrates &quot;Butter and Egg Days&quot; each April? It&#039;s been going on since the early 1900s, when the town of was called &quot;Egg Basket to the World,&quot; due to the local chicken ranching. I&#039;ll see what I can do about getting you nominated for &quot;Egg Princess.&quot;:-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[im sure San Francisco has nothing on Seattle when it comes to rain but i think today is the 28th day of rain this month. this recipe sure was handy.&lt;/&gt;just want to thank you Molly for showing a nice take-- vegetarian, no less-- at a traditional dish like bouillabaisse. i added a few other things on hand to (attempt to) make it more like the original version, except the shell/fish.  &lt;/&gt;i adapted your adaptation.&lt;/&gt;used mostly leftover vegetable broth (not homemade), the rest was water, little garlic, little chili flakes, added pinch of saffron (which ive been looking for an excuse to use), couple tablespoons of white wine, and a handful of chopped parsley stirred in to finish. potatoes and peas are so good together.&lt;/&gt;the fennel in the bouquet is right on-- it adds a great springy layer to the broth.&lt;/&gt;i grated the last of some Montasio over the warm croutons.&lt;/&gt;and the egg! the yolk makes a kind of emulsion with the broth. as someone mentioned previously, it brings the dish together. parlour trickery and all. i had good luck poaching off heat. about 3 minutes for a runny yolk. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;cheers!]]></description>
