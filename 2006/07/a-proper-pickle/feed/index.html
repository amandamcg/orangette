					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a bit ashamed to say that this is the first of your posts that I&#039;ve seen. Since seeing it, I&#039;ve fallen in love with your blog! Since I moved to the Pacific Northwest, I don&#039;t have as many of the cookbooks that I grew up on (especially those by the wonderful Alice Waters) back in the Bay Area. Your blog is keeping me sane!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I keep hearing / reading that ZUNI café in SF invented this recipe... but pink hot pickled onions can be found as a staple side dish on your plate at home-style border/Sonoran / Chihuahuan restaurants. I&#039;ve enjoyed them many years and I&#039;m pretty sure these home/style restaurants never heard of ZUNI. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly&lt;br /&gt;Better late than never they say. In this case what? Five years later! Lovely pickled carrots, I make dilled baby carrots but am always on the lookout for other versions. I&#039;ll try your recipe just as soon as the first crop of baby carrots show up at the neighbourhood farms. Also, I couldn&#039;t help but notice a posters comment on salty brined almonds. Brined amonds? Never heard of such a thing until now.  I did a bit of searching as the thought of pickled almonds was so intriguing. Well... It seems from what I&#039;ve found so far, pickled almonds are imature green almonds and they are only available for a short period of time during the growing season. I&#039;ve copied a paragraph from the California Almond board about pickled almonds, and am adding a couple of links on green almonds, with one being a recipe. Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.What are green almonds? &lt;br /&gt;1.Green almonds are available for a brief three-week period in the growing season from late April to early May, the developing almonds are considered “ripe” for harvest as green almonds. Pickling or brining green almonds will extend the shelf-life of these delicate treats. &lt;br /&gt;2.Green almonds have a jelly-like, soft inside and a soft fuzz on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;3.Due to their short life span, green almonds have always been considered a rare delicacy. They can also be purchased brined or pickled, which extends the life. &lt;br /&gt;4.Green almonds are used by chefs as a cooking ingredient, but also as a garnish.&lt;br /&gt;5.Green almonds have a distinct but subtle flavor that is hard to pin down, but has been variously described as delicate, grassy, fruity, and even green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pickled Tsagala (Green Almonds)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.aglaiakremezi.com/recipies/mezze-appetizers-and-salads/pickled-tsagala-green-almonds.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info on green almonds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://agardenerstable.com/2010/06/25/green-almonds/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is amazing!  My partner love pickles, read this and went to the Boat Street Cafe just last night!  Yum yum yum!  We both looooved the onions there, the garlic, and especially, above all, the fennel!  In the wake of those pickles, we&#039;re left wondering, is there an amazing recipe for pickled fennel?!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just polished off a jar of pickled carrots after reading these comments. My husband and I have a small CSA farm and we put up our excess harvests primarily in pickled form; I&#039;m always looking for new things to try.

					<description><![CDATA[Jen/YVR, your pickles sound &lt;i&gt;amazing&lt;/i&gt;, all of them!  Especially those cucumbers with turmeric!  And the green beans!  You and your mom clearly know your stuff. As for the carrots, though, not to worry.  We eventually made up a pickled carrot recipe that we love, and we served it at our rehearsal dinner, actually.   It uses apple cider vinegar, garlic, thyme, and some hot chile.  (It&#039;s in my book.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you still want to send me some pickles, how can I say no?  Feel free to e-mail me at cheeseandchocolate (at) gmail (dot) com.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly - &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this post went up almost four (!) years ago, but thought I would put in my two cents. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that the baby carrots you tried to do were not your first and last experience with pickled carrots. When done right, they are soooo good. I would say probably my favourite home-pickled vegetable, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of every summer, I spend two weeks at my folks&#039; house, much of which is spent in their garden. I pick baby carrots, baby beets, green beans, and the biggest, oldest cucumbers on the plot. And then my mom and I start a-pickling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We slice the beets into thick coins and cover them in a lightly spiced vinegar and sugar mixture. The resulting deep-purple pickles are the only way I enjoy a beet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We make a small batch of spicy pickled green beans, like an earlier poster mentioned. Perfect in a Caesar (or Bloody Mary, for y&#039;all south of the border).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We take the big, old, tough cukes and use a great, old hand-cranked slicer to shave them into paper-thin rags that get mixed with green and red peppers and onions and a mixture of spices (including turmeric, which gives them a fantastic yellow colour) salt and sugar. Once the mixture has sat for a hour or so, you pack it into jars and top up with a pickling liquid, and there you have bread-and-butter pickles. A sweet-and-sour tangle of slightly soft crunch that is fantastic on sandwiches or just along side a few nice slices of cheese. Or, in my case, eaten with a fork directly from the jar, standing with the fridge door open. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there are the carrots. They have to be baby. And not the &#039;baby&#039; carrots they sell in the grocery store. Proper, from-the-garden, baby carrots. Packed into their jars with whole cloves of garlic and dill, they are magic. I have to ration my jars throughout the year, because I could easily go through my entire stash in the course of a few short months. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#039;t know if you accept gifts like this (is sending pickles to people you&#039;ve never actually met kind of weird?), but if you do, I would love to send you jar to try to and help you see the attraction!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made a batch of these, and now struggling to wait the suggested 48 hours before digging in.  I processed them for longer-term storage (10 minutes in a hot water bath) so only blanched them twice because I was a bit worried that the processing time/heat would render them too soft.  I&#039;m planning to make a big batch to give as holiday gifts, along with other goodies from my backyard.  Will let you know how they turn out...]]></description>
