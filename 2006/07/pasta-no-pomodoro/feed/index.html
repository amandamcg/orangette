					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for the inspiration. I have a zillion blossoms, so half went into the fettuccine. And tomorrow I&#039;ll stuff the rest. I made this with my own stock, double saffron, a small bit of goat cheese, and a shallot. The yolks pulled it all together!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://orangette.net/2006/07/pasta-no-pomodoro/#comment-4413&quot;&gt;Julie&lt;/a&gt;.

Julie, I know this is 12 years later, but I got zucchini blossoms at the Legion Park Farmers Market on Miami&#039;s Upper East Side today.  I&#039;ve only found squash blossoms here in South Florida twice, but this would be the time of year to do so (since fall is our spring). Also I&#039;m guessing if  you&#039;re brave (it&#039;s such a zoo), you might find them at the Yellow-Green Market in Hollywood.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My children have just gobbled this up under the hot Umbrian sun! Zucchini flowers are a fraction of their cost back in the UK, so I couldn&#039;t have made this at home. I think it&#039;s going to be requested again while we&#039;re here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was very tasty. I used fresh thyme instead of parsley and marigold blossoms instead of saffron because I had excess growing in my garden, and added in some garlic. I also tossed in an heirloom slicer tomato shortly before serving because I had some I needed to use up. My fiance was still raving about it the next day. We still had leftovers and he was saying I need to make it again, lol.]]></description>
