					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t say enough about this recipe.  It is truly perfection right down to the method for steaming and then carmelizing the sweet onions, as well as the ratio of onion mixture to pasta.  I did make one small substitution of dry sherry for the 1/2 cup of water to deglaze the pan which gave it a nice added dimension.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone asked how long this takes to make assuming all ingredients are prepared and ready.  I did exactly this, as you should budget time for &quot;lilies&quot; prep. Starting with the first stage - heating the olive oil in the skillet, I would allocate 35 minutes from that point forward to serve in order to get a good carmelization at stage 1 and 2 which is key.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leftovers, if you have any, develop even better.  Thanks Molly for a truly great keeper recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m new to Orangette, however, I heard of the book, took a look and bought it.  It&#039;s a lovingly written, full of reminiscences account of a young woman&#039;s life. Intertwined with stories of meals with family and friends.  Few of us can write as well but we can all relate to the stories in the book. I would think if and when you become a mother what you write will become even more meaningful.  Beautifully written.  Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anonymous, I&#039;m not exactly sure how long it all takes - I&#039;ve never timed it - but it might be helpful to know that you can do some of it ahead of time.  On a couple of occasions now, we have made the onion mixture - the first two paragraphs of the recipe - before our guests came, and then we removed it from the heat and let it sit until we were closer to dinnertime.  I would say that you can do that up to two hours ahead, easy.  Just be sure to rewarm it gently while you cook the pasta.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you know how long this recipe takes, assuming everything is already prepped?  I loved this recipe when you first posted it and would like to pull it out again for a get-together.  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awww, Rosemarie, that makes me so happy.  Never mind the undercooking mishap - when it comes to a meal, the only thing that matters, &lt;&gt;I&lt;&gt; think, is the end result.  And if your dad was happy, hip hip!  Cheers to you and yours.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;bcinfrance, welcome back to our side of the Pond, and to our coast!  What perfect timing to get your fill of those Walla Walla sweets...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Aw, thanks, Jane!  I&#039;m so glad that it was a hit.  I love getting the house all perfumey with onions (or chocolate) before a guest comes over, and this recipe is just the thing for it.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And anonymous, that &quot;spaghetti pizza&quot; sounds fantastic!  It&#039;s almost a frittata, sort of, or the same idea, and I LOVE frittatas.  Thank you for the tip.  Ooh, and about the zucchini blossom pasta, I know.  Isn&#039;t it incredible?  A real keeper.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[any leftovers also make a fantastic and decadent &quot;spaghetti pizza&quot;- from a recipe in Everyday Italian- mix up 2 eggs, 1/2c milk, 1c parmesan, 1/2t salt, 1/2t pepper. toss in 2 c of your past.heat 1/4c olive oil (recipe calls for 1/2 c, but I used 1/4c and it was adequate in my pan, which is really well-seasoned)in your 10&quot; skillet, when oil is hot, add the pasta mixture and let cook for about 8 minutes, until crispy. using a plate, flip the pasta out of the pan, onto the plate, and back into the pan again (on uncooked side) and cook another 6 minutes. flip out of pan again, cut into wedges and serve. mmmmm.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I also made the zucchini blossom recipe that another reader suggested (and today I noticed you tried it too) so delicious!]]></description>
