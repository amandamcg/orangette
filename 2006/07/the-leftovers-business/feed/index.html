					<description><![CDATA[sbs, I&#039;m so sorry!  That sounds awful.  I wish I knew what went wrong.  My two guesses are: 1) could your baking powder be old?  That could certainly cause the cake to not rise well. And 2) as for the cake not baking through, do you keep a thermometer in your oven?  I wonder if your oven is running too cold?  Wish I could be of more help...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read all through the comments today looking for others that might have found tweeks necessary to keep the cake from being solid. I have made it twice, both times in a regular bundt pan, with no recipe modifications.  I adored the flavors but it had to bake more than twice as long as directed and it still was the consistency of fudge on the inside.  It didn&#039;t ever seem to rise very much.  Help!  What do I add more of or less of?  Thanks for any advice you can offer.  ]]></description>
