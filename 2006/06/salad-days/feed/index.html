					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Molly. I know this recipe is old, but I made it tonight and loooved it. It&#039;s been extremely hot the last few days, and this really did hit the spot. Something about the alchemy of the ingredients is just perfect--the feta/lime/onion combo is amazing. Just wanted to say thanks for helping me find something that actually sounded (and tasted) good when it&#039;s 100 degrees out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aww, thank you, Sara!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You&#039;re most welcome, sarahww.  And your addition of toasted pine nuts sounds wonderful!  We&#039;ll have to try that next time...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hello there, elle - so glad that you made your way over here!  Say, could you tell me which magazine that was, and when it came out?  I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve seen it, and you&#039;ve piqued my curiosity...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you for the congrats, Janice, and for telling me about that Citizen Cake salad.  It sounds &lt;&gt;heavenly&lt;&gt;.  I just ate lunch, but my stomach is grumbling a little, just thinking of it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just discovered your lovely (and addictive) blog! Very happy to hear of your engagement, especially since I know what it&#039;s like to be in a very long distance relationship myself. Congrats!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;For another simple salad, I like one from Citizen Cake-- hearts of romaine, chunky bits of bacon, cool slices of radish, and a buttermilk bleu cheese dressing. Delish!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, J.Bo!  And as for the ingenious Alice Waters, I&#039;d be right next to you in line...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Glad to hear it, Tanna.  I hope you enjoyed it as much as we do!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Dianka!  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Luisa, I know!  The renter&#039;s market in Seattle does have its small wonders.  Ours is not &lt;&gt;really&lt;&gt; an entire house, but rather a duplex in a house.  The house is split right now the middle, though, rather than by levels, so it feels like a little entity in itself.  We have a bedroom, kitchen, living room, bathroom, etc. on the ground floor, and then we have a daylight basement with a second bedroom, washer and drier, and finished garage-type area for Brandon to set up a big, manly workbench.  And a side patio AND a yard!  And cheap!  It&#039;s almost paradise, I tell you.  And with room for guests too...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Katie, I&#039;m so glad to hear that you found the cookies - and that you, like me, think it&#039;s never too hot for baking something chocolatey!  I almost fired up the oven this weekend, actually, for a batch of oatmeal chocolate chip cookies - but then the ice cream in the freezer pulled me away.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Ana Blackburn, this salad would be really delicious with some cold roasted chicken.  Come to think of it, I wish I had some lying around myself.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Emily, and congratulations to &lt;&gt;you&lt;&gt; on your new site!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Alice, amen to all that: cheese, wine, bread, salad!  [Sounds an awful lot like my dinner tonight, actually!]  And as for your doughnut muffins, they&#039;re beautiful.  I&#039;ll have to try your cinnamon sugar version - it&#039;s a lovely variation!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Astillac, you know what they say about great minds!  And as for Seattle, hmmm.  It depends on what kind of neighborhood you might like, where you want to go to school, and whether you want to rent or buy.  Seattle is full of little neighborhoods - not unlike San Francisco, say - and each is quite different.  So that I don&#039;t blather on endlessly here, how about you send me an e-mail, and I&#039;ll see if I can dredge up a few suggestions or starting points?  Sound good?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Lobstersquad, I hear you on those IKEA things - sometimes the assembly is FAR more trouble than it&#039;s worth.  Ooof.  But this salad, on the contrary, is worth every second - and it doesn&#039;t take many, at that!  Hope you enjoy it.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;GoobernGrape, you always have the tastiest suggestions.  Hot damn!  How could I forget my poached eggs?  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;From our Kitchen, I hope this salad hits the spot!  I just hopped over to your site, and it looks as though you&#039;ve been making some pretty little salads too.  I&#039;d take a plate of your &quot;mini&quot; Caprese any day.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Roland, you&#039;re very welcome.  And big cheers for romaine!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Garrett, thanks for reminding me of my old faithful &lt;&gt;Zuni Cookbook&lt;&gt;!  I sometimes forget about the salads in there, and you&#039;re right - they&#039;re exquisite.  The salad you mention sounds delicious - so many good flavors on a single plate!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tony, that salad sounds &lt;&gt;sensational&lt;&gt;.  And I&#039;ll bet Brandon would love it too - minus the prosciutto, of course.  [That means there&#039;s more for me!]  Thank you.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I will, Jules!  Your site is beautiful, by the way.  And I love the look of those almond puddings you made last month...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;It&#039;s my pleasure, Christine!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I try to bring a salad to work whenever I can, at least 3x a week. Thank you for giving me another version to try, since I&#039;m getting a little tired of my usual mixed greens w/arugula and raspberry vinaigrette. :)]]></description>
