					<description><![CDATA[I just made these and I have to say that they didn&#039;t turn out exactly as I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The yolk mixture was pretty runny and didn&#039;t really set up correctly. I guess it could&#039;ve been something I did, but I&#039;m pretty sure I followed the recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dig the idea though.  I&#039;m gonna work on it some more I think.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So yummy! Deviled eggs held a special place on our Seattle wedding menu as well.  I loved the way they were presented - cut in half the short way (like little cups of deviled love) and placed on a bed of chives.  Beauty and simplicity!  Congratulations on your upcoming nupuals and love your site!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We had deviled eggs at our very low key BBQ wedding reception and they are what I remember most/best.  A good friend made them and they were DIVINE!  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I think all weddings should serve deviled eggs, but I may be odd that way :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, I know I&#039;ve come late to the devilish egg discussion, but I DO love them so!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I admit these eggs tend to be my project with the assembled kids at family Thanksgivings, and experience reveals that the young&#039;uns LOVE using the star-tube-in-zip-top-bag application for filling the eggs (or &quot;yeggs,&quot; as the younger ones have called them).  It can get a little giggly and messy, but more fun is not to be had under any circumstances... and the results are are DAMNED TASTY, TOO!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;In MY family tradition, we do hard-cooked eggs according to the method of the late great Sainted Julia Child, smush up the yolks extra smooth with homemade mayo, Dijon or (my preference) Gulden&#039;s mustard, a hint of garlic (use your rasp grater!), finely ground black pepper, a squirt of Tabasco or Sriracha and-- CRUCIAL INGREDIENT ALERT!!-- some liquid smoke.  Paprika or chopped chives or parsley get sprinkled on top, depending on whose kitchen I&#039;m occupying.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;ve got a shameful number of Depression glass egg plates-- you know, the kind with the molded indents to hold your deviled treasures-- and every year I obsess over which one to use.  I&#039;m thinking perhaps one of them belongs on your reception table...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;SO, Miss Molly... here&#039;s to wonderful &quot;yeggs,&quot; a wonderful wedding, and wonderful family traditions of your own making.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nah, Trish, it&#039;s not weird.  Egg salad can be chunky and lumpy and often faaaar to mayonnaisey - deviled eggs are much smoother going down, I&#039;d say.  And as for the wedding, I&#039;m so glad that you understand.  When I tell people our date, they often question me on such a long engagement, but to us, it seems perfectly logical - and much more enjoyable!  Brandon and I both have &lt;&gt;a lot&lt;&gt; going on in the coming year - his moving to Seattle being the least of it! - and we just want to enjoy the process.  Cheers to you and your husband, and to details.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;SweetSarahJ, your husband is not alone.  My dear Brandon - gasp! - probably won&#039;t be eating any of these either.  He has mayonnaise &quot;issues,&quot; among other things, and he&#039;s wary of hard-boiled eggs.  But don&#039;t worry about him - he has his own must-have food ideas for the reception and dinner, so we&#039;ll get all of our favorites: mine, his, and ours.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;86 days away, astillac - congratulations, and godspeed!  Very, very exciting.  And how nice to have had a deviled egg conversion along the way...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Natalie, I hear you.  In my experience, these little babies just fly off the serving platter - or maybe it&#039;s only because I&#039;m eating them all?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Briana, I &lt;&gt;love&lt;&gt; the idea of your sexy Sunday moment over deviled eggs - hot damn.  And as for kenziekate.blogspot.com, thank you for the tip!  I hopped over there and spent nearly an entire hour poking around, looking at her links, etc.  She also makes some lovely invitations.  Yum.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kickpleat, I must have known, but I had forgotten that you and Cornelius were married only so recently!  Congratulations, my dear, and happy, happy (early) anniversary.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Brian Gardunia, I love the mental image of that - a bunch of little boys hiding out with their deviled eggs!  I&#039;m sure that, had I been there, I would have been busy doing the same.  Too cute.]]></description>
