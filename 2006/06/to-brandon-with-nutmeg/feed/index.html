					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;Love your writing,recipes,your book! and love story.  I mentioned these doughnut muffins to my friend hosting a baby shower and she made them!  They are soooo-Yummy!  She made them into mini muffins.  We are wondering how to print just the recipe, she printed  it and a bunch of extra pages followed, is there a print recipe we are not seeing?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much, from two Flight Attendants from Wisconsin!  &lt;br /&gt;Shannon]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I appreciate how open you are in this blog, the glimpse into your blessed life that you allow us to see. I&#039;m still slowly working through your archives since finding your site a year ago and this post (both in content and recipe) is one to remember. Sounds like you&#039;ve got a great husband...he&#039;s got a lovely wife too. Okay, I&#039;m beginning to feel a bit stalkerish, so I&#039;ll stop! I wish many happy years upon you both.]]></description>
