					<description><![CDATA[So close...but not quite what I’ve been seeking ! Yours looks yummy, for sure tho! Perhaps you could help me find a recipe I tucked away many years ago when as an Army wife and left behind in VIrginia when we had orders for Kansas. 
It was a pie crust baked in a 9” square pan, then topped with applesauce and ...a missing forgotten ingredient...then covered with a fluffy white meringue, lightly baked til golden.  
It was a quick and simple dessert for me as a new bride and made my novice cooking worth eating when it was added as the dessert.  I’ve tried replicating but the missing part is a vital thing and it keeps eluding me ! 
Thanks for any help you can send me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anonymous, meringue is really pretty easy.  The most important thing in this case is to add the sugar very slowly and gradually - otherwise, the meringue gets very heavy and won&#039;t ever reach the right texture.   For this recipe, you&#039;ll know that your meringue is ready when it is a bright, opaque white; looks quite glossy and silky under the light; and holds peaks that curl over lightly at their tips.   This photo is a pretty good guide: &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.scottmindeaux.com/graphics/new_culinary/meringue.jpg&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;click&lt;&gt;. The meringue should not look dry or at all Styrofoam-y; if it does, you may have beaten it for too long. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I hope this helps at least a little!  Be not afraid, and you&#039;ll be surprised by how easy it is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[molly, i&#039;ve never made meringue before, should it be stiff enough to hold the peaks? frothy? should it have peaks that dissolve?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gregg, you&#039;re very welcome!  I&#039;m always happy to provide dessert, even from a distance.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Deanna, hmm, I&#039;m not sure why your meringue deflated - where is my kitchen scientist when I need one? - but I&#039;m glad that you persevered at the table!  I think it&#039;s an ooher and an aaher too.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;GooberNGrape, you do not disappoint.  And your poor man&#039;s apple pie?  I can hardly wait for the next installment!  In the meantime, I&#039;d better get myself some vanilla sugar...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[gilding the lily, pt II.&lt;/&gt;always behind,&lt;/&gt;last week i finally tried the applesauce and meringue both with vanilla sugar. it made the applesauce just about as delicious as i could imagine.&lt;/&gt;the meringue was good too, like poor man&#039;s marshmallows. the cap was nice and crunchy, but because i probably piped the merinque too thick, the stuff on the inside was soft and &lt;&gt;very&lt;&gt; marshmallowy-- almost too rich for the applesauce. interesting experiment though.&lt;/&gt;next time, im going to drape a small square of puff dough over the top of the ramekins instead-- poor man&#039;s apple pie?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was spellbound by the lush promise of this recipe, but it left me obsessive about the beauty secrets of pretty meringue. My attempt became cracked, golden, interesting...and then promptly deflated when it began to cool. Sans presentation, my guy loved it! We Ohhed and aaahed between warm spoonfulls cooled inside softened vanilla ice cream.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a great recipe!&lt;/&gt;I was looking at your blog the other day and I thought this looked like a great dessert that I could use after a heavy main course. So I tried it on the weekend and it was a total hit - thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made some chunky applesauce the other day for pork chops and as I ate this lovely combo of sweet and savory I promised myself I would make applesauce more often. Now I have an excuse. Thanks!]]></description>
