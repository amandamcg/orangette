Very impressive.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Aww, thank you, ma chere Luisa.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And secretary, I am so sorry to hear about your sad cauliflower.  When it is slicked with oil, salted, and caramelized to within an inch of its life, it is one of my favorite standbys, and I hope it becomes one of yours too!
