					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m smiling right now! I found this post from your recipe index and just had to laugh at your description of the type of shopper you are. So like me! Kitchen shops get me every time, I cannot walk past, and I cannot come out without buying something. I have a madeleine pan (from one such shopping trip) and will be trying these very soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I&#039;m hoping against hope that you see this -- I want to make these as the favor for my medium-sized wedding, and have had great luck so far baking batches (though I&#039;ve used Ghirardelli&#039;s 60% bars, not their semisweet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However: the glaze.  Can you bake and freeze them with the glaze, or should you bake, defrost, then glaze?  I&#039;m concerned because they are going in see-through bags with a ribbon and another favor.  I&#039;ve got a test batch glazed and the fat in the butter and chocolate is producing an unappealing opaque white color as it cools in the freezer.  I would appreciate any suggestions!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I almost died when I tried these. Such a delicious, grown up treat. I made them on Thanksgiving Day and took them to my in-laws...the fools went for pumpkin pie instead and I got to gobble up the majority myself. I will definitely make them again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The gang, wow, I&#039;m so very sorry!  I don&#039;t know what to tell you.  I&#039;m inclined to think that it&#039;s something about your pan.  Is it nonstick?  Hmmm.  And is your oven properly calibrated?  I keep an oven thermometer in mine because I know that its own internal thermometer is &lt;&gt;waaay&lt;&gt; not accurate.  That may not be the culprit here, but it helps rule out one possible source of trouble.  Gosh, aside from that, I don&#039;t know what to say.  I&#039;m really sorry.  I&#039;ll be sending good madeleine thoughts your way...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[weird...i&#039;ve tried this recipe twice now, followed it to the teaspoon, and each time they&#039;ve stuck to the bottom, were burnt on the bottom, were undercooked..boo! Tried a lower temp, greasing them more, but to no avail! Any suggestions, Molly? I&#039;m an avid reader, always have luck with all your stuff, but this one leaves me stuck! This recipe looks too good to give up on!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Margrocks, so glad to hear that your officemates have such fantastic taste.  Or rather, &lt;&gt;fantastique&lt;&gt;, I should say...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And as for Seattle, well, I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t have a book, per se, to recommend.  I had a sort of food lover&#039;s guide to Seattle that I used when I first moved here, but it&#039;s now pretty outdated.  I have a better idea: if you like, I&#039;ll give you my own personal suggestions - and free of charge, no less!  Why don&#039;t you drop me an e-mail, and I&#039;ll steer you toward some of my favorite spots?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Elizabeth&amp;Caroline, thank you. I&#039;m so happy to hear of your madeleine success! [Not that I was worried, of course, but when you really love a recipe, it&#039;s always nice to add more voices to the cheering section!]  I would have never thought to use pine nuts - very inventive!  Cheers to you both.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Katy, you mean to tell me that you had 100 dollars, and you &lt;&gt;didn&#039;t&lt;&gt; buy a madeleine pan?  The SHAME!  Get back to that store this instant!  A little more shopping is just the punishment you need...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Margrocks, am I to take it that you bought that madeleine pan?  Bravo!  I&#039;m so glad to hear that you made the madeleines - and that they have your seal of approval, no less.  Hope your officemates know how lucky they are...]]></description>
