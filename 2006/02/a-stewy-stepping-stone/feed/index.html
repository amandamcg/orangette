					<description><![CDATA[My first mother-in-law was the best big-meat and game-meat cook I ever knew.  She would do a whole tenderloin for 45 min at like 400 degrees and it would be medium rare when she brought it out.  That astonished me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s exactly how I feel about large cuts of meat! I&#039;ve mastered the roast chicken and buy boneless chuck roasts for the crock pot, but now I&#039;m stuck. My friends laugh when I say the only cooking class I want is one where they&#039;ll teach me something new about roast lamb.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pork tenderloin is just the thing!  No matter how you treat it - braise, roast, stir-fry, it is always tasty and tender and confidence-building.  When you&#039;re ready to take the plunge into Big Meat, I recommend roasting a boneless leg of lamb - impossible not to love!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hageltoast, your roast sounds dreamy!  Anything that can be described using the words &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;seeped into the meat&quot; gets a hearty nod from me.  Must roast beef, must roast beef...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Luisa, I thought of you when I was writing this!  I know, roasted pork tenderloin is certainly not a complicated thing to cook, but somehow, I still let myself be wooed away by Lynne Rossetto Kasper&#039;s more dainty preparation.  I&#039;ll trade up now, though, for Barbara Kafka.  If you can conquer a slab of raw pork belly, by god, I can take down a tenderloin. Oh, and speaking of that pork belly, how is your bacon supply coming along?  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tanya, my dear, you are too sweet!  And yes, you &lt;&gt;must&lt;&gt; give pork tenderloin another go.  Banish all thoughts of its slug-like shape: just remind yourself of how fantastically tender it will be, this lovely little-worked muscle!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kalyn, I&#039;m relieved to know that I&#039;m not alone in my Big Meat fears.  I conquered my slight queasiness over handling raw meat when I first started roasting chickens, but now I think my trepidation comes mainly from a sense of not knowing, frankly, how to best cook the stuff.  I think it&#039;s a matter of knowledge - or lack thereof.  I need to spend more time reading about different cuts, really, and just playing with different meats and techniques.  In the meantime, though, more pork with vinegar and peppers!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tana, who are you calling a whippersnapper, hmm?  I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been called that since my grade-school music teacher - the raven-haired Mrs. Havens - threatened to send me to the headmistress&#039;s office for talking to my neighbor during &quot;The Button Song.&quot;  But nonetheless, thank you, thank you, thank you!  Your pork tenderloin looks &lt;&gt;outrageously&lt;&gt; good.  It&#039;s officially on the &quot;to do&quot; list...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Frankenstein, I know, I know.  I will take your advice to heart, especially where the &quot;cooking&quot; wine is concerned!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hag, go after that Big Meat!  Fear no more, I say!  But as for that Tofurkey, I don&#039;t know...I think fear is actually warranted there.  I&#039;m sure that it more than satisfies for some, but it only makes me shudder.  Thankfully, Brandon (a.k.a. &quot;my vegetarian&quot;) feels the same way...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Zeebleoop, now you&#039;re speaking &lt;&gt;my&lt;&gt; language!  Your description alone makes my mouth water...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ah, meat!  now you&#039;re talking my language.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;i think there is nothing better than the magic trick that is taking a cheap cut of meat and by means of low, slow heat transforming it into a luscious, fall-apart-tender meal.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;and don&#039;t even get me started on barbeque - heaven!]]></description>
