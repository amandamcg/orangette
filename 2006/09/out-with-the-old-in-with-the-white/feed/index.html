					<description><![CDATA[I love the white background! It&#039;s especially flattering to your photos. I&#039;m considering tinkering with my own site, but I don&#039;t know when I&#039;ll ever find the time. Congrats on the new look.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved old Orangette and I love new Orangette too. So classy looking! I find my favorite blogs are white--not mine, mind you (at least not yet). &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Congrats on your new digs. Feels very conducive to creativity--I&#039;m looking forward to seeing what you create in this beautiful, clean new world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The new look is fabulous! I liked the old look, too, but I&#039;m another one of those (older) people who found the white-on-black scheme hard to read. I still read your blog, of course (one must!), but this is definitely a change I&#039;ll enjoy. Not just for easier reading but also because it&#039;s so overall new and pretty. The photo in the banner is lovely.]]></description>
