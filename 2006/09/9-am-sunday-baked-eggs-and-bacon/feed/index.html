					<description><![CDATA[Lia, I&#039;m so happy to hear it!  All bow down before Jimmy...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Welcome, Anneke - so glad you found your way over to Orangette!  I&#039;m sorry to have taken a few days to get back to you about those hash browns.  I wanted to discuss hash brown cookery with Brandon, who is Mr. Hash Brown around here.  Here are some rough guidelines:&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;- Hash browns come in many shapes and sizes.  Some people like to dice their potatoes; some use small potatoes and halve or quarter them, as Jimmy does; and actually, most people grate their potatoes.  Technically, Jimmy&#039;s potatoes aren&#039;t true &quot;hash browns&quot; because they are made with such big hunks of potato.  They should probably be called &quot;breakfast potatoes.&quot;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;- If you want to use halved or quartered small potatoes, as Jimmy does, you should boil them a little first.  Cut them into your desired size and boil them in lightly salted water until they are just tender (but not falling apart).  Drain and dry them.  Warm butter or oil in a large skillet over medium heat (Brandon prefers medium-high), and add finely chopped onions, chopped bell peppers (whatever color you like), and the parboiled potatoes.  Cook them all together until the potatoes are tender and lightly golden, and the onions and peppers are tender as well.  Seasoned with salt and pepper, your &quot;Jimmy-style&quot; breakfast potatoes are ready.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;- If you want to use diced or grated potatoes, there is no need to boil them beforehand, but you can expect to use more oil or other fat than you would use with a parboiled potato.]]></description>

I&#039;m from the Netherlands and have no clue how they&#039;re made, but I&#039;d love to try out the whole breakfast as you wrote about in this entry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just had to let you know that my husband and I treated our friends to these baked eggs and spicy bacon this weekend and OH MY GOD. They were absolutely unbelieveable. Though we did mess up a few steps with the eggs, we were still amazed with how delicious they were and I definitely found them to be fairly light (even with the creme fraiche and pieces of cheese). Goodbye scrambled, hello ouefs a la cantalienne! &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Jimmy truly is a genius and I am now even more jealous of how lucky you are to have him cook for you! Now I can&#039;t wait to try those shortbread waffles...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, hag!  We owe it all to Jimmy.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Mary, I hear you.  I&#039;ve got the straight husband figured out, but I&#039;m still on the lookout for a gay one...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tara, after breakfasts like these, a nap is almost a necessity - don&#039;t even &lt;&gt;try&lt;&gt; to fight it!  You know, truth be told, I think the world would be a much better place if we went back to bed after breakfast every day.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;h, that makes me so happy!  Thank you for reporting back.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;What a Sunday, Anonymous!  And thank you for the tip about the bacon.  Hear that, everyone?  Watch it carefully!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Rebecca and Jimmy, I am SO glad that you&#039;re home - at long last! - and cannot wait for some of that super-duper gay greatness!  When can we come over, hmm?   P.S. Rebecca, your e-mails nearly killed me.  When are you writing your first book?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Me too, arielle - waistline be damned!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Frida, have you made the bacon yet?  Hurry!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You&#039;re very welcome, Anonymous!  Jimmy, are you reading this?  You should be proud.]]></description>
