					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the birthday wishes, Laura!  And welcome to the blogosphere!  Very happy to have you.  But now, as for the lifespan of goat cheese, hmm.  I haven&#039;t noticed its short shelf life, but maybe that&#039;s because I eat it so quickly!  If you&#039;re having trouble with spoilage, yes, these marinated versions should last a good deal longer.  The olive oil helps to preserve and protect the cheese.  I can&#039;t say for sure, though, just how long it will last, because honestly, this stuff usually gets eaten right away...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Go for it, supereric.  Steal away!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Annie, I&#039;m so sorry that I didn&#039;t get a chance to answer your e-mail sooner.  Your party is now long over, I&#039;m afraid!  So sorry.  I hope you found a good, affordable oil - did you?  If so, what did you choose?  I find that Whole Foods&#039;s 365-brand olive oil is quite good for everyday use, but for recipes like this one, I also like a more refined flavor.  For that reason, I try to keep a couple of types in the pantry - nothing too expensive, but good.  Unfortunately, I almost never buy the same one twice, mainly because I can never remember what I bought!  Argh. Do you have a specialty store nearby that will let you taste a few oils?  If not, I can tell you this: a California company called Stonehouse Olive Oil makes nice ones for not-too-terrible prices.  I think they may even be available at Williams-Sonoma stores, which makes them somewhat easy to get your hands on.  &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.stonehouseoliveoil.com/&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&lt;&gt;&#039;s their website.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Poopycat, hope you found something to nibble on...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hannah, how funny that Brandon and David share the same birthday!  Wish we could have had you two over for a little sipping and standing around and good times...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, dear Shari! And xo too.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;S&#039;kat, happy belated birthday to you!  Hope you had a good one - maybe with some goat cheese and herbs?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Scott, I hope you give this a whirl - it&#039;s about time!  And if you do try it with mozzarella, let me know.  Sounds like a great alternative...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Acme Instant Food.  I feel very, very lucky.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Yikes, Melissa!  Brandon and I are going to have to start bulking up on trivia in anticipation of Christmas.  You and Manuel had better play nice!  Perhaps if I ply you with some of my great-grandfather&#039;s boozy egg nog, we can win by default?  Heck, it&#039;s better than losing outright, I guess.  But in the meantime, thank you for the perfectly timed birthday wishes!  I was in Oklahoma when I read them, gearing up for an evening of rare steak and Grand Marnier souffle.  It was a very happy birthday.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Welcome, Saltyknees!  So glad that you found me - and by the way, I love your screen name.  And as for this business of solidified olive oil, I know just what you mean.  The oil solidifies slightly when I refrigerate my marinated goat cheeses too, and also in my vinaigrettes and other oil-heavy things.  I know of no way to get around it, I&#039;m sorry to say.  It just means planning ahead a bit, so that you leave time to let the oil and cheese warm up before serving.  You know, a little delayed gratification.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Susan, that is SO sweet - and it sounds SO delicious.  Brandon, are you reading this?  Where are my lobster medallions?  Harumph.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Boring, that dream is too funny!  Really, really funny.  But I promise, when we do get married - which, I assure you, isn&#039;t until next July! - I will try to stay low-key about the wedding band shots.  Only one.  Or maybe two.  I think.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;My thoughts exactly, Natalia.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;LPC, it &lt;&gt;is&lt;&gt; pretty amazing how versatile chevre is.  It&#039;s sort of the cameleon of cheeses, you know?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Jamie, I should have guessed that you&#039;d be all over the okra!  I&#039;m going to e-mail Keaton right now and see if I can get the recipe...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OK, your goat cheese sounds and looks fantastic (you know if it contains any lemon at all I&#039;m on board).  I would also add some fresh cracker pepper I think... but can you please, please, please finagle that sweet onion/okra/tomato recipe out of your friend?  It sounds simply heavenly.  You can e-mail it to me if you don&#039;t feel like posting it.  Thanks~]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, yum, this sounds so good. I just saw Barefoot Contessa make a salad with pan fried chevre the other day and I have been craving it. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;(Side note: I had to check your blog this morning because last night--I promise I&#039;m not a creepy stalker--I had a dream that you were married and everyone in the world was talking about it and I didn&#039;t believe it until I came here and noticed that every picture of food also had a picture of your left ring finger with a wedding band on it).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi!  I&#039;ve only just run across your Blog.  I&#039;ll be a regular visitor now ... lurking, lurking, waiting for wee tasty morsels like these.  You know, I made some of these a while back I think it was September, intent on marinating them in the back opf my fridge until Xmas as a special treat.  They somehow did survive and my S.O. and I enjoyed them immensely during the Festive Season.  The only thing that I experienced that I didn&#039;t understand was that the EVOO I used solidified encasing the cheeses.  I had to basically warm the contents back to room temp before enjoying and that was just too long!!!  Doese anyone have a suggestion or remedy or is this just supposed to happen?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happy Birthday, dear Molly! I even timed it right with the comment, didn&#039;t I? And of course a (slightly belated) happy birthday to Brandon too. I hope your day is sunny, warm, and full of cheese (marinated? goat?), chocolate, and uncountable other delicious things.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And so funny about the TP. The game has a long and convoluted history in my family -  my parents, for example, are obsessive players and claim to have NEVER been beaten as a couple. Nevertheless, a few years ago Manuel and I came within one question of beating them, and since then they&#039;ve always found a convenient excuse to avoid playing us. Perhaps you and Brandon will be up to the challenge at Xmas? ;)]]></description>
