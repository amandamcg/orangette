					<description><![CDATA[Awesome cookies. I just found the recipe and am making them for a second time tonight. Being a coffee fanatic, I upped the espresso to 2 tsp (!) and used a med-roast (Stumptown) coffee so the flavor still stayed sweet but not overwhelming. Thanks for the recipe!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A note about unsulfured apricots:&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;They are called &quot;sun-dried apricots&quot; here in Turkey (of course in Turkish lol). &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I guess it&#039;s a common name for all naturally dried fruits and vegetables.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I love sundried apricots as they have a bake-y, chocolate-y, and healthy taste, too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John-Michael, you are one heck of a brave man to go back through an old &lt;&gt;Logos&lt;&gt;!  I applaud you.  And congratulations on all your good news!  I&#039;m so glad to hear that you&#039;re enjoying your grad program, and that you&#039;re swoony about a special someone!  All my best to both of you.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Fran!]]></description>
