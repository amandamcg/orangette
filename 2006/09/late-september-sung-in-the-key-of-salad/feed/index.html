					<description><![CDATA[Carol, I hope this salad earns a spot in your repertoire too, right next to the chickpeas!  As for arugula, my mother grows it in her garden in Oklahoma, where it gets maddeningly peppery from the intense summer heat, but I haven&#039;t tried it myself.  How good to know that it can be grown in a pot!  Another bit of greenery to add to our patio...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Well, thank you, always learning!  Those macaroons are pretty heavenly, in my humble opinion.  I hope you agree.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Mary, I would be more than happy to share some of my favorite Seattle spots!  I have a running list that I keep just for the purpose of sharing, and if you&#039;ll drop me an e-mail, I&#039;ll zip it off to you.  (It&#039;s a little long to post here.)  You can find my e-mail address by clicking on &quot;View my complete profile&quot; in the right-hand sidebar above.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks, Natalia!  And three cheers for the change of seasons!  I am not a huge fan of change in general, but change of seasons, oh yes.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Lia, hmmm, I&#039;m not sure about this NYC bias of yours, lady.  Maybe I should hop a plane to New York and do a comparison myself.  It&#039;s a good excuse for playing hooky, don&#039;t you think?  &lt;&gt;Sigh.&lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oh my god, s&#039;kat, maybe that&#039;s where my line came from!  All of a sudden, it popped into my head, just like that - but sheeesh!  Now that you mention it, maybe it was a memory castaway from the Holy Grail?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oh, Julie, I feel for you!  Are you home yet?  Is your chicken in the oven?  I hope so. xo&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Alright, Hannah, when are the Huffmans landing in Seattle?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hip hip!  I&#039;m so glad to hear it, pomegranate.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kim, you&#039;re very welcome - and thank &lt;&gt;you&lt;&gt;.  Your description of your 20s in Seattle sounds very familiar...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Orangette,&lt;/&gt;You constantly remind me of being in my 20s in Seattle: working at the Elliott Bay Bookstore, grocery shopping at Pike Place, my first subscription to Gourmet, my first adult love, and the moody arrival of fall.

					<description><![CDATA[Oh yum.  As soon as I get back to NYC, I&#039;m going to the Greenmarket for wild arugula and roasting a nice free-range chicken, just for this.  Right now I&#039;m in a Doubletree Hotel in Missoula, Montana, and the thought of real, delicious food like this rather than hotel (aka imitation) food is driving me quite mad...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fall is by far my favorite season. I love them all, but there&#039;s something about that crisp air and the gorgeous foliage. I think it&#039;s particularly wonderful in NYC, but I could be biased. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And as for your salads, I usually bring homemade ones to work for lunch (often leaving me starving by the time dinner rolls around), so you have me rethinking when I should have them. Maybe a heartier lunch and a nice light, fall salad for dinner? Yum.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh yes, I am looking forward to fall too.  The change of the seasons is one of the best parts of life.  New weather, new clothes, and, most importantly new food.  Of course, your salad looks lovely and delicious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I understand exactly how you feel about fall. Vancouver&#039;s the same way, lots of cloud and rain, but somehow it feels rejuvenating. I was in Seattle last week and it was raining, of course, but it was still beautiful and had lots of buzz. Btw, can you recommend a couple of your favorite casual dining spots for my next trip down?  Thanks in advance.  I can&#039;t wait to try more of your fall recipes!]]></description>
