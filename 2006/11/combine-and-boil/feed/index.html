					<description><![CDATA[I have been making this for a couple of years with success. It isn&#039;t as savory as other chutneys I have made i.e.: no onions or the like but it works. I use it on baked brie, boursin cheese and on an old cheddar grilled cheese sandwich that will make you weep. I just made a batch tonight. Our Canadian Thanksgiving celebration is at the beginning of October so by now most of us have emerged from our turkey comas and ready to have a go at the big bird again for Christmas. I have to say I think it is hilarious that you state the servings as 8-10 people. This recipe yielded 8 cups for me. Your people must REALLY love this stuff. Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this for the first time last year, and it is now my go-to recipe for Thanksgiving.  Come to think of it, I don&#039;t know why I don&#039;t make it more often.  There is nothing better than cranberry sauce on a turkey sandwich.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this last year for the first time while I was living abroad and cooking a Thanksgiving meal for four Brits, an Australian, and two South Africans. I had to improvise: raw ginger, no candied, dried cranberries, not cherries, orange preserves instead of apricot, and apple for raspberry vinegar. I also had no oven, only a small toaster, and made people sit on the floor. It was SO FUN, and this chutney so good, my gosh. I ended up making it for Christmas gifts for friends, especially my local friends who hadn&#039;t ever experienced cranberries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, I&#039;m back in Seattle and so excited to try it again. I think I&#039;ll have to make two versions - one true to recipe and one my Japanese-twist. Thanks for this addition to my holiday staples, and for this lovely blog. I&#039;ve read it for years and write too few comments. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! I&#039;ve read your book and loved it. I tried a few recipes and they were good (specially the ratatouille!). I don&#039;t know what went wrong with this one, well I know: it&#039;s the raspberry vinegar, it overpower everything! I&#039;m not sure what I did wrong but it&#039;s a full catastrophe! &lt;br /&gt;I guess I better leave this alone; Christmas is around the corner and wont have time to experiment too much.&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;m a little disappointed but hey! Maybe next time!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the great book and I am looking forward to try some new recipes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly!  This recipe sounds delicious and I want to try it, but have a small family and am not sure how quickly it will be eaten.  Would it freeze well?  And how far in advance do you think I could make it (without having to freeze it in order to keep)?  Thanks for any guidance!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Louise, that&#039;s a good question.  Cranberries here are generally sold in 12-ounce bags, so for this recipe, you&#039;ll need 24 ounces (~700 grams).]]></description>
