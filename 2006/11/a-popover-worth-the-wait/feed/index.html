					<description><![CDATA[Foivi, if you don&#039;t have Wondra, I think I would use a different recipe.  You could certainly try all-purpose here, but I worry that it wouldn&#039;t be very good!  If I were you, I would try the Cook&#039;s Illustrated popover recipe.  I found a version of it online &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/food/articles/2008/12/24/20081224popover1224.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Hope you enjoy them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Trying your recipe as we speak. Getting popover tins in Sweden is impossible, so it&#039;s been a bit hit and miss with the muffin tins, but I never give up. I like to add a tsp or so of dijon to give them a savory flavor. We have them with dinner most often. My question is though does anyone know how The Cliff House in SF make their popovers? Been searching and searching for their recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly -- That flour, Better for Bread by Gold Medal works perfectly for making popovers.  Just as good as Wondra.  Now I can make them a lot more without running out.  Another thing, to make them even better I added some chopped onions to the mix.  They taste like onion rolls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Mare]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mary, I haven&#039;t tried this recipe with anything but Wondra, so sadly, I don&#039;t have any good information for you.  But if you try it with one of those other flours, please do let me know!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[YOU definitely made a believer out of me -- popover&#039;s are the BEST, I can&#039;t stop making them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing, is there an alternative to Wondra flour?  I like it but run out of it a lot.  I&#039;ve seen other brands of flour, like Best for Baking, etc.  Could I use that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a GREAT RECIPE]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First let me start by saying Molly your popovers look delicious!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this recipe today but mine did not rise at all. I have made yorkshire pudding in the past without any trouble. I live in Canada and we do not have wondra flour here. I looked it up on the internet,  which informed me that the same product is made by robin hood, called blending flour. Maybe they are not equivalent? Can anyone help?]]></description>
