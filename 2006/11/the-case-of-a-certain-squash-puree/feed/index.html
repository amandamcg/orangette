					<description><![CDATA[Perfect! I was in a pinch for a Thanksgiving side dish and you came through! I have a batch of the puree in my fridge right now, cooling, and my official taste-tester/husband and I both heartily approve. The flavor is beautiful.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;This is the third of your recipes that I&#039;ve tried, I think (the chewy chocolate cookies and tomato sauce were the others), and they&#039;ve all been excellent.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Can&#039;t wait for the cookbook...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I absolutely loved this squash recipe!  I am always looking for new ways to add butternut squash to my diet and this was delicious.  And I turned the leftovers in a yummy soup!  I also altered the recipe some.  You can view the results here:  http://www.cookingdebauchery.com/cooking_debauchery/2006/11/roasted_buttern.html]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m relatively new to Orangette, but you&#039;ve come highly recommended by another foodie friend...love your recipes and writing!&lt;/&gt;This sounds so good, but I admit to a strong addiction to Tom Douglas&#039; squash soup recipe (in his first cookbook). The carmelized onions adds almost as much sweetness as a syrup would. And the dollop of thyme-creme fraiche? MUST have. This as become our Thanksgiving starter course staple--even though it means I now make enough for 30. For anyone looking for another squash alternative, this is a great one, and it gets better after a day or two, so make enough for leftovers--with a fresh baguette, some fruit, and a wedge of cheese or pate, it&#039;s the perfect no-work, rainy-day comfort meal.  Cheers, all!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[Oh my goodness, I am SO going to be fired from my position as Ms. Orangette!  I&#039;ve been terribly late in responding to your comments recently, dear readers, and I apologize.  I&#039;m traveling for work this week, with spotty computer time.  Please forgive.]&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Now - phew! - that aside, Jennifer, this is &lt;&gt;perfect&lt;&gt; fare for cold, rainy nights.  Lord knows Seattle has been putting it to the test...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Maman, your daughter is one lucky girl.  Your squash sounds delicious!  And yes, microwaving it is a great trick - even though I do get irrationally scared by the possibility of the squash exploding.  I&#039;m kind of a wimp.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;s@bd, oh my, I know.  Those macaroons are completely! and! totally! addictive!  If you have to stalk me and my Orangette, I understand.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Smart question, Catherine!  I sprinkle the salt over the squash.  I&#039;ve revised the recipe instructions to make that a little more specific.  Thanks for asking!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oh &lt;&gt;yes&lt;&gt;, Nina, that sounds &lt;&gt;wonderful&lt;&gt;!  Or, hey, how about creme fraiche on top?  I&#039;ve got some in the fridge, so I might have to do a taste test...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Jen W., you and I (and my late dad) may be the only people in the world who don&#039;t turn up their noses at the thought of Cream of Wheat.  It&#039;s so sad - of all hot cereals, it seems to be the most misunderstood.  But with maple syrup and butter?  So good.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Pille!  And yes, you can most certainly use a sweet pumpkin instead.  I used to use &quot;potiron&quot; all the time when I was living in France and butternut squash wasn&#039;t easy to come by...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I heartily agree, wheresmymind!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Janice, I am just &lt;&gt;loving&lt;&gt; writing these autumnal posts - and having a good excuse to put some of my favorite holiday flavors on our regular dinner table!  Hope you liked the squash as much as we do.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Jen, quite clearly, fate is telling you to make this puree.  Go forth!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Aw, thank you, dear Luisa.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oh, Il Fornaio, I know!  Isn&#039;t that cake amazing?  Brandon and I are actually considering using it (or, rather, 30 of them) for our wedding cake.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Ann, I will most definitely have to try this with a sprinkling of mint.  Thanks for the tip!  And as for the orange juice, that would be &lt;&gt;lovely&lt;&gt;.  I would also be inclined to try replacing the water with good apple juice or cider.  Mmm.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Christianne, you&#039;ve probably already found something to do with your acorn squash - I&#039;m so late in replying! - but if not, yes, you could definitely use it here.  The only problems I can imagine are: 1) acorn squash can be hard to peel, what with its ridges and such; and 2) its flavor, to me, is a bit less full and rich and sweet than butternut squash.  I love acorn squash, but it can be hit or miss - sometimes, it just has very little flavor.  But there&#039;s no reason why you can&#039;t try it here, and a dash of maple syrup and butter can improve &lt;&gt;anything&lt;&gt;.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oooh, Tannaz, I just hopped over to your site and found your soup recipe - whooooop!  It sounds delicious.  For anyone curious, &lt; HREF=&quot;http://tannazie.blogspot.com/2006/10/big-girls-playdate.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here it is&lt;&gt;.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks, Meg!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Julie, it sounds like you had quite the college dining hall!  Mine was pretty good, but we didn&#039;t have any butternut squash puree.  Harumph.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hannah, I LOVE orange food.  Which, of course, means that I&#039;ll be making your &lt; HREF=&quot;http://the-recipe-box.blogspot.com/2006/11/soup-is-meal.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sweet potato soup&lt;&gt; asap!  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Jules, Brandon is in your camp - he wants to try this with roasted squash.  I&#039;ll bet those toasty, caramelized flavors would be dreamy here.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;It&#039;s my pleasure, Lydia!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Ah ha!  The Molly curse continues!  You can&#039;t escape me, Lia.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Great suggestions, Anastasia.  Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My Dad does something similiar except he stirs nutmeg and cinnamon in the mix. I&#039;ve also found that dark brown sugar is good if you don&#039;t have maple syrup on hand. It is a good thing to do to acorn squash, yams or sweet potates. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;It is soo good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[love the idea of maple syrup and squash...good photo with a tough subject.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m really lazy when it comes to peeling squash and usually just quarter lengthwise drizzle with olive oil and roast then scoop out the flesh and puree...heaps less work plus you get the bonus of the lovely roasted flavours]]></description>
