					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;br /&gt;I tried this recipe last night and it didn&#039;t freeze properly, despite your warning. The batter was too thin. So, I checked out some other recipes on the &#039;net and I think that the batter does need to be cooked after adding the yolks to thicken it up first. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cooked it last night and I will try the freezing again tonight]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Orangette,&lt;/&gt;What a perfect end to Valentine&#039;s Day! It was easy to quarter the recipe and the result was electric when paired with extra-sweet whipped cream and melted barely-sweet ganache. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Two tweaks that I tried: 1. Cooking the caramel longer, so the result was 50% or so darker (remind me to write down a temperature in the future). 2. Cooking the custard. There&#039;s nothing wrong with using the eggs only for flavor, but I find lightly cooked custard (to the point where the first wisps of steam are coming off) improves both flavor and texture. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you for relaying this gem of a recipe, probably the best ice cream I&#039;ve ever made, and for your enthusiasm about it.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;P.S. Have enjoyed your Bon Appétit columns as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, this is what happens when I put up a post and then leave town for Thanksgiving less than 48 hours later - it takes me two weeks to get around to replying to your wonderful comments!  My &lt;&gt;sincerest&lt;&gt; apologies.  I swear, I&#039;m going to get back on track one day.  One day.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;But to answer the pressing questions: &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Isabel, no ice cream, huh?  Let&#039;s see.  You could drizzle salted caramel over a pecan tart, or you could swirl it into some brownies, I&#039;ll bet, like David Lebovitz&#039;s &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.davidlebovitz.com/archives/2006/06/dulce_de_leche.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dulce de leche&lt;&gt;.  You could also use it as a filling for a sandwich cookie, or just smear it on a slice of baguette - &lt;&gt;yu-umm&lt;&gt;!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anali, I know, ten yolks is a LOT.  I have only tried this recipe as written here, though, so I unfortunately can&#039;t really speak to how it would be if you tweaked it to use fewer yolks.  If you play with it and have good results, please do let me know.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks so much, guys.  You&#039;re so good to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I will have to try your salted caramel icecream and also your own family&#039;s recipe for the spiced cranberries.  It will go very well with christmas ham in a few weeks. These recipes sound delicious.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Here is another caramel flavoured icecream: a crema catalana icecream that has dark praline in it.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;500ml simple cream&lt;/&gt;1 cinammon stick&lt;/&gt;grated lemon peel&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;bring these to a simmer and allow to cool and infuse.  Add a couple of drops or orange blossom water.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;beat 3 egg yolks with 65g sugar until pale and cook over low heat until coats a spoon.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;caramelize 100g sugar until dark brown (or to taste).  Allow to cool and smash into a praline.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Add half of the praline (or less if you wish a less intense caramel taste) to the custard and freeze in an icecream maker.  Mix in the remaining praline at the end.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Not the same texture, but it does remind me or real crema catalana.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;happy thanksgiving, Molly]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mmmmm. I just finished the base and I&#039;ll freeze the ice cream tomorrow morning. It will go perfectly with our apple pie. Nicole Kaplan&#039;s recipes have never let me down (we&#039;ll be serving an adaptation of her recipe for gougeres as an appetizer). I wish you, Brandon, and your families a happy thanksgiving (and the best of luck cooking your first turkey solo).]]></description>
