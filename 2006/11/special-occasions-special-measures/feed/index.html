					<description><![CDATA[AnnieKNodes, thank you!  I was pretty impressed with myself too, to tell you the truth.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Maya, I know what you mean - until now, making my own crackers always seemed silly.  But sometimes - at least in the case of this recipe, as well as other tasty-sounding ones mentioned elsewhere in these comments - it&#039;s well worth the effort.  I hope you give it a go...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Rachel, I&#039;m so glad you found my site too!  I always love to stumble upon a corner of the internet and come away with loads of inspiration.  There&#039;s a lot of it out there.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Julie, we&#039;ve been doing lots of champagne and munchies around here lately, and the black pepper version of these crackers is &lt;&gt;long&lt;&gt; gone.  I heartily endorse &#039;em.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;So funny, cookiecrumb - I think of myself as a baker, but crackers are one of the few things that I&#039;ve avoided.  But like you said, it&#039;s hard to go wrong with them - and they&#039;re so GOOD - so heck, maybe I&#039;ll be a cracker baker yet?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks, Lucette!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Yes, Amanda, pretty please, do keep me posted on your Jerusalem artichoke trials!  I meant to buy some last weekend but was distracted by all the shiny, new Brussels sprouts...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Dave, I eagerly await the results of the Frankie Cracker Challenge!  And in the meantime, have you made that kneadless baguette you mentioned on your site recently?  Inquiring minds want to know how it was...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anonymous Mama, I hope you like these!  We sure do.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Lia, your dinner party was gorgeous, from start to finish!  Now, when can I come to dinner?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The tarte was a success, though it certainly didn&#039;t look as stunning as yours! I followed your recipe for the apples but made a quick homemade crust to go with it which is usually what I do when making it the way my friend showed me. The Tokaji was delicious as well. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Take a look if you&#039;re interested (the tarte&#039;s at the bottom of the post): http://thislittlepiglet.blogspot.com/2006/11/wednesdays-dinner-and-my-first-meme.html]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there Molly, &lt;/&gt;I like them best sauteed with lemon juice, olive oil and Bragg&#039;s liquid aminos, with tarragon.  Unfortunately, that is how I like almost all foods best.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m going to try making a sunchoke-cheese soup recipe. &lt;/&gt;I will let you know how it goes.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks for the inspiration and fabulous food writing!&lt;/&gt;-amanda]]></description>
