Looking back now I feel the same pain of the &quot;missing limb sydrom&quot; .  I never made those cookies again but I come back to this post whenever I need to feel that same bittersweet feeling that , truth be told , never left me ever since .

					<description><![CDATA[I found this recipe after the City Bakery branch in Brentwood, Los Angeles shut down because I missed the cookies so much. These are perfect! I make them for Christmas parties every year and everyone raves about them and wants to know who made them. Like, people I&#039;ve never met will search the party trying to find the girl who made the chocolate cookies. They&#039;re very much worth the work. Thanks for posting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are the best cookies I have ever made and I&#039;ve made a lot of cookies!  Sadly, City Bakery has closed so at least now I have this recipe to turn to!  THANK YOU!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Although I&#039;m a huge City Bakery fan and stop there at least once a week on my neighborhood rounds, I&#039;d never tasted Maury&#039;s Melted Chocolate Chip Cookies-----until last week.  I ran home and started googling similar recipes and found yours which I made today.... although it&#039;s June in NYC,  it kinda looks like a baking day, grey and cloudy.  The cookies taste great but they don&#039;t have that  CB shiny, crackly top.  Think it&#039;s just that it&#039;s a different recipe or what else could I have done wrong?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really want to make these and envision them to be very similar to a chocolate crinkle I used to get a coffee shop which is no longer around...but I&#039;m wondering what your thoughts are on omitting the chocolate chips? I know it sounds crazy, but I kinda like my chocolate cookies (especially ones that are brownie-like) sans chips. Do you think they will be chocolatey enough? Should I add even more melted chocolate and little cocoa powder?]]></description>

That&#039;s weird, Jami! I&#039;m sorry about that. I do think they were possibly overbaked...?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these today and I wonder if I did something wrong - they were much drier than I expected. I don&#039;t think they were overbaked, but they were definitely not the soft, fudgy consistency I expected. Any thoughts? They still have a very rich, chocolate taste, though, so not a loss!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I made these with Valrhona 70% and a pound of Guittard 73% chocolate chips, and my God, was it worth it. These are nothing but chocolate. These are delicious. I have to say, thank you, and I just hope I can save some of these until Christmas.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live in Chicago, where the downtown smells like melted chocolate from the Blommer chocolate factory. It&#039;s more purely chocolatey than a bar or baked good. Something closer to brownie batter or really sludgy hot cocoa. I just made these cookies (for my boyfriend--one-year anniversary gift), and they taste like the Loop smells. AMAZING. Quite possibly the best chocolate baked good I have ever tasted. I&#039;m new to your blog as of last week, by the way. I love it, and I&#039;m going to subscribe to Gourmet.&lt;/&gt;-melissa]]></description>
