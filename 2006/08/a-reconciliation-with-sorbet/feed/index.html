					<description><![CDATA[Oh &lt;&gt;my&lt;&gt;.  Somehow all these comments slipped away from me without my noticing! Last week must have been even busier than I thought!  Sheesh.  You know how I like replying to comments, dear readers, so please forgive me for this wee delay.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tanna, I have only one thing to say: I feel for you.  I really do.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Lindy, I hope things are staying in the 75-degree range in Pittsburgh these days - but if not, long live the ice cream maker!  Your blueberry version sounds delicious.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, dear Zarah Maria!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Wheresmymind, I&#039;m sure that I&#039;ve said it before, but your wife is one smart cookie.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tony, wow - you and your great recipes!  I &lt;&gt;love&lt;&gt; marzipan, so the mere thought of &quot;almond snow&quot; has me feeling a little faint.  And then you go and tell me about the pomegranate sorbet, and the honeydew one too, the lemon with saffron!  Oh MY.  Looks like I&#039;ll be trying more &quot;Tony recipes,&quot; and happily so!  Thank you.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Well put, Ellie.  Amen to that.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You&#039;re most welcome, GoodbyeCityLife!  I hope it was a success in your kitchen.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Susan, I hear you - the blackberries are certainly reason enough to get back here as soon as possible.  Hurry!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hannah, you know, listening to your &lt; HREF=&quot;http://haeshu.blogspot.com/2006/08/in-greenwood.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;recording of the cicadas in Greenwood&lt;&gt; - I still can&#039;t believe you did that!  - actually made me feel nostalgic for them, if only for a second!  Thank you for that second.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Shari, if you ever need a dose of Northwest summer, you know who to call...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Monisha, I know what you mean - all these icy cold treats almost make me want a hot and humid summer!    Almost. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks so much for reminding me of that cookbook, Grant.  I&#039;ve been meaning to pick it up for a while now, and really, what better time?  The market is full of plums just waiting to be made into sorbet...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Natalia!  Summer is my favorite season too.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;LAA, where have you been, young lady?  Staying home with the Rama peaches, eh?  You&#039;d better get back to the mat, even if you bring along a mouthful of peaches.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, ashb - and lovely to meet you, my fellow Seattlite!  You know, I think I may have seen your wares at Velouria...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Peabody, I can only imagine what a relief Seattle summers must be to you, even if you &lt;&gt;would&lt;&gt; still like some AC.  Phew!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Too funny, Alice Q!  My grandmother  says &quot;hotter than hinges&quot; sometimes too - does yours ever use that one?  It kills me.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Dianka!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Jenjen, I&#039;ve been wanting to visit Sydney for a while now, and I&#039;ll be sure to beware of the heat.  For now, though, I hope winter isn&#039;t giving you too hard a time...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;That&#039;s the spirit, LPC!  Don&#039;t let a little cool spell stop you.  Onward with the sorbet, white peach or otherwise!  [Yours sounds wonderful, by the way.]&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Run Around Paris, I hope you do try it - and if so, please let me know what you think...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Julie, it sounds as though you have it made in the summer department - well, maybe minus that Florida humidity.  I wish Seattle had summer year-round!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;maryeats, that&#039;s amazing - and horrifying!  You need ear plugs?  Wow.  I thought Oklahoma&#039;s cicadas were loud, but you win the prize - err, if you can really call it a prize.  You know what I mean.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;bcinfrance, it sounds like you know &lt;&gt;exactly&lt;&gt; what I mean.  Hope you had a great trip!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Melissa, I have an idea: how about next summer, when you come to see your parents, Brandon and I take the ferry over and the three of us pick those blackberries and whip up something tasty?  What do you say?  &lt;&gt;Pleeeease&lt;&gt;?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Lobstersquad, oh, I wish Oklahoma were like Madrid - culture-wise, at least!  I do love my hometown, but mainly because it&#039;s my hometown, and not for much else.  Spain sounds much more my speed, although I would sort of miss Oklahoma&#039;s cowboys, chicken-fried steaks, and oil wells.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Keiko!  I hope you like the sorbet...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly - this is such a beautiful sorbet, the colour is just gorgeous! We&#039;ve got loads of blackberry trees in our allotment and have been enjoying them - I&#039;m going to try this recipe with next harvest :) Oh and happy belated anniversary too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, my dear! I probably don&#039;t need to tell you how much I agree with your assessment of PNW summers! The more places I live, the more I appreciate how rare that perfect combination of temperature, humidity and great produce actually is. It almost makes up for those eight months of rain, doesn&#039;t it? ;)&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And that sorbet, gorgeous! My parents have a huge blackberry bush outside the front door, and now I&#039;m kicking myself that I didn&#039;t do anything more with them than just pick a few on my way in and out...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh molly, I know your cicada pain! In South Korea they are so loud that it is impossible to sleep. I have ear plugs to get through the month of august. Isn&#039;t it amazing that something so small can make that much noise?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As promised here is the pomegranate and wine sorbet and also two others with fragrant compbinations.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;(1) Pomegranate sorbet&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Combine 600ml pomegranate juice, the juice of a sweet orange and 300ml of a full bodied red wine. Add to a sugar syrup made with 180g sugar and 90-120ml water.  Freeze. No one will guess the ingredients due to an exotic flavour.  Fresh pomegranate juice is easy (if potentially messy!) to make. Slice in half and juice with a citus juicer while wearing red clothes or swimming togs....&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;(2) Lemon sorbet with saffron.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;This is lemon sorbet of an extraordinary colour and a hint of the ocean. Corn syrup also in this recipe to smooth out the crystals.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Combine 1.75 cups of water with 1.5 cups sugar over heat. Add crushed saffron threads (to taste) and allow to infuse fo 5-10 minutes. Add 1.25 cups of lemon jice and 5 tablespoons of corn syrup.  Freeze.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;and last (3) Green honeydew sorbet with orange blossom water.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I was inspired to make this after having a melon salad in Spain.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Take a very ripe honeydew (green melon) blend with sugar syrup and add orange blossom water (up to half a tsp).  Freeze.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The beauty of sorbets is the subtle flavour variation that can be achieved.  Can&#039;t wait for summer!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love that deep purple color of the framboise sorbet.  I made my first sorbet three weeks ago: it was white peaches with sugar and lemon juice and zest... and yes, it was a little icy.  I&#039;ll take your advice and add corn syrup the next time it gets hot enough for a sorbet... unfortunately Paris is now under a cold spell.  :-(  It dropped to 12degC last Sat and we pulled out our jumpers.  But what the heck - there&#039;s always space for sorbet. :-)]]></description>
