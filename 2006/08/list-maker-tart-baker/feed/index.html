					<description><![CDATA[So, Molly, I downloaded this recipe from Orangette waaaaay back when you first posted it, but I finally made it for the first time yesterday for Christmas dinner.  It took allllll day.  I wasn&#039;t sure it would be worth it.  But then I made a feast - in addition to the tart, beef tenderloin, roasted cauliflower, asparagus with lemon and pecorino romano, gruyere popovers, sweet potato casserole . . . you get the drift.  And my thirteen guests were unanimous that the tart was the best dish of all.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#039;t make this often, because it was darn labor intensive, and, to be honest, I don&#039;t think that a holiday meal is the right context for it, both because its amazingness should stand on its own and because you just don&#039;t have time to make something with this many steps when you&#039;re cooking a million other treats for a big crowd.  But I will make it, oh yes I will. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hidden away the two slices that are left from the three tarts I made.  I&#039;m going to eat them for my lunch with the five stalks of asparagus that also survived the onslaught.  And no one else can have any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merry Christmas!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My Dad is a fiendish list-maker, and my parent&#039;s house is littered with his indecipherable scribbles. For the past two years, for Christmas, my mother has called a local paper store and had them make her up a foot-tall stack of plain, white notepads, which she wraps and gives to him. Last year, I believe they game them to her for free. Listmakers know--a life without a notepad is hard to keep track of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to buy the creme fraiche I&#039;ve been eyeing at the farmers market for the past two weeks, wondering what I could use it for....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Update: made it this again (the other half of the crust wasn&#039;t long for my freezer), and the result was another sunny pie to rally around. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I was in a hurry (um, even with this recipe?) and needed it to be spot on, so I didn&#039;t try the pre-peeling trick but will certainly let you know if I do.  16 lbs of the season&#039;s finest local tomatoes perched on my kitchen table almost ensure it.  Thanks, Molly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Megan, I&#039;m so glad you made it!  I just love this thing.  But as for the tomatoes, you know, I have no idea.  I can&#039;t imagine, though, that you could go wrong by peeling them first.  I say give it a go!  Will you let me know if you do?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Made it last night!  Labor-intensive - yes!  Worth it?  Yes!  The tomatoes are gorgeous. Was a little too rich for me and would make it next time with some kind of less-rich crust. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Question about the tomatoes: could you pre-peel the tomatoes whole, using the boiling water trick, then roast them, rather than stopping in the middle to peel?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Every Sunday morning my husband and I talk through our meals for the work week ahead, before we go shopping for provisions. We drool over cookbooks and saved recipes of meals gone by. The week&#039;s meal list is then stuck on our fridge door so we&#039;re always aware of what&#039;s for dinner!]]></description>
