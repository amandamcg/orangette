					<description><![CDATA[Juliann D, I haven&#039;t tried using a broiler for this, so I can&#039;t say for certain, but I think it could work.  You&#039;ll need to watch it closely, because it&#039;ll brown a lot faster than it does with the torch, but go for it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi.  Do you think I can use the broiler for this instead of a torch?  My freezer is still filled with bags of blackberries from the summer that I really need to use up, but I don&#039;t have a kitchen torch. I was thinking it would be great as part of a holiday brunch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You had loftovers of the blackberry brulee?? We can´t believe it! We prepared the recipe as you posted it. Just the two of us and a quarter of an hour later it was gone! It was so delicious we had to eat all.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The pickled onions,too, are very good, as well as the granola (really, really crunchy).&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I joined your family of readers in april just at the time you became engaged. At that time I had to stay home for 5 weeks. I red a great part of your blog then. When I´m online at home, the first thing I do is checking our blog if there is a new entry.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I´m looking forward reading the next one!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Rianta (Germany)]]></description>
