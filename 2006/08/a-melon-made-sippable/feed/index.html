					<description><![CDATA[This is the second recipe with Melon I&#039;ve seen today, must be something in the air...&lt;/&gt;I find that the perfect melon for this is Canteloupe, just the right balance of sweet/mellow.&lt;/&gt;Very refreshing, excellent recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jamie, I have a confession to make: I&#039;m not usually a big melon fan either.  Until I tasted this French Orange variety, the only type that I really found worth eating was the Charentais, which I have had only twice, both times being in Paris.  &lt;&gt;Sigh&lt;&gt;.  Otherwise, eh, not such a fan of melon.  Now, as for lemon cucumbers, of which I &lt;&gt;am&lt;&gt; quite emphatically a fan, &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.foodsubs.com/Squcuke.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;&gt; is some information.  For one thing, they are quite pretty to look at, but more importantly, they are wonderfully crunchy and sweet.  Very, very summery.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Yup, Natalia, it tastes very much like cantaloupe.  Imagine the flavor of the best cantaloupe you&#039;ve ever tasted, and then imagine that flavor cranked up a couple of levels, so that it&#039;s sweeter, juicier, and more vibrant.  &lt;&gt;That&lt;&gt; is a French Orange.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Aw, thank you, Alice Q!  This would be delicious with champagne, I&#039;ll bet.  Good thinking.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;MonkeyLover, if you do give it a try with rum, please report back.  Inquiring minds want to know...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Dianka, every now and then, I too wish I were European, especially when I see or read or hear anything having to do with George Bush.  [Shudder.]  But as for American melons, I don&#039;t know - this one is awfully good... &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oooh, Janice, melon gelato?  That sounds &lt;&gt;wonderful&lt;&gt;.  I might have to try that at home before the season is through.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Delaleuverses!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Leslie, that &lt;&gt;is&lt;&gt; a toughie!  Hmm.  Can we call it a tie?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My mom used to make a refreshing canteloupe drink when I was a kid; this sounds like such a fun adult version! &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I should have brought a French melon back with me from Paris; the melon gelato there was practically the thing itself. Amazing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder how it would be with champagne - kind of like a bellini I imagine?  What a great idea, and a great post too! I love it when new entries pop up on my feed reader!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m like you, the drink is secondary to the meal.  I just about always have a glass of water.  But this melon drink seems worth trying.  I&#039;ve never had orange melon, does it taste like cantaloupe?]]></description>
