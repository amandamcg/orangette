					<description><![CDATA[Anonymous, I apologize for not replying sooner!  I&#039;ve never made this soup ahead of time, to be honest, so I&#039;m not sure how it would keep. But if I were you, I would try it.  I&#039;ll bet it would be just fine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Almost four years after your original post, and it&#039;s 101 degrees in New York City.   Googling chilled soups I ended up on your site, and just finished a wonderful cool bowl.   The lime/ginger zing is just perfect.  Will be making this again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just have to ask. Is that an abused-into-complete-submission turquoise pyrex bowl? It&#039;s an uncanny semblance but I can&#039;t imagine how the bowl got to that state!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah well, Miz Hatbox, as you said, that just means more soup for you!  It sounds as though you have a winning plan for next time, though, what with that sneaky smoothie title.  [Unless, of course, you want to keep calling it soup so you can hoard it for yourself!]  As for avocados in smoothies in general, it sounds like pure genius.  Along those lines, have you seen &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.travelerslunchbox.com/journal/2006/5/31/the-secret-life-of-avocados.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;&gt;?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It was fantastic, though apparently I am the only one in the family who thinks so. My husband feels as you do about cold soups, my daughter doesn&#039;t like carrot juice, Mom doesn&#039;t care for avocado, and on and on. Oh well, more for me. :-)&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;But...hmmm... I bet if I left out the diced avocado and served the ginger/lime/pureed avocado/carrot juice in glasses and called it a &quot;gingered carrot smoothie&quot;, I bet it would go over much bigger. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Come to think of it, I&#039;ve been looking for some way to add a little more creamy bulk to smoothies without resorting to ice cream...and I&#039;ve been looking for something to do with all those avocados that come in my Root Connection share... OMG! Avocados in smoothies! I will have to try that! (when the family isn&#039;t looking, of course)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, how was the soup, Miz Hatbox?  I hope you liked it.  And as for your salsa-by-the-spoon stance, I know what you mean - salsa is certainly tasty enough to be eaten on its own, with a spoon or otherwise.  For me, though, it just doesn&#039;t quite do the trick.  I&#039;m one of those who is awfully fond of the chip part of the equation, so for as much as I love salsa, I want the chips to go with!]]></description>
