					<description><![CDATA[If I double the recipe, should I use two ham bones or one?  This is one of our favorite soups ever.  I plan on serving a army on New Years day, and want to make sure I have some leftovers :)

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was wondering, Molly (or anyone who has made this), about how much bacon fat renders from the 4 strips of bacon?  I keep a jar of bacon fat in my fridge, and I figured I might as well just use it for this, but I&#039;m not sure how much I should use.  A tablespoon, maybe?  ]]></description>
