					<description><![CDATA[Thinking...

I&#039;d like to roast my butternut squash on the Kamado, then use it to make the soup. to prepare for the grill, I peel off the sticker and toss it over the fire.  I figure that the extra and unique flavor of the smoked squash will more than offset any loss of flavor by not cooking the raw squash within the soup.  Another revelation is that I no longer have to deal with peeking the wretched shell.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Was looking for something to do with some cut-up butternut squash this weekend and found this recipe - lucky break! It is downright delicious and only gets better with reheating. I had a bit of spare broccoli in the fridge so I threw that in too, and it gave it a nice extra bit of texture and flavor. I&#039;m vegetarian so I replaced the fish sauce with soy sauce and it was a little under salted in the end, so if you make the same substitution I&#039;d recommend upping the soy sauce to 2-3 tbs at least. Otherwise really fantastic and I will definitely be making it again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ooh yum, so glad I found this recipe (and your blog!) yesterday. I had roasted a squash a few days ago and made the soup as per your recipe using some broth from my Thanksgiving turkey soup-in-the-making. Added a bit of ginger and the soup made a wonderful meal. Soooo good. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is my go to squash soup. I love that most if the ingredients are kitchen staples. I use a red kuri squash and it is so fabulous. I don&#039;t like spicy but I would not omit the sriracha (or fish sauce- it adds salt and umami). It&#039;s such a small amount and really makes the flavor profile of this soup. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the recipe, I left out the fish sauce and Sriracha (didn&#039;t have any) but added a sweet potato and ginger from a similar recipe.. tons of compliments. Also baked the squash (acorn) and sweet potato first, so I didn&#039;t have to peel:) &lt;br /&gt;My sister cooks squash ahead and has it in the fridge to use on demand.. good for baby food too..&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again]]></description>
