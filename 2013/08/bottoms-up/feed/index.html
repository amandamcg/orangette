					<description><![CDATA[The mention of summer romance struck a note with me. I was about to say I never had a summer romance - but I realize that I had several, one I will never forget.  It was in a book I read called SEVENTEENTH SUMMER  and,  while I was reading it, I was the heroine.  I still feel like I lived that summer.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a few summers when I had a boyfriend,  and we did summery things together, but no big romance. My big romance happened in the fall, and another in the winter. But the most vivid one was Seventeenth Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LindaC]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a huge fan (have lost track of the number of copies of A Homemade Life I&#039;ve bought as gifts), and was excited today to see you talking both about gardening and keeping track of what makes you happy.  I hope it&#039;s not too presumptuous, but, working from a comment you made in your FAQs, am enclosing a link to my blog about &quot;middle ground&quot; gardening, because the most recent post talks about exactly that--what makes us happy! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://middlegroundgardening.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your blog makes me so happy--so glad I can now read you in two different places, and will look forward to the Food52 column!]]></description>
