					<description><![CDATA[Hello! I just found and made this recipe. It got too hot! Maybe a toaster oven wasn&#039;t the best idea for this recipe. I&#039;m left with some probably-too-soft apricots (i bet they&#039;ll still be good), but practically no syrup! (and a dish thats going to need a long soak before a scrub). Any advice? Mil gracias!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, I just wanted to pop in and tell you that I am a loyal reader in Germany, and I was in Seattle a couple of weeks ago and decided to go check out Delancey and Essex. Super impressed! You guys have really done a great job there. My favorite was the pizza with the fennel sausage... sooo so good. I&#039;ll definitely be returning next time I am in Seattle.]]></description>
