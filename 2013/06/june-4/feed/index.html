					<description><![CDATA[Molly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to say how happy I am for you, and Brandon, and how lucky little June is!  I still remember, years ago, when Brandon came to visit me (while I was living in Denver) on his way out west to meet the girl whose blog he was so taken with.  That you two have found such a beautiful love and created such a marvelous life fills my heart with joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love to you all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I just finished reading your book and I loved it. It has made my Christmas present list quite easy. I have already made the corn cakes and the chocolate cake and they were a great success. My son and his family live on Vashon Island so I have forwarded them the info on Delancy and hope to visit myself soon when I come out for a time. Now I have searched your blog and discovered June and she is adorable!!! Good luck to you and I hope you have a &quot;proper&quot; oven by now!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is another nod for the food approach, wise mama :-) Both my girls (9 &amp; 7 now) were fed the same way and they now sit and eat what is available when they are hungry. They love our home cooking (lots of plants!) and appreciate meals made for them when they are guests, even if it means trying a new thing. My youngest one barely touched anything till 13 months when she reached into my salad with her pudgy hand, pulled out a handful and stuffed it in, chewing happily. We have never catered to &#039;individual&#039; meals during family meal times and it has never been a problem. Of course there are favorites, but don&#039;t we all have favorites. I&#039;ll take cake!]]></description>
