					<description><![CDATA[I never thought the day would come that I was grateful for having run out of mayonnaise but today is that day.  Pulled out pasta, peas and Tina to make a little salad for lunch but realized I was out of mayo.  Try as I might, I don&#039;t like my homemade mayo as well as Helman&#039;s (I know, I know).  Then angels sang and I remembered this recipe and I will now probably never make tuna salad again, or any other pasta, at least not for a long, long time.  I used some whole milk (homemade) kefir (not even strained to a yogurty thickness), Parmesan instead of feta, and not enough basil but it was magnificent.  Next time I&#039;ll use feta because I know it will be delicious, though the Parmesan was delicious too.  The chili oil and pine nuts make it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[FWIW, if you decide to use farro instead, go with 1.5 cups.  I soaked mine for 8 hrs, then prepared it as described.  Delish!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know what has taken me so long to make this... but I whipped it together with my 8 week old moby-wrapped to me. It tastes like spring in a bowl (which is saying something in the dead of this snowy and cold Wisconsin winter). In conclusion -- you DID tell me so. Thanks, Molly! And -- have you made his green couscous? That is what we call a herb-y hug. :)]]></description>
