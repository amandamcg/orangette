					<description><![CDATA[My favourite line from this wonderful post:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;June, the child I had no idea I even wanted to have, back when I took this photo!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#039;t it amazing how all we do is put one foot in front of the other, and keep moving forward, with absolutely no idea how it will all turn out? Or who might enter our lives? Life can be so heartbreakingly beautiful.]]></description>

<p>&#8220;June, the child I had no idea I even wanted to have, back when I took this photo!&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t it amazing how all we do is put one foot in front of the other, and keep moving forward, with absolutely no idea how it will all turn out? Or who might enter our lives? Life can be so heartbreakingly beautiful.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I always look forward to a new post, and even though I am not a mother, I can relate.&lt;br /&gt;This one has really gotten to me, as I cannot stop thinking about the elderly woman who sent you the cake.   I know you were terribly busy, but I am so sad that you didn&#039;t walk across the street and thank her personally, even though you heard she was shy.   All too often we become so caught up in the hectic nature of our lives, forgetting that it all comes down to that cake.   What a generous gift!   Imagine her thinking about it, and taking the time to bake it... a gesture people seem to have long forgotten.   It means so much!  It looks like a cake my mother would have baked.   I agree with the person who said, if you can, to find a way to visit her, and return the gift.  It would mean the world to her, this I know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this post. What a fun little trek down memory lane. Four years this summer, right? I remember scraping the bit of rust off the refrigerator shelves and just so happy to be doing something to help, however small it was. And (nearly) four years later we&#039;re still enjoying that delicious pie down the street. ]]></description>
