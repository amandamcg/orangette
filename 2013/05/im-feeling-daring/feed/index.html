					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have a stand mixer but I do have a nutra ninja. Is it possible to mix the ingredients with that. If not can I mix it by hand. Also can you add any other flavors to this recipe such as almond or vanilla extract without jeopardizing the flavor.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to say that this cake is in regular rotation here and we like it a lot. So far I haven&#039;t scribbled the ingredient list down somewhere but come back to read your post each time. So: Hi there again! :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny - I made this tonight, forgetting entirely that you&#039;d baked it up last year. I&#039;m eating it right now and find it every bit as delicious as you&#039;ve said, but I had a little trouble with it browning too fast at the edges and undercooking in the middle. We&#039;re in this new house of course and I suspect the oven is running a bit hot; anyway, I got online to see if anyone else had had similar trouble. Came across your post. And the most important bit is this: &quot;...stash them away for future occasions that demand sweets on short notice.&quot; I think I have one of those coming up in about three weeks, give or take a couple, and I am going to try very hard to stash the second loaf as an immediate post-baby treat. Yes yes?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found your blog after seeing you in Saveur and realizing that the lovely Pasquini in the photo used to sit in my kitchen until I got married and my hubby wanted to exchange it or a super automatic.  Love your food blog and glad you figured out the machine!  I&#039;m happy it found a good home, it is way to pretty to sit on a shelf :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to seeing what you come up with next!]]></description>
