					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a new comer to your blog but wish I&#039;d been here from the start. I love your writing. &lt;br /&gt;Yesterday your book arrived; a beautiful, pristine copy which I was lucky to find here in the UK. I have been reading nearly all day, delighting in every chapter and recipe. My mouth has been watering as I read. I want to make everything that I&#039;ve seen so far(well except for the prunes!), potato salad, pound cake, hoosier pie, cupcakes and the rest - all are going to come out of my kitchen sometime soon. All I have to do is remind myself of a few conversions from American to English and I will start cooking. Thanks, Molly, for writing such an inspiring book. ]]></description>
