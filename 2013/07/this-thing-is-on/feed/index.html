					<description><![CDATA[This looks amazing!  I am thrilled for you and cannot wait to pick up a copy.  I&#039;m launching into a writing project myself (of the less interesting academic sort- exciting nevertheless) and would LOVE advise on the process.  The advise I took away from this post?  Buy peanut butter.  Keep said peanut butter as well as various bread-like items on hand!  Thanks for the inspiration both from your last book, the pending book and of the culinary sort!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was just at the restaurant on Sunday night and propped my pinhole camera on the bar to capture Brandon making fabulous pizzas with a 30 minute exposure on film. If all turns out well I&#039;ll send you the photo. &lt;br /&gt;Love the restaurant and can&#039;t wait to get a copy of your new book as I loved the first one.]]></description>
