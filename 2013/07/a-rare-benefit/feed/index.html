					<description><![CDATA[This is excellent!  I used sweetened coconut, so reduced the sugar -- only 1/3C in the crust &amp; only 1/4C in the filling -- just right with apricots, which needed a little sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#039;t wait to try it with other fruits &amp; also with part buckwheat (I used white wholewheat flour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks for such a lovely dessert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m planning on making this today! I&#039;m feeling pretty darn excited about it. I have a few peaches I&#039;m going to use, and might also include some roasted rhubarb. Now the question is, do I use the whipping cream in the fridge to make whipped cream to top this, or save it to top something else this weekend....?? Life&#039;s tough questions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had to pop by and share that I made this last week. I actually have SNED, but it was your post that brought my eyes to the recipe again. This tart will now be a standby for me. (I almost always have coconut in my house because of your granola recipes!) It&#039;s so easy and so freakin&#039; delicious. I used 1/2 cup graham flour along with ww, blackberries &amp; apricots for the fruit. Pistachios topping it off were icing on the cake- I loved them. Thanks, Molly! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently swapped a bit of coconut oil for butter and/or vegetable oil in my favourite pie crust and the results had people begging me to quit my job and open a bakery. That won&#039;t happen, but I appreciated the compliment, so I thought I&#039;d pass it along -- considering that you have coconut in the crust anyway ;) Enjoy!]]></description>
