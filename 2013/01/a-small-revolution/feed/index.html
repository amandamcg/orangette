					<description><![CDATA[I knew I could fulfill my Effies Oatcake addiction for less than $6 for a small pack and here we have a winner! I truly scoured the internet for a suitable recipe. I loved these! I didn&#039;t bother cutting them out, just spread them with my fingers on a lined parchment paper and cut a grid into them before baking, they snapped apart nice and easy afterward and I didn&#039;t have to bake twice. Made myself a cheese plate for dinner afterward (like the opposite of a salad). Deeeelicious.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this post! I have been looking for an oakcake recipe! I just made a batch. Literally still cooling, but of course I had to have a nibble. YUM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I added dried apricots for a little tangy-ness. Also, in an attempt to cook a on the healthy side, I used coconut oil instead of butter and dark brown sugar. Because the coconut oil isn&#039;t as moist as the butter I had to use 6 oz. of yogurt. I would suggest taking them out about 5 minutes earlier if you plan to do the same. That is the awesome thing about oakcakes they can be open to adaptations. Thank you again! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;I just made these oatcakes for the millionth time since you posted the recipe.  This time, I used 50% rye flour and 50% whole wheat...and just like your rye crumble recipe, the nutty flavor of the rye flour made them even more unbelievable!  Yum!!!]]></description>
