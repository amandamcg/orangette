					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your sharing this generously Molly. not many would face it and talk about it here. I was reading ‘a homemade life’ two days ago while commute home from work. so here I am today reading this post of yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could relate a lot, I met my husband via email, we have a 8mo now. I suffered PPD the first three months due to a colicky baby and dealing with the toughest task of running and manning a ‘milk factory’ right after birth. I must admit the milk pumping at wee hours makes things tougher, dusky and lonely. I am thankful now - people and the proverb are right ‘after the storm comes the sunshine’. I am glad I found this post of yours and Well Done Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just want you to know that I read this, originally back when you posted it, and my heart went out to you.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I had my second son, and what do you know: I lived it, too. And when I was going through it, this post of yours kept popping up from my memory banks, and it really did bring me comfort.  No one talks about it, you&#039;re right.  We should. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I was Pinning your creamy beans recipe, and made a point today to go back and seek out this post so that I can say: Thank you, so much. Not only for sharing great recipes and your lovely stories, but for this post in particular.  It made me feel not quite so awful and horrid because of the horrible feelings I had post-partum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had not checked in on you for a while.  So, reading this morning I was sad to read what you are experiencing/or experienced by this point.  When I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, one of the other surgeries I needed was to have my ovaries removed.  After this surgery, I experienced something very similar.  Again, the abrupt disruption of hormones contributed to the development of depression.  I too, had the same experience of having something that I did not immediately see as depression.  I was overwhelmed.  Fortunately, I had experience with depression and a great cancer team who helped me toward medication and better days.  Your post pulled at my heart strings and I wanted your to know that I wish you well as you recover and with your treasured little one!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I see that you have already had such wonderful response, but i would like to share my experience as well.  I had (undiagnosed) post-partum with my first child, and I remember feeling so alone.  I don&#039;t need to explain the feeling to you, I know, but I do now share my experience with any expectant mother who I am close enough to share it with - not to scare them off, but to let them know that they are not alone, no matter how it may feel.&lt;br /&gt;talking about it always helps.  I was so afraid of having postpartum the second time around that I nearly had anxiety attacks right after my son was born, until I realized that I had the tools to confront and handle it if it did happen...and then it dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;thank you for your honest words, and your little June is so very dear!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My God, what a beautiful baby.  Thank you for having the courage to share your story.  Sharing our stories brings us women together and reminds us that we are not alone in our journeys, which are wonderful and messy and sometimes difficult.  Best wishes to you, and I promise, you will return to your normal self again. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just read this and was completely caught off guard because I am the happiest I have ever been in my life and had somehow forgotten that a year and a half ago my postpartum depression was so bad I wanted to die. It gets better, then better and so much better. I don&#039;t even know how the fog lifted, but I imagine it was some time around the time I got to sleep again. Only then was coping possible. Nothing can prepare you for the utter exhaustion that comes with a new baby and feelings of loss of self. Much love from Vancouver. ]]></description>
