					<description><![CDATA[you asked about our greatest hits and I must say that your (brandon&#039;s) recipe for chana masala has been in constant rotation for years now. I am currently traveling the country in my car (with a small box of spices and kitchen items) and staying with friends or friends of friends or sometimes new friends and when in doubt I know I can feed/impress any crowd with your trusty standard. this in addition to an exceptional Kale salad and an ever changing chickpea tuna salad I can make with whatever is fresh and on hand and practically with my eyes closed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must also thank you for so many years of delicious and inspiring writing, beautiful photographs and sharing. I have been a fan for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;a million thank yous from me and all my happily fed friends.&lt;br /&gt;l i z a&lt;br /&gt;longroadbeautiful.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m incredibly late to the party but when my garden gives me an excess of zucchini (and in reality, when does it not?) one of the things I do is cook it like a potato until it&#039;s tender, slice it in half, scoop out most of the center (leave about 1/4 inch) and then?  In a pan with some olive oil or butter, take the zuch insides and saute it with diced tomatoes, sliced mushrooms, onions and some garlic, when everything is &quot;soft&quot; toss it with the breadcrumbs of your choice, salt, pepper (or whatever you like) some freshly grated parm and refill those zuch shells.  Top with buttered breadcrumbs and a touch of your choice of cheese and bake until the cheese is melty and the &quot;crumbs&quot; are golden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the many ways a southerner gets &quot;rid&quot; of their zucchini!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  Love your site, a (very) long time lurker.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve made this dish twice in the last two weeks, and it&#039;s just fabulous! I used a soft goat cheese instead, and it works beautifully! My husband said that this was the best zucchini he&#039;d ever had! Thanks, Molly!]]></description>
