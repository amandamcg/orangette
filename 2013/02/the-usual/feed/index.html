					<description><![CDATA[I finally got around to making this on Easter, and the only thing I am sad about is that it took me so long to try out this salad out.  I&#039;ve been missing out for a whole year, what a waste!  I was skeptical about the Asian style dressing with farro and feta, but it works perfectly.  Doubled it and have eaten it every day this week.  And looking forward to it again today.  Thank you, thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A peeve of mine is that blog comments are usually not made after making a recipe, just whether or not it sounds good. What help is that? So, here&#039;s a comment post-dinner... I&#039;m terrible at following a recipe, because I like my own spin on things. So, thanks for the encouragement to elaborate with this recipe! We had it tonight, and it was super yum. I put washed and chopped kale in the bottom of my bowl; quite a bit actually. Then I fried up some Chinese sausage &amp; dumped that on. When the farro was ready, I dumped it hot from the strainer onto the waiting greens &amp; let it set awhile to wilt a bit while I chopped green onion, carrot, mint, cilantro &amp; Thai basil.  Then to dump the dressing on and toss. Very good, Molly, you never disappoint!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Read it, tried it, and loved it. It is just amazing how food can reach so many people without uttering a single syllable just on the basis of its flavors. Can&#039;t wait to get my hands on your new book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW your baby is like a acme of cuteness.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>
