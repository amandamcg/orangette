					<description><![CDATA[in my opinion, spiced nuts are the best part of Christmas goodies!

					<description><![CDATA[Yum! I made spiced nuts once from Mark Bittman&#039;s recipe from How to Cook Everything, and can&#039;t remember why I didn&#039;t revisit the recipe. (Though I do have a bit of a repressed memory involving me dumping said candied nuts all over the floor and having to toss them because...cat hair. Seriously scarring.) Thank you for the inspiration to try again, this time with a bit of heat added in the mix. We&#039;ve got some fresh pecans and a few cashews that might be just the ticket for this recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post isn&#039;t about nuts. I just wanted to tell you that I love the beginnings of new months. That&#039;s because I come to your blog and select at random the same month from a previous year and read what you were doing, and remember where I was living and with whom I ate whatever recipe I&#039;ve made from that page. I remember the mood I was in and the way your stories enhanced it or changed it in whatever perfect way. I think about seasons, and traditions, and life&#039;s developments. I get all sentimental about the internet, something I claim to be unsentimental about. So thank you for writing and cooking and caring  about the small things. It makes a difference.]]></description>
