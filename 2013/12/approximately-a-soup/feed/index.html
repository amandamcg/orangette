					<description><![CDATA[I made this soup yesterday and I added maybe a half a cup of beer to the shredded cabbage and cooked it until it was entirely absorbed then I carried on with the rest of the ingredients. Will see how it turned out today as I believe soup always tastes better the second day!  It&#039;s raining here and a bowl of soup sounds fantastic for dinner!  Stay warm !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used equal measures of farro because I was out of Arborio rice and it turned out great. If you have Parmesan broth kicking around in your freezer like I did, this is a great way to use it. Super delicious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to thank you for bringing us this amazing recipe. We&#039;ve made it 3 times in 3 weeks, and I keep hoping to stash some in the freezer but the pot is emptied every time. When our cabbage didn&#039;t look like enough for our appetites, we added kale and brussel sprouts, and they were delicious, too. To increase the health, we subbed brown rice for the arborio and the long slow cooking worked it&#039;s wonders and broke it down to a creamy consistency. For a vegan version, we skipped the cheese and added a splash of truffle oil on top of each serving. AMAZING! Thank you!]]></description>
