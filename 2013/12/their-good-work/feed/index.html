					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to add that while Kenji can no longer fill orders by Christmastime on Etsy for those stellar aprons, you can still find a few men&#039;s and women&#039;s in the ID at MOMO (if you happen to live in Seattle, that is). Also, Molly, I&#039;m having the hardest time getting a certificate from Buvette! The website store seems glitchy and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll never get anyone to answer the phone. I&#039;d like one for a dear sweet french foodie friend who lives in NY. She just had a dreadful breakup and I know she&#039;d love this place. Any tips??]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This isn&#039;t a comment about this post in particular, I just wanted to say, though, that your recipes never fail me.  Whenever I want something delicious and comforting, I turn to your archive.  I made your split pea soup this evening, and that cabbage soup is on my list.  Thank you for putting your stories and recipes out there for all of us.  ]]></description>
