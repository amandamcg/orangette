					<description><![CDATA[So... just found your blog.  LOVE IT!  I was just reading an excerpt of your intro to my husband, who is patient waiting for me to start this oatmeal (which I am SO excited about!).  The part about the splinter, your mom not liking your bangs (I suspect my mom is hiding the same truth) you being an inspiration for Katy Perry&#039;s lyrics... we laugh and I exclaim, &quot;I freaking LOVE this woman!  From the new blog I found..&quot;.  He says &quot;So Smitten Kitchen is a thing of the past?&quot;  Me: &quot;OH NO!  Im sure they are all friends&quot;.  Oh Deb and Molly... you know... all friends :).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you! We&#039;re expecting our first baby this July, and anticipating a cross country move (the second in a year!) a few weeks after our son is born, and your writing is so helpful and beautiful. As it&#039;s always been. Can&#039;t wait for your book - your first book is currently oil-stained from its use among my other cookbooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried making this in a vegan fashion, substituting soy milk and 2 overripe bananas, pureed, for the milk. I think that the whole milk version will probably be best. Does anyone have any other vegan substitutes for us?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We LOVED this. I&#039;ve tried Heidi&#039;s version, but didn&#039;t like the bananas at the bottom of the pan. We made one and a half batches for a 9x13 pan, which needed just 35 minutes to cook. My boyfriend said it was the best breakfast ever!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I forgot to add the blueberries, and added them after, and this still tasted great! My two little ones gobbled it up. I will be making it again - with all the ingredients this time. Thanks!]]></description>
