					<description><![CDATA[I have been feeling down lately . Too emotional and nostalgic, the deadly combo   . I woke up with a headache and not too much energy to go through the day.  As I was putting on my slippers I remembered this recipe that for some reason  I haven&#039;t tried yet ! I happened to have pears patiently waiting to be used  and carob molasses to make brown sugar . Clafouti,  I hope you are as good as promised!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Discovered this recipe a couple of years ago when we had a couple of ripe local pears . Probably have made it at least a dozen times - pears had been Usually eaten raw and not baked with in my experience.   Any how it  hit all  our buttons  and  even used it with peaches and purple plums.   The brown sugar makes the difference !  Thank you.   P.S.  just learned that pears ripen  from the inside to the outside.  Young can teach an old dog (70+) new tricks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Made this with strawberries from the garden today and accidentally doubled the amount of milk. At first I panicked that it would never set, then decided to give it some extra time in the oven and see what happens. I ended up baking for another 20 minutes and while the end result is more custard than clafoutis, it is still delectable!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I had 2 Bosc pears to use up and googled recipes for an hour then finally remembered you had a pear dessert a few yeats back. I used dark brown sugar and 2 smaller Bosc pears. When I popped it in the oven I realized that I had tasted my first pear clafoutis a few weeks ago. My mom&#039;s boss is French and his French wife made my mom some. Needless to say, I was not impressed and couldnt eat more than a bite with the French ladys Clafoutis...it was boring. So, when I took a bite of mine today, I was not expecting to be impressed but knew my family would eat it. Let me just say, I was entirely impressed and won over by your recipe! It was entirely custardy, brown sugary delicious and I am trying not to have a 3rd slice!!!! THANK YOU!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Made three of these over the weekend for various events. Found that I needed to increase the cooking time quite a bit, although I have an oven thermometer so I&#039;m pretty sure it was accurate. Also, for the second two I briefly poached the pears in white wine, sugar, cinnamon, etc. This helped the pears be more the consistency of the clafoutis, so more coherent and easier to eat and cut. Such a lovely idea and recipe, all three were hits!]]></description>
