					<description><![CDATA[<p>Helloooooooooooooooo. I didn&#8217;t mean to be gone for so long. I know what some of you were thinking, and I am delighted to report that I did not give up on blogging. I also did not die. But it&#8217;s been a long, hard, dizzying summer, I will say that, with, among other things, Herculean staffing woes at Delancey, Essex, and Dino&#8217;s. (Did you know there&#8217;s currently a shortage of restaurant cooks in a lot of cities, including Seattle? I could tell you stories.) But now that June is in school again, I&#8217;ve been able to tiptoe my way back to writing, and that&#8217;s a relief. I turned 38 last week, and that too feels good. I&#8217;ve also been cooking again, after the lazy, happy ease&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>On the night we got there, when we checked in, the lady at the front desk wrote out the wifi network and password on the corner of a pad of paper, ripped it free, and handed it to me. I slid it into my phone case, so that I wouldn&#8217;t lose it, and last week, three months later, I noticed it still wedged there. &#8220;How&#8217;s that Rancho Pescadero wifi working for you?&#8221; Brandon says, peering over my shoulder. &#8220;Little slow, from 2,000 miles away?&#8221; I roll my eyes, yank out the scrap of paper, and crumple it up. But when he looks away, I press it flat again and slip it back in. I first heard about Rancho Pescadero was from a couple of Delancey neighbors and longtime&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, I got up earlier than usual, while the light was still blue, and baked a cake. We are having a very adult fall &#8211; not adult in the sense of, I don&#8217;t know, the adult film industry, but in the sense that we now have a child who is enrolled in a real school. I remember only bits and pieces of my own first year of school, but I do remember operating under the happy illusion that my parents were bonafide adults who had things figured out. Having now crossed over to the other side of that illusion, I can report that, whoa, hey, it&#8217;s an illusion! June is no fool, but she&#8217;s content to play along as&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Two Mondays ago, the night before the moving truck was due to arrive at my mother&#8217;s new (Seattle!) house with everything she owns, Brandon suggested making a celebratory dinner. My mother, it was agreed, would choose the menu. After a moment&#8217;s hesitation, she requested steak and Caesar salad. We headed out for groceries. I&#8217;m not going to go into great depth about the steak. I don&#8217;t know. I feel bored just thinking about writing it. You know how to cook steak. Right? You don&#8217;t need me. If you don&#8217;t know how, or if you want to try another method, I can tell you that we use Renee Erickson&#8217;s instructions (for indoor cooking, not grilling) on page 195-196 of her dreamy&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Happy Two Days After Valentine’s Day! I hope you celebrated in style, which is more than we did. I typed most of this post on Valentine’s night, while Brandon worked at Delancey, slinging pizzas for all the lovers.  I did, however, rally to bake a banana bread.  Nothing says, I love you (or, You married your grandmother), like a banana bread on Valentine’s Day. This is not a post about banana bread, just to clarify. This is a post about lime curd.  Not lemon curd, but lime: &#8220;the superlative citrus,&#8221; as our friend Niah, who is also the bar manager of Essex, likes to say. And if it seems like I only post sweets and baked goods anymore, I know, I know,&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, I think it was, one of you kindly wrote to me, asking if I might do a post about what I’ve been eating for lunch lately. The reader who wrote to me is pregnant, and there are a number of foods that us pregnant ladies are told to avoid, making quick, easy lunches hard to come by: no deli meats, no (uncooked) cured meats, no high-mercury fish (tuna, for example), no cheeses of certain types, and so on. I am going to spare you, however, a post on what I’ve been eating at my desk lately, because my lunches are about as riveting as C-SPAN. The post would go something like this: nut butter sandwich, carrots, tangerine,&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Okay. This year, I’ve decided, is going to be the year of The Breakfast Book. I’m allergic to resolutions, so let’s not use that word. Let’s just say that if I do nothing else in 2011, I would like to spend more time with one of the worthiest books on my shelf, one that has never done me wrong, one authored by she of the famous yeasted waffle, the esteemed Ms. Marion Cunningham. There is no one I trust more on the matter of breakfast. There is also no one else that I know of who has managed to wedge a treatise on manners into a chapter on quick breads. Witness a selection from “Breakfast Table Civility and Deportment” (page&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>About a million years ago, by which I mean last Thanksgiving, I mentioned on Twitter that my cousins had made an olive oil cake for our mothers’ birthday dinner. Our mothers are identical twins, born in the third week of November, which means that our family’s Thanksgiving comes with an extra bonus meal: The Twins’ Birthday. Anyway, I mentioned this cake, and someone &#8211; maybe one of you reading today? &#8211; asked if I might share the recipe. I said that I would do my best to get it from my cousin Katie, its keeper, which I did, and after bringing it home and accidentally burying it in a stack of papers on my desk for three months, which I’m&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to report that we are finally approaching the part of this restaurant thing when we actually get to cook. It’s kind of amazing. The construction is essentially done. There are some details left to complete, like installing acoustic paneling (to cut down on noise), hanging art and mirrors, and setting up the computer system, but we’re very close. Two of our construction workers &#8211; I’m not going to say who (rhymes with “Holly” and “Mandon”) &#8211; accidentally glued an eight-foot-tall chalkboard to the floor on Sunday, but it’s okay. It came up easily enough. We’re really very close. And we still seem to remember how to cook, which is promising, since that’s the whole point. About ten&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>About five years ago, I think it was, I went out to dinner with my friend Keaton and ate something called sauce gribiche. I had never heard of it before, but it was a kind of coarse vinaigrette, with chopped cornichons and capers and hard-boiled eggs, and it was served over asparagus. I don’t know why I remember it so clearly, aside from the fact that I dripped some of it onto my pants, but ever since, I’ve thought about it sometimes, usually when I’m supposed to be thinking about more important things, and I’ve wanted to try making it. It took me a while, as you can see, but yesterday, I finally did. Twice. The thing is, as I&#8230;</p>
