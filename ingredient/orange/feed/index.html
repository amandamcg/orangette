					<description><![CDATA[<p>Today is our eighth wedding anniversary. It&#8217;s also the 11th birthday of this blog, the first day of our first-ever corporate tax audit, and the day that my mother officially moves to Seattle. It&#8217;s a lot of Big Adult Stuff, and I have lots of feelings, including immense gratitude for our accountant. But most of all, I&#8217;m glad that these two wide-eyed pups, the ones in this shot circa 2007, decided to take the great leap that is marriage, that they&#8217;ve kept at it, showing up, cooking, eating, building, building some more, figuring it out, duking it out, and loving, loving, for eight whole years. And I&#8217;m glad that this blog made it all happen. Thanks for being along for&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, I think it was, one of you kindly wrote to me, asking if I might do a post about what I’ve been eating for lunch lately. The reader who wrote to me is pregnant, and there are a number of foods that us pregnant ladies are told to avoid, making quick, easy lunches hard to come by: no deli meats, no (uncooked) cured meats, no high-mercury fish (tuna, for example), no cheeses of certain types, and so on. I am going to spare you, however, a post on what I’ve been eating at my desk lately, because my lunches are about as riveting as C-SPAN. The post would go something like this: nut butter sandwich, carrots, tangerine,&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>About a million years ago, by which I mean last Thanksgiving, I mentioned on Twitter that my cousins had made an olive oil cake for our mothers’ birthday dinner. Our mothers are identical twins, born in the third week of November, which means that our family’s Thanksgiving comes with an extra bonus meal: The Twins’ Birthday. Anyway, I mentioned this cake, and someone &#8211; maybe one of you reading today? &#8211; asked if I might share the recipe. I said that I would do my best to get it from my cousin Katie, its keeper, which I did, and after bringing it home and accidentally burying it in a stack of papers on my desk for three months, which I’m&#8230;</p>
