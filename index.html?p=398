	<meta property="og:description" content="I have three half-siblings.  I know I’ve told you that before, probably lots of times. My half-siblings are a decent bit older than me, so growing up, they often seemed more like uncles and an aunt.  I was an only child, mostly.  But my mother came from a big family, and she had an identical twin sister named Tina. Though Tina lived in California and we lived in Oklahoma, she and my mother did their best to make sure that their children, my cousins Sarah and Katie and I, would feel close as we grew up.  I fell in love with the West Coast  &#8211; and, I’m sure, wound up living here &#8211; because of trips we took to visit&hellip;" />

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I have three half-siblings.  I know I’ve told you that before, probably lots of times. My half-siblings are a decent bit older than me, so growing up, they often seemed more like uncles and an aunt.  I was an only child, mostly.  But my mother came from a big family, and she had an identical twin sister named Tina. Though Tina lived in California and we lived in Oklahoma, she and my mother did their best to make sure that their children, my cousins Sarah and Katie and I, would feel close as we grew up.  I fell in love with the West Coast  &#8211; and, I’m sure, wound up living here &#8211; because of trips we took to visit Tina and her family when I was a kid.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/b8a27-photo18crop1.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/b8a27-photo18crop1.jpg?w=295" alt="" width="394" height="400" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>In the mornings, when it’s still cool outside, Tina’s neighborhood smells like eucalyptus.  In the afternoons, Katie and I would walk through the backyard to old convenience store across the street, where we would buy beef jerky from a plastic tub.  There’s now a fancy grocery store where the convenience store used to be, but a little further down the street is a mall that still looks pretty much the same, a outdoor mall, something we didn’t have in Oklahoma.  It was at that mall that Sarah and I, then pre-teens, went on my first and only shoplifting spree.  We got a paper shopping bag at a department store, put my denim jacket in it, and then proceeded to hit a few other stores, hiding our loot under the jacket.  Our primary target was a Hallmark shop, where I scored a few calligraphy pens and a tiny <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_level" target="_blank">carpenter’s bubble level</a> on a keychain, the kind with yellow liquid in a clear tube.  I had no idea what a level was, but it looked awesome, and I was too scared of being caught to spend a lot of time puzzling over it before I shoved it into the bag.  Our mothers didn’t catch us, but back at Tina’s house, with our booty stashed safely in the closet, I was still terrified.  I was not cut out for a life in crime.  I don’t know if Tina ever found out about what we did, but I remember that closet so clearly.  I remember her house so clearly, the way it smells, the way it slopes slightly toward the street, so that every door needs a doorstop. When I’m falling asleep, I sometimes picture myself there.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7b4a3-4606067700_f95e1923d9_o1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7b4a3-4606067700_f95e1923d9_o1.jpg?w=202" alt="" width="269" height="400" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>That’s my mother on the left in both of the pictures, and Tina on the right.  They didn’t always dress alike, but they weren’t opposed to it.  Actually, the older they got, the more often they did.  They even wore their hair the same way: a couple of inches below the shoulder, usually pulled back into a ponytail. There’s a set of elderly twins who are famous around San Francisco, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_and_Vivian_Brown" target="_blank">Marian and Vivian Brown</a>, and we ran into them once in Union Square, both <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=san+francisco+twins&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=agXUT6zeOfCl2AWb0a2UDw&amp;ved=0CFsQsAQ&amp;biw=1345&amp;bih=806" target="_blank">impeccably dressed</a>.  My twins are not the type to pencil in their eyebrows or go for animal-skin cowboy hats, but I always pictured them getting old together the way the Brown twins have, making a scene, making trouble.</p>
<p>In early February, Tina was diagnosed suddenly with pancreatic cancer. She went to my mother’s house in Oklahoma to stay for a while and receive treatment.  My cousins and I took turns flying in to help, and we tried our best not to spend too much time Googling pancreatic cancer, because that kind of thing will scare the crap out of you. But it was hard to ignore the fact that, as all the literature says, the illness moves quickly.  Tina passed away at home, my mother’s home, on May 29, with five of us around her.</p>
<p>The Internet is an awkward place to write about death.  It doesn’t have the right weight.  I don’t like it. But I’ve been trying to figure out what to write here instead, and nothing else came.  Over the past few months, whenever I’ve told someone about Tina, it’s been hard to explain why it should feel so difficult to lose an aunt, as opposed to, say, a parent.  For me, Tina was somewhere between the two. In high school biology, when I learned about genes and DNA, I remember being thrilled by the thought that my mother and Tina had identical DNA, and that, maybe, on some level that an actual scientist would probably scoff at, it meant that Katie and Sarah were my half-sisters.  I loved that idea. Maybe, on that same questionable level, it meant that Tina was more than my aunt.</p>
<p>She was the only person in the world who called me Margaret, my legal name.  She sort of sang it, actually, <i>Maaaaar-GRIT</i>, her voice rising as she went.  When I was in college, I lived with her during the summers.  She introduced me to Dungeness crab and to the giant chocolate-covered coconut macaroons at <a href="http://www.maxsworld.com/maxs/index.php" target="_blank">Max’s</a>.  She was the first person I knew who really <i>loved</i> the place where she lived.  It doesn’t sound like much to say, but it had never occurred to me that a person could fall in love with a city and actually get to <i>live</i> there, not just visit.  I didn’t dislike Oklahoma City, but I didn’t love it, and my parents didn’t, either.  I didn’t know what it might be like to feel another way.  But Tina and I were once driving across the Golden Gate Bridge, and I remember her saying that she never got tired of it, of that drive, even after forty years in the Bay Area, and that she each time she crossed the bridge, she felt like cheering, <i>I LIVE HERE!</i>  I didn’t know then that Seattle would make me feel that way, that it would be my place. But now, whenever I catch myself silently cheering, I think of her.</p>
<p>I also think of Tina when I cook in my cast-iron skillets, because the summer that I was twenty and living at her house, I once used a cast-iron skillet and then left it overnight, rinsed but still dirty, in her white kitchen sink.  The next morning, when she found it there, she also found beneath it a dark, angry ring of rust that hung on for months.  I am now a champ at the prompt cleaning and drying of cast-iron skillets.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2df34-photo191.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2df34-photo191.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="400" height="400" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>I don’t know who took this picture, but I found it on Tina’s desk last weekend.  It must have been taken in the 80s, because this was her hairstyle then.  I love the lens flare, how relaxed she looks, how pretty she was.  She looked very different when I last saw her, but she was still beautiful.</p>
<p>About a month ago, when the author Maurice Sendak died, NPR re-released a number of <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/05/08/152248901/fresh-air-remembers-author-maurice-sendak" target="_blank">interviews</a> that he did over the years with Terry Gross of <i>Fresh Air</i>.  I listened to all of them, and I listened twice to the last one. (It starts about 27 minutes in.)  I hope I can someday feel the way he did about aging and dying. I’ve known so many people who, like Tina, didn’t really get a chance to get old. There was something he said that I keep thinking about: &#8220;I don’t believe in an afterlife, but I still fully expect to see my brother again.&#8221; Most days, I don’t believe in an afterlife, either, but I hope for my mother, and for all of us, that Mr. Sendak was right.</p>

      <p>Dear Molly,</p>
<p>There are times when all we can hope for is to truly comprehend that even when someone is gone, trivial and cliche as it may sound, that someone could never be truly dead for as long as we speak of them, think of them and know, without needing to believe in the afterlife that indeed we will see each other again. </p>

      <p>A couple years ago we scattered my grandmother&#39;s ashes under the Golden Gate Bridge because that&#39;s the place in the world she most loved. I&#39;m almost 50 and at her memorial service I finally saw what I want for myself when I go. That bridge has a little magic in it. Every time you go across it Tina will be cheering next to you.

      <p>Dear Molly,<br />I have been reading your blog for years and have always thought you wrote beautifully.  Today, I am touched, deeply touched, by your words.  Your gentle and so powerful evocation of your aunt moves me more than I can say.  I understand your sorrow.<br />I lost my aunt in december, and people around me were sorry, but I could tell they did not understand.  Your aunt, right?  No, actually, more than that.  My childhood, my summers, the family memory, more than I can express in a few words.  I lost so much when she left.<br />I also listened to Maurice Sendak&#39;s interviews &#8211; several times.<br />May you, your mother, your cousins find peace in remembering Tina together.  Hold each other tight.</p>

      <p>Your words were the loveliest sort of tribute.  I have listened to that Sendak interview many times &#8211; it was one of the most amazing interviews &#8211; and I too know just what you mean.  I wish that Tina and your mom had been given the chance to grow old together.  I wish that Tina had been given the chance to meet the tiny person under your shirt.  I hope that you and your family can continue to carry pieces of Tina around in the world &#8211; she sounds so lovely.</p>

      <p>I am so sorry for your loss.  Your aunt was very lucky to have such devoted family to care for her until the end; I&#39;m sure you eased her transition and brought her great comfort.  During my mother&#39;s illness and since her death, the only thing that has ever brought me any comfort is the firm conviction that I am lucky to be able to mourn her.  To mourn someone means that you had a relationship so full of meaning as to cause grief upon separation, and not everyone has the good fortune of enjoying such close relationships with others.  Focusing on what you have had in life instead of what has been taken away allows some happiness to mitigate the sadness.  I&#39;m so happy for you that you had such a wonderful relationship with your aunt.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m sorry for your loss.  <br />It seems only logical that you and your aunt be more connected than others aunts and nieces &#8211; if only because you believed it, it was so.<br />My mother&#39;s closest sister had no children, but figured large in my childhood.  To this day, when I celebrate anything I think of calling her, to share.  She&#39;s 87 now &#8211; a good old age &#8211; and I&#39;m lucky to have her in my life.</p>

      <p>What a wonderful tribute to your aunt. Deepest sympathies for your loss.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing your memories and thoughts in this time of grief. Although I never met your aunt Tina, this post makes me feel as if she was a special acquaintance. If writing on the internet doesn&#39;t seem to carry the right weight, I hope you find some small bit of comfort in knowing that everyone who reads this post will carry a little bit of Tina in our lives.</p>

      <p>I lost my father to that terrible disease last year. I am so sorry for your loss. I remember a line from children&#39;s novel I read 30 years ago in which the author states something to the effect that &#8220;Nothing fine or noble will ever truly disappear as long as there are hearts to remember.&#8221; And I can&#39;t say that it makes me feel like, OK, then, that&#39;s good, I&#39;m all right with this loss then, because I&#39;m not&#8230;but I return to it like a hummingbird to a flower.</p>
<p>I guess I&#39;m more inclined as I get older (and I am sorry your aunt did not have that opportunity) to reflect on another line from that book&#8230;&#8221;For yesterday and for all tomorrows, we dance the best we know.&#8221; As I guess it&#39;s all we can do. Thanks for letting your aunt live on in your words. Take care.</p>

      <p>Oh goodness. I&#39;m so sorry for your loss. What a beautiful tribute. My mother would know just how you feel about your aunt; she had an aunt, her mother&#39;s sister, who was so much like a second mother to her that she called her Aunt Mom her entire life.</p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer is cruel. It seems to choose the gentlest, best-loved people: your aunt, my paternal grandmother. It&#39;s just not fair.</p>

      <p>I have been reading your blog for years but am not a commenter.  Today&#39;s post reminds me of a dear friend of mine, Rosemarie, who passed away after a terribly long 10 month hospital stay.  She was a coworker, but really more like a surrogate grandmother to me.  Before she became incoherent I was able to tell her that I was pregnant with my first child, which made us both very happy.  At the funeral, when I walked in, her daughter commented that Rosemarie would have said that a pregnant woman shouldn&#39;t go to funerals.  That&#39;s probably just what she&#39;d have said.  So sorry for your loss.</p>

      <p>That was so beautifully written Molly/Margaret.  I love that someone called her your maunt (mom/aunt).

      <p>I&#39;m sorry for your loss, Molly. I know that it can be therapeutic to write these things out, and sometimes the writing can help you remember things. And once someone is gone, those memories become so precious. So I&#39;m glad you wrote them down and gave them a life of their own, even the internet does seems like an odd place to discuss profound loss. Take care.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m sorry for your loss, Molly. I know that it can be therapeutic to write these things out, and sometimes the writing can help you remember things. And once someone is gone, those memories become so precious. So I&#39;m glad you wrote them down and gave them a life of their own, even the internet does seems like an odd place to discuss profound loss. Take care.</p>

      <p>I understand completely the feeling of not knowing how or what to write about something so heavy.  The internet does seem somewhat awkward, except that there are readers who have or will go through something very similar.

      <p>My aunt is the same to me. In some ways closer than my mother, with whom I am very close. But my relationship with my aunt is not a friend, not a sister, nothing like my other aunts. No &#8211; very much like the love I share with my mother, but perhaps without the bittersweet part of growing and straining to find myself apart. Under the gaze of my aunt, I was always a true and whole woman, I just needed to grow into her. I am so sorry for your loss, and so glad that she gave you memories thick with sweetness so she is always closer than a mere memory.</p>

      <p>What a beautiful tribute.  Your writing made me think of my mom, who passed away in 2005, not because she was similar to Tina but because of the love you felt for her.  Loss is so difficult and takes time to heal from, but you will have Tina within you as your raise your child.  That will be your own tribute to your aunt.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m so sorry for your loss, Molly.  A few weeks before my Grandmother died (she lived with my family while I was growing up), I had the joy of letting her know I was pregnant with my daughter.

      <p>Thank you, Molly. For writing about life, and death, in such a very true way. My fiance&#39;s father died of lung cancer last October, and as we get ready for our wedding this Saturday, I have thought many times of the chapter about your wedding in &#8220;Homemade Life.&#8221; We live in San Francisco, and thrill to live here each time that we cross the Golden Gate Bridge.

      <p>The internet can be an awkward place to express such poignant thoughts, but your writing, most especially the way that you described your aunt exclaiming about driving across the Golden Gate bridge, brought tears to my eyes. I know that feeling about that bridge too! (My mother grew up in the Bay Area.) Your aunt&#39;s delight seems an apt way to memorialize such a special person to you. <br />My condolences.</p>

      <p>I must disagree about one thing, Molly.  In your deft hands, the Internet has EXACTLY the right weight for an essay on death.  It&#39;s amazing how much love and humor and history you managed to  evoke.

      <p>Molly, I read A Homemade Life and truly laughed out loud and sobbed like no other book I&#39;ve read. And now I feel like you and your family are old friends. I wish you all comfort during this time, especially your mother. I can&#39;t imagine what strength it must have taken for her to go through that again with her other most intimate partner. The joy we experience in life is unfortunately matched in strength by grief. My heart goes out to you all.</p>

      <p>Molly, I&#39;m so sorry for your loss. My brother was diagnosed 5 years ago with Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma that was classified as terminal. The whole time, I was scared of watching him slowly die of cancer, scared he would suffer. Then, at the beginning of April he was suddenly and unexpectedly in remission and we all felt like we could relax, just a little, for now. On May 18 (Friday), we left for a family camping trip and were going to come home on Monday. But Sunday morning, we found my brother had died in his sleep. We do not know what happened yet, and may not know until the fall when the final autopsy results come back.<br />I have had so many people tell me that it must be hard that I didn&#39;t get to say goodbye. But it&#39;s not. I don&#39;t know how I could have managed to say goodbye to the person who had been my big brother, best friend and self-appointed protector for 30 years. I don&#39;t really think being able to say goodbye to someone who is dying brings any real closure or any reduction in the pain you feel. And as horrible as it is to lose him when we thought we were safe, and on vacation no less, I am grateful that he left this world quietly, with his family around after a pleasant day and with thoughts of another one to come.<br />I&#39;m sorry this has become mostly a comment about me, but all this is to say that I know how terrified I was at the prospect of watching my brother&#39;s life slip away like that, and I didn&#39;t have to. But you did go through that and you chose to be by her side until the very end, which certainly makes you a brave and loving person. My deepest condolences. I don&#39;t know the exact pain you are feeling, but I know how my version of it feels and I can empathize.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly &#8211; I am so sorry for your loss. I also had a very close aunt that was taken by cancer. She was my favorite aunt &#8211; fabulous, outspoken and in my young eyes oh so glamourous. In the end at home she was still that aunt to me &#8211; though she was visibly so different. I miss her even after several years. Your post brought me to tears (in the middle of Oddfellows)- in a good way remembering her. I wish peace for your heart.</p>

      <p>Dear Molly,</p>
<p>Your post was quite a tribute to you lovely aunt and I send you and your family so many warm wishes and deep sympathies.  </p>
<p>It&#39;s funny, I think, the things we recall about those we love; maybe even the things the brain idly fixates upon.  Hang on to that cast iron pan with all your might, as I hang on to my mother&#39;s soft, freckled, smooth skin since I touched it last in February.  It&#39;s all you can do.  That, and work to remember the rest so you can tell your own child all about your Aunt Tina and her love of living.</p>
<p>You are in my thoughts.</p>

      <p>On April 27th I was told, by a hospital doctor, that my Dad had several months to live.  I flew to Arizona on the 5th of May to make arrangements so I could care for him in his home.  He died on the 9th of May.  I wasn&#39;t able to get him home.  I wish I had just dropped everything instead of waiting that week that I was trying to get things organized at home and work.</p>
<p>I am really sorry for both us, you and me, and I am really glad that you got to spend time with your aunt.  Thank you for helping me to cry a little.  It has been hard.</p>

      <p>Molly, this is a beautiful tribute. I knew the past month had been difficult for you, but I didn&#39;t realize how difficult till I read this post. And yet, you were able to come to share your knowledge with us in Seattle, in spite of losing somebody so special. You have a generous spirit and a gift with words.

      <p>I am so sorry for your loss. You know, you&#39;re actually right that you were genetically more closely related to your aunt and cousins because your mom and her were twins, but even without the genetic reasoning it makes sense that you two were so close, she sounds like an amazing lady.

      <p>Please accept my sincerest condolences, Molly. Unfortunately, my mother died March 25; since then, I haven&#39;t been right. (Lung cancer took my dad the summer of<br />&#39;07)<br />I started reading A HOMEMADE LIFE just last evening. I have been trying to read fifty books this year (and see fifty movies &#8230; FiftyFiftyMe Challenge &#8230; have you heard of it?), and I have been so hung up on some of my &#8220;literary&#8221; reads that the going has seemed torturous at times. My oldest child (26) finally blurted, &#8220;Give it up already, Mom!&#8221; Read what you want to read. And that&#39;s how I put away Marilynne Robinson&#39;s HOME and pulled your comfy-looking book from my bookshelf (I bought it back when Borders was still open in Kansas City ~).<br />Well. Within a short while I had make it to page 133 and was angry, really, that I had to stop reading to go to bed.<br />I have a blog, too, and my most recent entry was about the food of my youth (kathleenstander.blogspot.com).<br />Your wonderful, heartwarming book inspired me to write about my blue collar bologna upbringing. Although my grief is so raw, it felt nice to revisit some table memories &#8230; .<br />Anyway, I googled your name, and up came your blog, which I immediately subscribed to. I so love your writing style. It is breezy and authentic and kind.<br />Thank you for what you do.<br />Aunt Tina must have loved you very much. <br />Many blessings to you and yours ~<br />Kate<br />P.S.

      <p>Molly, I am so sorry for the loss of your Aunt Tina.  I lost my dear brother two years ago to a fast moving cancer.  I cried everyday for months afterwards and imagine you are having a difficult time too.  <br />I believe in an afterlife &#8212; the bible says we can live forever with God.  My grandfather taught me this verse when I was a little girl and I&#39;ve never forgotten it.  &#8220;For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son that WHOSOEVER believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.&#8221;  John 3:16</p>

      <p>Your tribute to your aunt Tina is beautiful and moving&#8211;I almost feel like I know her myself. I loved those Fresh Air interviews with Maurice Sendak as well: the first time I heard the final one, I sobbed because it was so raw. I&#39;m sorry for your loss.</p>

      <p>i&#39;m very glad you wrote this, and to learn about your wonderful Tina. i had to write on my blog after i lost 3 of the most important people in my life&#8230;since the blog existed for them.</p>
<p>i, too, hope to see all my loved ones who left way, way too early.</p>
<p>The whole religion approach to life is uncomfortable to me. However, i look around at this incredible earth, teeming with life that keeps on going&#8230;and have decided that it is simply illogical for me to believe &#8220;this is all there is.&#8221;</p>
<p>i firmly believe there will be wonderful surprises after this chapter. </p>
<p>May the sweetness of your memories soften the ache of your loss.</p>

      <p>I enjoy your blog..I am so sorry for your loss, no words can ease the pain of the loss of someone so beloved..Our daughter lived in Seattle washington for about 5 years, the smells, sights and the bridges, oh my the largest city in this state, we live at the absolute furthest south city, vancouver USA..when I tell people I live in Washington state they only say oh, my God I love Seattle, so I do know how you feel..Your description of your Aunt reminds me of a distant relative I only got to see a few times, but my Mother who died when I was young was so close, when she passed from this earth we were in the room and I was sitting on the bed, my Mother was spanish and that is how they let their loved ones pass..afterwards it was crying and cooking the loved ones food, musica, dancing I was overwhelmed being so young..but thru the years I find it comforting because the people who were there were able to send off the relative with happiness not dragging on like funerals in most funeral homes..I pray for your healing and some release from your pain&#8230;I read the and heard Maurice Sendaks words about afterlife etc..I agree with him and choose to believe we will be reunited with our loved ones who have passed from this earth..Peace and love to you from an old hippie from southern california!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

      <p>May 14 2012 my family lost our mother to cancer 7 months after her diagnosis. We too lovingly cared for her at home until that beautiful warm Monday she left.<br />These days are filled with beautiful memories that comfort us as I know you and your family cherish too.<br />peace</p>

      <p>I feel that, sometimes, even though it doesn&#39;t feel like enough, just putting something out there in words that you hope someone else will read is necessary.

      <p>Molly, I haven&#39;t visited Orangette in a while but I just thought of it then and for some reason had to jump on and visit. I actually wondered if you&#39;d had your baby yet but then I came to this post instead. Can I just say, you were so born to write. I read A Homemade Life last year and, consequently, I feel as if I know you and your family. A beautiful amazing family. This post about your Aunt just re-affirms that. I am sitting here, in the middle of my Tuesday (in Australia) with a lump in my throat. I didn&#39;t know Tina, and with those few but immense words you just wrote, I feel as if I do know her now. What a lucky small human you will have being born into that family. Thank you for this insight and for helping others to stop, look around, and cheer. RIP Tina. &#8211; Lucinda T xox</p>

What a lucky small human you will have being born into that family. Thank you for this insight and for helping others to stop, look around, and cheer. RIP Tina. &#8211; Lucinda T xox</p>

      <p>That post touched me.  My mother is an identical twin, too.  I&#39;ve always felt her twin was a little more than your average aunt and my cousins something like sib-cousins.  Thinking good thoughts for all your family, and especially your mom.</p>

      <p>My deepest condolences for the loss of your Aunt, Molly. This time of sadness is surely very hard for you and your family. Burg lives on because of you, and so will Aunt Tina. Your little one will know them well because of your tremendous gifts. Thank you for sharing so generously with the rest of us. If it is appropriate, would there be a means to make a donation in Tina&#39;s honor to the American Cancer Society?</p>

      <p>Molly, thank you for sharing this with us. I am so sorry for your loss.</p>
<p>I also, separately and very much un-relatedly, want to thank you for the note iin your post about Marian and Vivian. I happened upon them almost exactly a year ago today at a pizza place near Union Square (I live in San Francisco) and got such a kick out of the two of them. I had no idea who they were until now. You have solved a great mystery for me!</p>

      <p>I&#39;m so sorry for your loss. This news hits close to home: my dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer las August and passes away in April. It took the life out of him very quickly and it was devastating to watch. I was pregnant at he time and he never got to meet my daughter.

      <p>Thank you for sharing with us.  I think we who are left are here to be a witness, to spread word of what we loved about those who are no longer with us and to try to model what we learned from them.  Your first book helped me to learn to do that for my dad who I lost in much the same way you lost yours.  I gave a copy to my sister, not so much for the recipes since she&#39;s a vegetarian, but for the story that mirrored ours.  So sharing has power to help heal &#8211; I hope that healing comes back to you.</p>

      <p>It seems that everything has been already said.</p>
<p>But again: Your words are truly beautiful. I don&#39;t know her or you, but suddenly it feels like – even though I am nearly living on the other side of the world from you (Germany) – that she is with you. And you know what? She smiles. </p>

      <p>I have been reading your blog for several years now. My mother died suddenly in February this year (she didn&#39;t get to grow old either). I remember one of the first &#8220;normal&#8221; things I did after getting through the crazy week of funeral arrangements and wading through the details of her estate was to read a few of your blog posts.  Losing people dear to you is never easy, but the hurt begins to ease with time. I hope you are finding comfort in the wonderful memories you have of your aunt.  I&#39;m so sorry for your loss. Thank you for writing and being one of the little &#8220;lights&#8221; in my own time of darkness.</p>

      <p>My aunt (mother&#39;s older sister) passed away four years ago this March. It was sudden and extremely unexpected&#8211;she was out jogging with her daughter and suddenly slumped to the ground with dizziness, gently convulsing and in pain. An ambulance came but it was too late&#8230; by the time they reached the hospital she was gone. She was only 52. A few years before, she had worked very hard to lose weight and become a healthier person after two decades of being miserable, joining Weight Watchers to shed more than 100 pounds, eating better and working out every day.</p>
<p>We didn&#39;t know at the time that this turnaround stemmed from the diagnosis of aortic stenosis with a bicuspid valve and the threat that this, combined with her weight, could kill her if something was not done. She told no one, not even her own daughter.</p>
<p>It was in the autopsy that the heart issue was revealed. Never in my life have I seen such sorrow in my mother&#39;s face as she quite literally wailed upon hearing of my aunt&#39;s death. I was devastated. Everyone was. She was an amazing woman and the closest thing to a second mother in my life. </p>
<p>What makes me the most sad is that she didn&#39;t get to be around for some of the most important and wonderful things in my life, namely my engagement and wedding to a wonderful man, our purchase of a home, and just recently, the birth of my daughter. It hurts so much that I can&#39;t share these amazing moments in time with her. </p>
<p>Thank you for writing this lovely piece. I&#39;m deeply sorry for your loss, and for the losses of many of the other commenters. It is difficult not to wallow in the sadness, and I hope you are finding comfort in the midst of it all.</p>

      <p>This post really hit home for me &#8230; Last year my mother died, May 29th a beloved pet of mine died of old age &#038; I also listened to Maurice Sendak&#39;s comments on Fresh Air many times. I lost my father when I was a very young child, so when my mother died the impact was very different &#038; really made me focus on my life.</p>
<p>I, like most, want to believe that we get to see all our loved ones again &#8230; After we die.  Beyond anything this is my hope about death. Reading your post is somehow comforting in that I&#39;m not alone in hope when dealing with loss. So thank you.</p>
<p>I followed you back when your header was this lush orange chocolate image &#8230; So imagine my happy surprise to read you will be a mom soon!  Congratulations.</p>

      <p>I have an identical twin sister and we are totally going to be those old twin ladies with matching pocket books, and matching crazy hats!  </p>
<p>So sorry for your loss.  My niece thinks of me as her 2nd momma, so I know how close you must have been to your Mom&#39;s duplicate.  </p>
<p>I feel sorry for your Mom too, because I don&#39;t know if I would want to be the one left alone.</p>

      <p>My mothers only sibling and sister lives in san diego California still..I went to live and lived there for many years, I was born there never knew it until I was older&#8230;I went to places both my parents went to many people knew them and cried saying I looked like my Mom and sort of like my dad but have the mannerisms of my father..It was wonderful..the smells the activities, the lights, the ocean, my aunt hated the Oregon I grew up in and the poverty we endured my Mother passed very young, once I got to be 18 I was on a bus to my grandmother who was quite old and my aunt..My aunt never looked like my mother but more I looked like my aunt..My only child has my grandmothers fingers and mannerisms and acts like she did, gorgeous and lovely..I just reread what you wrote about your Aunt and her life and your Mother&#39;s life it is so touching..I think the people we love who pass from this life, live in our hearts and souls forever and when we have kids they actually act like the people we loved and lost our kin I truly do..I think this is heaven on earth with people we love and hell when we lose them, to me there is no HELL in the afterlife we live and endure here, so I try to be sweet to others and to be loving and kind, I am not gonna pass this way again..love your blog and recipes and your baby June has to be the cutest babydoll ever..Our only lived in Seattle for a few years she is familiar with your restaurant and cook book(s)..ciao! </p>
