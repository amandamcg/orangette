    <p>I have two half brothers who live on the East Coast, and when I was a kid, if they came home for the holidays, they would bring a Styrofoam cooler of oysters. My father would get out his knife and shucking glove and lean against the kitchen counter, flicking grit and shells into the sink as he went, and they would all stand around, eating and sighing, making the noises that people make when they eat oysters.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/49d9a-58320031-11.jpg"><img decoding="async" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527763997122897634" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/49d9a-58320031-11.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="1600" height="1061" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I don’t know how old I was that night, but I think I must have been about six. I stood next to my father while he shucked, and he leaned down and gave me an oyster, a fat one, an enormous one, amoeba-like, dripping with brine. I have no memory of eating it. I must have forgotten on purpose. But I do know that I ate it, approximately, if nearly choking can be considered eating, and that it took me 25 years to eat another.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years. Twenty-five years! When I get freaked out about something, I get <i>freaked out</i><span class="Apple-style-span">. Like, a-quarter-of-a-century-long-freak-out freaked out. The look of an oyster, the texture, the choking thing: I was alright with the idea of never eating a second.</span></p>

<p>But around this time last year, we had a cook at Delancey who wanted to play around with oysters, and so Brandon went to the Sunday market and bought some kumamotos from <a href="http://www.taylorshellfishfarms.com/">Taylor Shellfish</a>. At lunch that day, this cook made a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mignonette_sauce">mignonette</a>, and then he shucked three oysters and put them on a plate. Then he dared me. I was tempted to punch him in the face. I was not pleased. I did what I do when I am presented with <a href="http://www.spilledmilkpodcast.com/2010/08/19/episode-19-scary-food">something that scares the crap out of me</a>. I picked up an oyster, stared at it, and felt like I was going to cry.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ee57a-86460015-11.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5528058688218044402" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ee57a-86460015-11.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="1600" height="1049" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I made everyone look away, and then I ate it. Only one, and it was tiny, but I ate it. I chewed and everything. I didn’t die. And when I swallowed, the flavor rang around my mouth the way the ringing of a bell ricochets inside a cathedral, now here, now there, and it did that for maybe ten seconds, now here, now there, before it dissipated. It tasted like seawater and melon and wet rocks. I didn’t even hate it. I almost liked it.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/eda30-58320030-11.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5528058930996582290" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/eda30-58320030-11.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="1600" height="1061" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I’m not going to tell you that I am a reformed person, or that I pop oysters like jelly beans. I’m still working on that. Last spring, the first time I was faced with a dozen oysters, a whole dozen to myself, I felt like ducking under the table and making a run for it. I was forced to resort to something like Lamaze breathing techniques, a full-body <i>aaaah-hooooooooo</i>, to get me from oyster to oyster. Sometimes I still do. But it’s getting easier. And it’s worth it to me, because there is no other flavor like it, anywhere. I’m glad I learned that, that I let myself learn it.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, when we had <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2010/10/because-there-was-bag-of-plums.html">friends in town</a>, I took them to our neighborhood oyster bar, a place called <a href="http://www.thewalrusbar.com/TWB/home.html">the Walrus and the Carpenter</a>, where I took most of these pictures. We ate oysters from the Effingham Inlet, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Ben had never had them before, and when he tasted his first, he yelled <i>OH MY GOD</i>, and I’m almost certain, almost, that he would have done that even if he hadn’t been drinking a cocktail called the Mustache Ride. It was that kind of oyster.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/c5ccd-86460020-11.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527763974386031522" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/c5ccd-86460020-11.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="1600" height="1054" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I met a man on a plane once, and we got talking about food. This guy had a Texas accent and the stature of a former football player, but his mother was a tiny Italian woman, he told me, holding his hands about a foot apart to show me how tall she was. We talked about Seattle restaurants, about where he took his wife for their wedding anniversary, about our dogs, about his kids. He has a son in his early twenties, and this son is away at college, but sometimes when they’re together, he told me, they go out for oysters. They’ll suck down four or five dozen, he said, grinning, and they’ll drink some beers, just the two of them, and a couple of hours will go by, and it’s <i>just great</i>, he said. And then he grinned even wider, thinking about it, and he sort of hopped around in his seat, and his face got pink, and he started to giggle. The man <i>giggled</i>.</p>

<p>I get it now. And I’m glad for that.</p></div>

      <p>I rarely get to go out for dinner anymore..a function of sporty teenage kids and their commitments..our own business etc etc.  BUT when we do..oysters are always in the starters. Always. Natural with a dash of lime or lemon juice , they do exactly what you described. cheers kari</p>

      <p>This was really great.  And maybe it&#39;s just because I grew up in the town next door to the self-proclaimed &#8220;Oyster Capital of the World&#8221; with its annual Oyster Stampede event every Labor Day(South Bend, WA on Willapa Bay for those not in the know ;D ), and I can remember those early tastes of oysters and the point at which I actually enjoyed them.  </p>
<p>I loved best your description of the flavor as &#8220;seawater and melon and wet rocks.&#8221;  So fitting &#8211; and sometimes a little bit of wet iron thrown in (not that I go around licking metals, but you know, it&#39;s there).  Now I want to stop off at the oyster bar in my neighborhood on my way home tonight.</p>

      <p>Having utilized acting talents for many years, I managed to swallow oysters without tasting them and thus keep my self-esteem. But I do persevere and it does get better. I am trying to imagine chowing down dozens of them with my children and I think it works for us that we bond over pasta.</p>

      <p>i think we all recall the moment we taste our first oyster. it&#39;s usually in the company of an adult and we feel both pressure to impress them but also to run and hide. my niece had her first one at thanksgiving last year and she did a much better job than i did. someone brought a cooler of oysters and we grilled them. they are mindblowingly good like that. you must try! read how here: <a href="http://www.southernbelleinsantabarbara.com/2009/12/thanksgiving-tailgate.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.southernbelleinsantabarbara.com/2009/12/thanksgiving-tailgate.html</a></p>

      <p>So happy you&#39;ve come to appreciate how amazing a raw oyster can taste.  I started bouncing in my chair when I read &#8220;kumamotos from Taylor Shellfish.&#8221; When I was out in Olympia for my brother&#39;s college graduation, I drove out to their little storefront and bought a whole bunch of kumamotos&#8230;. and did my very first shucking for the party.  And they were so fresh and people couldn&#39;t believe just how delicious they were.  Now all I want is a plate of oysters and some champagne!!  <br />~Victoria</p>

      <p>Oysters are very special to me because my beloved and I bonded over them. He told me about the poem called &#39;The Walrus and the Carpenter&#39; by Lewis Carroll &#8211; have you read it? What a great name for an oyster bar. It looks like such a lovely place. I&#39;m so glad you tried them again! : )</p>

      <p>I was a vegan for about 8 years, but had never tried an oyster before that time despite my love of seafood. Now that I&#39;m a carnivore again, I&#39;ve been eating all sorts of stuff that my life-long meat-eating family won&#39;t even touch: bison, liver, salmon skin. But I still haven&#39;t indulged in oysters. Now you&#39;ve inspired to seek them out! Living on the West Coast (Vancouver), that shouldn&#39;t be too hard! 😉</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only ever had one oyster.  Ten years, and counting.  The closest I&#39;ve come since is Oyster sauce.  Though I love that, a lot, if that counts for anything.</p>

      <p>What a great weaving of words &#8230; from your childhood to adulthood, capping it off by appreciating another&#39;s sheer enjoyment in the same thing. I&#39;ve never tasted oysters and have promised myself that I will &#8230; someday &#8230; with one of my dear friends who loves them and can coach me through the first taste. Hopefully, my reaction will be like your friend&#39;s!</p>

      <p>Thanks for posting this. I married a frenchman and his family and they love love oysters. When I say the love them I mean by a box of 100 and 3 of them eat them love them. Every holiday we get them. I try one, sometimes 3 &#8230;with bread, with lemon, with tabasco, with mignionette, with crackers.. you name it. Something happens though when I put that big, slimmy, bugger like thing in my mouth! oh so gross. but I will try them over and over until one day my texture issuse will go away and I too will enjoy &#8230; the taste 🙂</p>

      <p>Mmmmm oysters. Never thought I&#39;d be able to eat them- but I was wrong.  I couldn&#39;t force them down when first presented with them. A few short weeks later I actually did and now I can&#39;t resist them.  I&#39;m so happy I&#39;m a grown up.</p>

      <p>I love love love oysters! I can easily down a dozen or two. The best oysters I&#39;ve ever had were in Harrods in London. They have little oyster counter where you can pull up a chair and order up a selection of Irish, French, and English oysters with a glass of chilled champagne. It&#39;s incredible how different the oyster flavors can be when you try them side by side like that. The French ones were my favorite, and I kind of wish I had some now.</p>

      <p>The first step is admitting you have a problem. I&#39;m 42 and I&#39;ve never had a raw oyster. I&#39;ve lived my whole life on the west coast (Vancouver), and even put myself through university working at an oyster bar (!) I love them cooked, especially Portuguese style like our chef Joao used to make (all spice and tomatoes), but I&#39;ve never been brave enough to try a raw one. Maybe it&#39;s time to try. At least I can console myself with champagne if it&#39;s not all seawater and melon and wet rocks for me.</p>

      <p>I love oysters, and living in Vancouver, I am so grateful they are in season.  I used to hate seafood of any variety, fish as well, and then discovered the joys of very fresh seafood.  It makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Also, always a pleasure to wander Seattle-wards for pizza, and please thank your husband for giving my husband a couple of extras to go.  And cookies too.</p>

      <p>When I was a toddler, up until I was about six or seven, I kept trying to eat pickles, even though every single time, I spit them out after one bite. I thought they were so cute and funny-looking, especially the little bitty ones, with all those little bumps, that eventually I would like them. I never did.</p>
<p>And even after years of living and facing down the best oysters in New Orleans and now the Pacific Northwest, I feel the same way about oysters. It just ain&#39;t gonna happen. Ever. And that&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t need to force myself to eat something I don&#39;t enjoy, just because other people think it&#39;s some kind of super gourmet treat that only people with &#8220;real&#8221; palates enjoy. </p>
<p>Not that I&#39;m faulting you for your efforts to get past your oyster phobia. I hated tunafish until I was in my late teens, and onions took another 20 years (still don&#39;t like &#39;em raw). Just sayin&#39; that if you never feel like eating more than one or two at a time, it&#39;s not a rite of passage to a brave new world or anything. You won&#39;t be a better person because you eat oysters. </p>
<p>Peace out&#8230;</p>

      <p>I was an adult when I first tried oysters. My French husband loves them and puts a little chopped scallion and red wine vinegar on top of the oyster and then slurps it down followed with a bite of buttered bread. I do that now but only eat one or two to his dozen. There is something special about that taste of the sea.</p>

<p>I think the main reason people get a bad first impression is because they try to swallow it rather then chew it which leads to a near-chocking experience which is unpleasant to say the least. </p>

      <p>Yesterday I took a picture of a popular oyster vendor who plies his trade on the street here in Trinidad. <br />I told myself I had to be brave and be brave soon if I were to cover all things good to eat in Trinidad as many swear by these vendors and their snotty concoctions. I told myself, &#8220;self, would Anthony (Bourdain) back down? Would Molly miss out?&#8221;<br />I find it hilarious (and encouraging) that you did in fact fear and I am glad you shared your post.

      <p>What a fabulous story. Oysters certainly are evocative. I tried my first one a few years ago when I was living on the coast of Northern California, at an office party of all places. I was working at a tiny newspaper, and a fellow reporter brought a bag of oysters from his fisherman friend down the road.  He shucked them over the bathroom sink and I fell immediately in love. (With the oyster, that is. Not the man.)</p>

      <p>Wonderful post!  The first time I tried oysters I was actually attending the Guinness Oyster festival in Chicago.  I was there alone for quite a while, waiting to meet up with a friend.  So I sang along with the band, and ordered a few oysters and my first Guinness as well.  I felt so brave!  A touch of Tabasco and a squeeze of lemon.  The idea of the texture and all the juice does make one hestitate.  But the flavors and the atmosphere, everything was just right.</p>

      <p>I couldn&#39;t deal with oysters for such a long time. Recently I forced myself to give it another go. The trick. You&#39;re not supposed to chew. That way you taste more of the sea water and less rawness.</p>

      <p>Such a great post on oysters, Molly! I grew up repulsed by oysters, and one day out of the blue decided to have some with my then boyfriend, now husband, at Fog City Diner in SF, and epiphanically Got It, and Never Looked BACK! <br />We attended this event last year in DC. It is end all be all event for oyster lovers. Thousands of oysters are shucked, lines move fluidly, bands play, and dozens of wines picked just for their ability to pair with the ever-irascible and difficult to pair oyster. I recommend it to people like your seatmate and friend 🙂 It&#39;s is the bomb oyster event of all time! </p>

      <p>I recently had a bevy of oysters at a local seafood restaurant. I couldn&#39;t believe how many different kinds there were. But even more unbelievable was that the waiter described each of the different types in great detail. Obviously, he spent time sucking those suckers down and getting to know them in an intimate sort of way. Seems odd, doesn&#39;t it? Intimacy with oysters. </p>
<p>BTW, your panel (the last one) at blogher &#39;10 was fantastic. At the end, I wanted more. Something anyone who speaks in front of people (or performs, as in my case) can only hope for. That you leave the audience wanting more. Kudos to you!</p>

      <p>Loved the post, and chuckled at your brave effort with the second oyster in your life. <br />Me? I enjoy oysters, small and ultra fresh if you please. But there are so many other tastes and textures that I REALLY love that oysters are just an occasional treat.</p>

      <p>I saved the shell of my first oyster, which I had about three years ago. I love how they taste of the ocean, but I&#39;m still trying to get over the texture. This is the part, I imagine, that most people have a problem with. </p>
<p>The shellfish allergy that runs in my family&#8211; and doesn&#39;t rear its head until the recipient is in their 20&#39;s or 30&#39;s&#8211; makes me squeamish about oysters, as well. I always feel the need to brace myself for a possible trip to the ER.</p>

      <p>I have the very same love/hate relationship with oysters. I can eat one if I&#39;m out. But unless I&#39;m with someone who can suck down the other 11, we don&#39;t order them.  I might want to cry if faced with a whole dozen to myself, but it&#39;s odd because like you, I actually almost do like them. It&#39;s weird.</p>

      <p>When I was 17 I saved up my money and took my girlfriend out for a fancy dinner in a nice restaurant south of San Francisco. For some reason, there were two raw oysters involved. I think they were part of an appetizer plate. I had only ever had those canned smoked oysters that my aunt and uncle always served before dinner at Thanksgiving. </p>
<p>We were both terrified. We asked the waitress (wide-eyed, I&#39;m sure), &#8220;Are these raw?&#8221; She assured us they weren&#39;t. After we ate them and told her we liked them, she admitted that they were, in fact, raw. I love that waitress.</p>

      <p>Ok, one more post. The parents of a dear friend of ours have a house in Inverness, CA on Point Reyes. We would often go visit and while we were there go to Johnson&#39;s Oyster Company (now Drake&#39;s Bay Family Farms), have some oysters fresh out of Tomales Bay, buy a few jars, and go back to his parents&#39;s house and make oyster stew. I love this recipe because it&#39;s so easy to make. The quantities can be adjusted drastically without detriment to the yumminess.</p>
<p>Peter&#39;s Oyster Stew</p>
<p>4 slices thick-cut bacon<br />3 stalks celery, chopped<br />1 medium yellow onion, chopped<br />4-5 cups milk<br />3/4-cup sherry, madeira, or white vermouth<br />1/3-cup chopped Italian parsley<br />2 pint jars oysters</p>
<p>Cut bacon into 1/4-inch strips and cook in a large pot until crispy. Remove and reserve. Cook onions and celery in bacon grease (or remove some bacon grease and substitute olive oil). When onion is browned add milk and wine. When milk begins to simmer add parsley, oysters (with the oyster liquor), and reserved bacon. Heat until oysters are warm but not cooked. Serve with your favorite hot sauce. I usually use Crystal.</p>

      <p>I have eaten them raw.  I have even eaten clams raw (I don&#39;t recommend it).  But, I have to say I like them cooked best.  Oyster stew, oh, yes.  The fried oysters they serve at Drake&#39;s Beach out on the coast from here, oh, yes.  But raw?  Only very occasionally.</p>

      <p>We listened to your scary foods episode of Spilled Milk one evening while making dinner, and my husband asked me what my scary food was, and without hesitation, I said oysters.  I have had such textural issues with clams that I just assume i would hate oysters.  I grew up in an east coast ocean town too, but I still managed to avoid them. </p>
<p>But this was so beautifully written, it makes me want to face my fear and try an oyster.  There is something wonderful about the idea of an afternoon of beer and oysters.</p>

      <p>I admit that I&#39;ve only eaten one oyster too. It was when I was studying abroad in Ireland. A group of us when to a fish place in Galway and shared a plate. It was memorable. It tasted like everything the sea should taste like &#8211; fresh, salty and something slightly mysterious. Mostly I haven&#39;t had another because that one was so fresh and delicious that I doubted another could live up. </p>
<p>I hadn&#39;t heard of the Walrus and the Carpenter&#8230;.where have I been? The salmon tartare on their menu sounds tasty, but I&#39;ll have to wait to go when I&#39;m not pregnant.</p>
<p>Anyway, that inspired me to walk downtown to get some tea, see what else is new that I might have missed and get my tired self out of the house.</p>

      <p>Here on Nantucket, the most popular item at a party is the RAW BAR!  Slurp them down with your choice of mignonette, lemon, tabasco or straight.  I usually skip right over the little necks and cherry stones, have a few shrimp and then gorge on the oysters.  Best part of summer by the sea for me 🙂</p>

      <p>Ha!  I love these oyster stories, friends.  </p>
<p>Kimberly, I know what you mean: there <i>is</i> something a little drug-like about oysters.  A great one makes me feel euphoric.</p>
<p>Squirrelbread, that is indeed Miller High Life.  Good eye you&#39;ve got there.</p>
<p>Linda, yes, I did hear about Gwyneth!  Really, really fun.</p>
<p>Žiupsnelis Druskos and The Constant Hunger, you both brought up the issue of swallowing whole vs. chewing, and I do think it&#39;s important.  I fall into the chewing camp.  Just the <i>idea</i> of swallowing them whole makes me choke!  I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what I tried to do as a kid, and why it went so badly.  Chewing oysters isn&#39;t nearly as weird and squishy as I thought it would be, and the texture can be really lovely &#8211; surprisingly firm, and almost creamy (if that doesn&#39;t sound too gross).  I also like what happens, taste-wise, when I chew.  I recently tried just swallowing again, and I didn&#39;t get the same depth of flavor.  </p>
<p>Jennifer Jo, what scared me about them was mostly texture, but at a certain point, it became bigger than that &#8211; sort of a generalized terror.  But yes, the basis of my fear was their texture.  And now I actually find the texture to be a *nice* thing, an important part of what makes it what it is.</p>
<p>Victoria, I&#39;ve only been to Pearl Oyster Bar for lobster rolls, but now I want to go back and have oysters!  Love that place.  And I&#39;m with you: mignonette is fine, but I <i>love</i> the way the flavor of lemon works with oysters.  Perfect.</p>
<p>I Am Gluten Free, re: the panel at BlogHer, thank you!  I was nervous about it, but it wound up feeling like an easy, natural conversation &#8211; and <i>fun</i>.  I&#39;m glad it resonated with you.</p>
<p>Cheryl from Vancouver, I wish I could remember what was in it.  The only part I remember is pimento dram.  Damn.  Maybe call the Walrus and the Carpenter, and they can tell you? </p>
<p>SSteve, that waitress of yours was amazing!  That woman had balls.  Awesome.  And thank you for sharing Peter&#39;s oyster stew recipe!  My mother makes oyster stew, and I&#39;ll have to see how the recipe compares to hers.  It sounds great.</p>
<p>Zoomie, that&#39;s so interesting.  I like cooked oysters, but what really does it for me is the flavor of a raw one.</p>

      <p>I now have a major craving! I lived in Japan for several years and every winter we were given a huge bucket of 200 or so oysters. We had them every way you could imagine but still my favourite is fresh with mignonette and sake on the side. We called it the &#8220;slippery shooter supper&#8221;.</p>

      <p>You are brave! I still haven&#39;t had the courage to accept the raw fish idea, even in sushi. Herrings, but only in certain dishes, are as far as I can go, although I come from Poland, where they are extremely popular.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m still frightened of oysters, to the extent that I&#39;ve not ever tasted my first. My father used to eat smoked oysters straight out of the can, and the smell still haunts me.</p>
<p>I need to find an oyster-loving friend who wants to buy a dozen and let/make me try one, if only so that I can find out about this oyster experience for myself.</p>

      <p>I was terrified of oysters (definitely a texture thing) until I somehow found myself at an oyster tasting about 2 years ago and tried one, I was so surprised by the taste that I laughed and then didn&#39;t stop talking about how wonderful they were for about a week. Gx</p>

      <p>What is odd is that I seem to be the only person who neither hates nor loves oysters. I will eat them, when offered, one or two or three, and they&#39;re okay. But not worth the money or trouble, to me. I&#39;m pretty open-minded and grew up eating shellfish of various kinds, sometimes really fresh from Long Island Sound.</p>

      <p>I grew up in Houston and have LOVED raw oysters for as long as I can remember.  My Father&#39;s family was from a distinctly working-class section of the metropolitan area called Baytown.  It is on the &#8220;bay&#8221; that separates Houston from Galveston&#8230;. and people ate lots of Gulf Coast sea food there, which was cheap and abundant.  People used to get oysters, crabs, and shrimp, in large brown bags from trucks that brought them to the towns directly from the boats that sailed out of Galveston Bay. It was everyone&#39;s food for sure.  </p>
<p>My Uncle Bob loved to tell the story giving me my first oyster.  According to legend, I was four years old &#8211; hanging around my Grandmothers small tidy kitchen.  Uncle Bob was shucking the oysters.  I there in the &#8211; &#8220;in the way&#8221; typical four-year-old style.  Uncle Bob said, &#8220;Here Katherine try this!&#8221; &#8211; I can imagine him winking at the other adults in the room.  So the story goes that I absolutely loved it and quickly ate a dozen  more.   </p>
<p>After that for as long as I can remember &#8211; if asked what I wanted for my birthday dinner answer would be raw oysters.  If raw oysters were on the menu of a restaurant  &#8211; that is what I would order. My mother &#8211; then a budding gourmet &#8211; now a widely published food writer and cook book author &#8211; always gloated with parental pride when even at the local burger place or Tex Mex joint  &#8211; her young daughter would first inquire as to if the kitchen offered a dozen raw oysters.  To this day &#8211; oysters are my favorite food.  The briny, salty, slippery quality is divine. </p>
<p>I still only eat them in months that contain a &#8220;r&#8221; in their name &#8211; September through April &#8211; as is the tradition of the Gulf Coast. I am so sad they are so expensive.  Sadder still, that with global warming and pollution the &#8220;r&#8221; in the months name may make no difference.  Last time I was in Houston &#8211; My father who is no sissy &#8211; advised against ordering Gulf Coast oysters.  The BP oil spill made me sadder still &#8211; to realize that my beloved Gulf Coast shell fish (still my favorite verity &#8211; as they are so subtle in flavor) may never be the same.  I do delight in the fact that people oysters are being introduced as a way to clean up the Hudson river and other great bodies of water.  Still not sure if I should be eating the designated filters anymore! Maybe I can offer one to my grand children when they are 4 &#8211; and restart the tradition.</p>

<p>I thought nothing could enhance my love of oysters until I recently earned to open them for myself.  I always had to rely on them to come already opened and waiting on the half shell.  Such a small thing, placing the knife &#8230;. then a twist&#8230;.sometimes you have to work at it, but then&#8230; voila!Heaven minus the midddle-man.</p>

      <p>I tried oysters for the first time with a good friend during college &#8212; there was a little seafood counter in the nice, main street-y part of town that served up delish meals to order. In a moment of daring, we both ordered one oyster each as an appetizer &#8212; and whaddya know, it was kind of delicious!</p>
<p>I don&#39;t often go to places that serve oysters,  but you can be darn sure that when I do, I always get a nice plate of oysters to suck down all by myself! (My husband won&#39;t touch &#39;em, he&#39;s a bit squeamish about these kind of things)</p>
<p>Alas, I am currently pregnant and will not be able to eat oysters until next May. May! So I will have to read this post and just imagine the goodness through your lovely pictures. *sigh*!</p>

      <p>You know, I love your writing, Molly, and you certainly capture the experience of eating oysters here beautifully. . . but I have to admit that, if anything, I&#39;m less inclined now to try them than before! I must be missing something here: I just can&#39;t get my head around why you (or anyone) would eat something that nearly makes them cry, that they have to use calming breathing techniques to force themselves to eat, for which the best endorsement they can muster is &#8220;I didn’t even hate it. I almost liked it&#8221;&#8211;? Life&#39;s too short to eat stuff you don&#39;t love, when you can eat whatever you want! (and count yourself lucky&#8211;how I wish I could still eat whatever I want. . . though I suspect now it wouldn&#39;t include oysters). 😉 Gorgeous prose, gorgeous photos, as always, though. 🙂</p>

      <p>Ricki, oysters are a challenging thing to eat, and there&#39;s no getting around that! I&#39;m not interested in sugar-coating it.  There&#39;s the texture, the fact that they&#39;re raw, and the fact that they&#39;re alive. But what I was trying to say here is that I&#39;m glad I got past that.  I had an experience with them as a child that left me afraid, but I&#39;m glad that I got past it.  It doesn&#39;t mean that all of a sudden it&#39;s a cinch for me to eat them, and I&#39;d be lying if I said that my second oyster was love at first sight.  But it was a &#8220;like,&#8221; which was a lot more than I had expected! And it made me want to eat more of them, which I happily do &#8211; and now I love them.  I think life&#39;s too short not to give things a second chance.</p>

      <p>Great to meet you at Blogher 2010, Molly. I can identify with your oyster tale&#8211;I like the sea smell and brininess, but really can&#39;t bring myself to eat more than one raw oyster about every 3 years. Just too, well, mollosk-like, to take on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I actually had oysters for the first time at Delancey last fall. I love them and I think they are such a natural combination with a delicious, thin-crusted, wood-fired pizza. And wine! One must not forget wine. Wine, pizza and oysters together is perfection. </p>
<p>I loved your story &#8211; particularly the part about the dad you met on the plane sharing oysters with his son. It&#39;s an odd thing to eat, but they sure do bring people together.</p>

      <p>Yum&#8230;oysters! What a great topic. I&#39;m on the East Coast so don&#39;t get to try the West Coast oysters often. I will say the Mississipi/Louisiana ones are fantastic, plump, sweet and salty. We eat ours with a little bit of cocktail sauce and swallow them whole. I cannot imagine chewing them!!!<br />We were traveling through Tidewater Va and found a little restaurant off the beaten path that made the BEST oysters Rockefeller&#8230;.I could write an entire post about these. They were so different from the ones I have had in other places and need to make a trip back there again soon. So if you are ever traveling through backwoods coastal Virginia, stop in at Sandpiper Reef and see if you can get the chef to make you up a plate (or two!)</p>
<p>Love this post&#8230;you could write about oysters every week and it would never get old!</p>

      <p>Great post! I don&#39;t love oysters, but I like them. Does that make sense? <br />But living more than thousands miles from the sea, I don&#39;t really have to care about it:-) Nevertheless, I love mussels and all kind of seafood! But living that far from the sea, to me it doesn&#39;t really make sense eating seafood&#8230;</p>

      <p>Add me to the (apparently) very large club of people who overcame fear &#038; learned to love oysters!

      <p>My Dad also used to shuck oysters when I was a kid. Unlike you though, I was the type that kept going back for more 🙂<br />I have always loved oysters.  I eat them when I am stressed.. when I need to feel good. It&#39;s a plus that I know how to shuck them coz I just buy them fresh at the seafood market and eat them straight unadorned.  I actually like the texture- how it&#39;s plump and just bursts in your mouth then becomes creamy as you chew.</p>

      <p>Nice, Molly 🙂  I was trying to think if I had a similar experience with oysters, and it was hard to come up with anything since I&#39;ve been pretty fond of them for quite some time.  It finally came to me, and I remember that one Christmas almost two decades ago, my sister made oyster stew.  I knew my dad would inevitably hold our presents hostage until we sampled a significant spoonful, with him as our witness.  I&#39;m almost positive there were tears involved.  But I did it, and then not again for a very long time, like you.  It&#39;s the same with asparagus for me.  Choked down as a kid, gleefully enjoyed as bigger (and older) human being.</p>

      <p>My dad was always encouraging me to try new foods and after escargot, oysters weren&#39;t quite as scary or intimidating but still a little of both of those given the slightly odd texture.  But, your description of the first time you ate an oyster and then &#8220;growing into&#8221; eating oysters reminded me a lot of my own experience with oysters. Thanks for sharing this.</p>

      <p>I love your writing. Who knew there could be so much to say about eating an oyster?! You&#39;re a great storyteller.</p>
<p>Not sure how you eat them but here in TX we dip them in cocktail sauce mixed with lots of horseradish because we must have spice and flavor, and perhaps we&#39;re trying to mask the taste of oysters from the Gulf? I can&#39;t eat them much anymore though. I became a vegan for four months for health purposes, and ever since I came back to the other side, the texture has really bothered me!</p>

      <p>I just can say that I can eat anything that comes from sea. Hope we can keep them clean so that we can enjoy even oysters:) </p>
<p>The only reason I had an oysterphobia for a while was that I got confused once and talked long and long about oyster eggs while I meant ostrich eggs! In my defense, English is my second language but my husband never let it go!</p>

      <p>When I worked as a line cook, one of my cohorts used to refer to oysters as <b><i>&#8220;elephant boogers&#8221;</i></b>.  Even that didn&#39;t ruin them for me.</p>

      <p>Somehow I missed this musing, and boy do I love it. I grew up in Utah, and there weren&#39;t a lot of oysters around. I didn&#39;t have one till I was 28,and with a man I was falling madly in love with. It was a life changing bite.</p>

<p>After many years of dreaming, I finally had the courage to start my own blog about food&#038;nutrition, in part because of the inspiration you provided and my increased awareness (through people like you) of just how passionate I too am about food.  It&#39;s called The Sweet Beet (www.thesweetbeet.com) Come by for a visit  &#8230; I will most certainly be back here again and again &#8230;</p>

      <p>@Ashley: Neti Pot, hahaaaaaaaaa! I love the taste of oysters, the &#8220;now here, now there,&#8221; can deal with small and fresh and a bit of chew (would not even dream of swallowing whole!), but as soon as I even THINK about the phlegmy, snotball, chewy, booger qualities they do indeed possess&#8211;and c&#39;mon, there&#39;s no denying that, folks&#8211;they almost make a return trip. So I wonder, why keep eating something I don&#39;t adore? Still, the taste keeps bringing me back, and I do eat them, perhaps 6 a year, just to keep an open mind.</p>

      <p>15 years ago oysters made me gag, now I can shoot a dozen and have to keep myself from ordering another dozen. </p>
<p>Last night I made the spaghetti and meatballs you wrote about in bon appetit for dinner. I heard my husband rummaging in the kitchen at 1AM eating cold spaghetti and meatballs and then I piled some high on garlic bread this morning for breakfast! I made the full recipe for just the two of us and we can&#39;t wait for lunch. Definitely my new go to spaghetti and meatball recipe.</p>

      <p>In August I bought a dozen oysters from Taylor Shellfish and grilled them in a Capitol Hill courtyard overlooking Seattle. They were delicious, briny, fresh, and tender after about 3 minutes on the covered grill&#8211;the perfect accompaniment for a summer sunset in Seattle. I recommend grilled oysters with any kind of dipping sauce (butter and herb, cocktail, hot, olive oil and herb) for squeamish eaters. </p>
<p>You could also try hangtown fry (scrambled eggs and oysters), the historic treat of California miners and loggers.</p>

      <p>The best oysters I&#39;ve ever had were picked off a beach in Desolation Sound. My man and I swam to shore with a few beers and an oyster knife and ate and ate and ate. Delicious. And a wonderful memory&#8230;</p>

      <p>I love this. And I think I am close to the 225 year mark. The last- and only- oyster I ate was when I was about 13. So it&#39;s been 20 years, I suppose. I tried to swallow it- they pulled it right out of the water onto the boat where I was traveling on an 8th grade trip and it stuck in my throat. I could not get it down, I gagged, and coughed it out. </p>
<p>This boy then snatched it- ew ew ew- and made my friend Tori swear she&#39;d go out with him if he ate it. They went on only one date, but I have never eaten another oyster. </p>
<p>However, your post does give me hope.</p>

      <p>I was in Sandiego Ca oyster bar when I first did my fresh oysters. Back then they were 6 for a dollar. Then I got a taste for the shooters putting the oyster in the shot glass first then the red oyster sauce then horse radish and shoot it with only one bit! Just plain awesome!</p>

This paragraph is one of my favorites ever (this is Bronwen &#8212; I sent you my &#8220;pink Cookie&#8221; poems once):  &#8220;I made everyone look away, and then I ate it. Only one, and it was tiny, but I ate it. I chewed and everything. I didn’t die. And when I swallowed, the flavor rang around my mouth the way the ringing of a bell ricochets inside a cathedral, now here, now there, and it did that for maybe ten seconds, now here, now there, before it dissipated. It tasted like seawater and melon and wet rocks. I didn’t even hate it. I almost liked it.&#8221; thanks*</p>

      <p>I love reading through your older posts Molly. I grew up with oysters and have a somewhat different perspective (I LOVE them) but your descriptions, as always is so entertaining. Thank you.<br />Oh and that picture you took of the back of the brunette girl at the bar. Beautiful Did you take it with the Pentax K 1000? You know, you inspired me to purchase one. It&#39;s in the mail as I type 🙂 Even if you took it with a different camera, it&#39;s still a stunning picture. I feel like I&#39;m there, at the other end of the bar.<br />Bella @ seaandsalt.com<br />xx</p>

      <p>Dear Molly Wizenberg</p>
<p>My name is Fernando and I teach English as a foreign language in Brazil. First of all, congratulations on your blog, thanks for sharing with us such a particular moment and your life experience.<br />
This text is in a book by Macmillan publisher, called &#8220;Global Upper-Intermediate&#8221;. My students loved the story and the lexical level of your work.</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>Your faithfully,</p>
<p>Fernando.</p>
