    <p>First things first: if you don’t want to read about kid stuff, you should skip this post. I won’t mind.  A few years ago, I totally would have skipped it. You have my permission, and my sympathy.</p>
<p>But if you, on the other hand, spent part of yesterday as I did, sitting on the floor with a sparkly child-size tulle skirt on your head, singing &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-sGDe-yMKs" target="_blank">Your Personal Penguin</a>&#8221; to a small person while she sucked on a hank of her own hair, you might be at least somewhat interested in this post.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/dc19b-9f7a03251.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/dc19b-9f7a03251.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="640" height="426" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>A few of you have written to ask if I would share my perspective on and approach to feeding kids. I’ve hemmed and hawed, mostly because the topic is fraught with mines and quicksand and very, very strong opinions. I am a new parent with a child who has only been eating solids for about six months. I am not an expert.  No noooo <i>NOOOOOOO</i>.  I am also keenly aware that my perspective would be different if my child or I had a food allergy or intolerance, or if my child were very picky. What I’m trying to say is: my perspective doesn’t mean much.</p>
<p>That said, I know that <i>I </i>really enjoy reading about other parents’ approaches to feeding their kids. I find it helpful. Sometimes stressful, but often helpful, insightful, and even galvanizing. Maybe you find it helpful, too?  So, maybe, if I do write a bit about my approach to feeding June, we can all agree to stay cool about it and understand that I do not claim to know anything about any child but my own?</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/e8bfc-9f7a03391.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/e8bfc-9f7a03391.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="640" height="426" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>To be honest, I try not to think too hard.  I assume that if June is getting some fruits, some vegetables, some fat, and some protein most days, she’s going to be all right. Ever since she was born, I’ve had this sense &#8211; I can’t explain it without sounding all new-age-y and annoying; get out your crystals, folks! &#8211; that June is going to be okay. That goes generally, across the board. I hope I never have to second-guess it. When it comes to feeding her, I try to avoid any guidelines or quantities, because they keep me up at night.  The way I see it, my job is to offer a reasonable variety of foods, the kind of stuff that Brandon and I eat, and June’s job is to choose which parts to eat and how much. I don’t cajole when she doesn’t want to eat, and I don’t praise her when she does. Sometimes she eats like a pack of wild dogs, and sometimes, like tonight, she eats only a few bites. I’m sure that there are many picky moments to come, and maybe even picky weeks, months, or years. If there is one thing that I am trying to remember in my young career as a parent, it’s that whatever is true today may not be true tomorrow. And I want food to be something fun that we can share, not a source of strife.  I have to lay the foundations for that.</p>
<p>My approach to feeding June has been shaped in large part by two people: my friend Matthew Amster-Burton, author of <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hungry-Monkey-Food-Loving-Fathers-Adventurous/dp/B004KAB40Q/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;tag=orangette-20" target="_blank">Hungry Monkey</a>, and Nina Planck, author of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Real-Food-Mother-Baby-Fertility/dp/1596913940/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;keywords=real%20food%20for%20mother%20and%20baby&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1389850463&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=orangette-20" target="_blank">Real Food for Mother and Baby</a></i>. (I read the latter while I was pregnant, and it also had a big impact on how I decided to eat during pregnancy, and how I eat now.)  For me, the big take-away from Matthew’s book is this: <i>there is no such thing as baby food.</i> And that dovetails nicely, I think, with Nina Planck’s viewpoint, which is roughly this: <i>Whole foods are best. Cereals are not great first foods, because babies’ bodies aren’t able to break down complex starches. Babies need fat and protein. And mostly, babies &#8211; and mothers &#8211; need good, simple food</i>.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4881a-9f7a03421.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4881a-9f7a03421.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="640" height="426" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>June tasted her first solid food around five months, when I let her suck on some raw apple that I had sliced for myself. I also gave her tastes of my favorite <a href="http://strausfamilycreamery.com/products/item/organic-plain-yogurt" target="_blank">whole-milk plain yogurt</a>, parsnip soup, split pea soup, avocado, pizza crust, chana masala, and a bunch of other foods from our plates. Neither Brandon nor I have food allergies, and our doctor was pretty laid-back on the topic of first foods. He suggested that we be careful with citrus and strawberries, which apparently can cause reactions, but otherwise, he explained that the guidelines for first foods change so often that it’s hard for him to get strongly behind any of them. As it happened, June wasn’t really interested in solids until she was about 10 months old, at which point she had teeth and could handle a decent variety of textures. Over a couple of months, she started eating more &#8220;real&#8221; meals and nursing less. I introduced her to <a href="http://www.freshbreezeorganic.com/" target="_blank">whole cow’s milk</a> when she was just under a year old, and I weaned her from the breast completely about a month ago, at 15 months.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7fce5-9f7a03461.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/7fce5-9f7a03461.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="640" height="426" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>I salt June’s food as we salt our own.  I try not to give her a lot of sweet things &#8211; not because I think I can mold her into a non-sweets-craving person (haa <i>haaaa, </i>RIIIIIIIIIGHT), but mostly because I know she will want to eat the living crap out of them, and I want her to save room for other things. I would like her to grow up understanding that there is no such thing as <i>bad</i> food: that some foods are better for our bodies, yes, and some food isn’t food at all (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Largest-Box-Nerds-Candy/dp/B007W6BBJO" target="_blank">Nerds</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Haribo-Gummi-Candy-Sghetti-5-Ounce/dp/B000EVT06U" target="_blank">sour gummies</a>, both of which I would currently kill for), but that there is time enough for all of it. I want her to know that food is about pleasure and connection <i>and</i> sustenance.</p>
<p>Sometimes she eats everything we give her. Other times, she won’t touch something that she loved only the day before. Sometimes she throws her food on the floor. Sometimes she feeds it to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/molly_orangette/7756047780/in/set-72157627711600121" target="_blank">Alice</a>. Sometimes she feeds it to us. Sometimes she spits it out and plays with it and then puts it back in her mouth and eats it. In any case, I try not to respond. I don’t try to make her eat. If she can feed herself, I let her.  She’s in charge of how much she eats. She knows a few signs &#8211; <i>food, water, milk, more, please</i> &#8211; and she can tell me when she is hungry or thirsty. I try not to hover or push or freak out. I try. I really try.</p>
<p>So far, June’s favorite foods are milk, fruit, and meat.  She would probably drink milk and eat bananas and brisket all day, if I let her.  But she also loves <a href="http://www.thewednesdaychef.com/the_wednesday_chef/2013/07/cooking-for-hugo-pastina-for-dinner.html" target="_blank">Hugo’s pastina</a>, any meat that’s fall-apart tender, scrambled eggs, cold pepperoni, Brandon’s pizza, pasta with our friend <a href="http://www.gourmet.com/food/2009/06/an-eggplant-confession" target="_blank">Francis Lam’s eggplant sauce</a>, <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spaghetti-and-meatballs" target="_blank">Cafe Lago meatballs</a>, <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2013/11/please-consider.html" target="_blank">ham bone soup</a>, pasta with Bolognese, French fries, prosciutto, a cannellini bean and lamb soup that <a href="http://www.leciawphinney.com/2012/11/monday-morning.html" target="_blank">Lecia</a> made, and Ed Fretwell Soup from my first book. I try to always keep peas in the freezer and a roasted sweet potato in the fridge, and when I can, I make a big batch of homemade applesauce. At the end of summer, she was way into berries, and somewhat into roasted zucchini. Lately, she’s into roasted Brussels sprouts, slightly mushy steamed broccoli, and oranges.  She likes rice and beans, and pho. Most mornings, she eats whole-milk plain yogurt and fruit, or some <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2014/01/a-good-person-to-know.html" target="_blank">oatmeal</a>. Yesterday, we had <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2010/01/very-definition.html" target="_blank">oatmeal pancakes</a> &#8211; which, when cold, also make a good midday snack with a slice of cheddar cheese. For dessert, she’s a big fan of graham crackers, or half a banana and some peanut butter. We offer her water with every meal &#8211; from a cup, a cup with a straw, or a bottle; whatever is around &#8211; and we save milk for first thing in the morning, naptime, and bedtime, or else she fills up. I think June would want me to add, just for the sake of completeness, that she is not a fan of avocado, fish, or seafood. And she refuses to swallow any kind of winter squash. She likes bread, but so far only as a toy. And that is the truth according to June on this day, January 15, 2014.</p>
<p>I hope this is helpful?  Or, at least, I hope this didn’t make you feel like I feel, which is to say, totally preoccupied with getting your hands on some sour gummies?  Either way, I guess we’re in it together. xx</p>

      <p>Yup, feedling toddlers is a grand mystery.

      <p>This was lovely to read! <br />The best advice we got when our daughter was tiny came from my obstetrician who is from India. He said &#8220;When you have baby on your lap during dinner and she wants to try curry, let her. If it&#39;s too spicy she will spit it out.&#8221;<br />And so we just let her try and reject and eat whatever as she grew up into a healthy young woman despite the fact that for an awfully long time (at least for my in-laws) when she was 4 she seemed to exist on french dressing and plain pasta. <br />And she refused to be spoon fed from the start.

      <p>I love your approach, it is very natural and realistic, which I think  is not not fair to you but it is fair to June.

      <p>As the mother of a 6.5 month old that we are trying to decide how and when to introduce food to, I would like to express that I, at least, appreciate reading what you do and how you think about it.  In part because I identify with the sort of lax new-age-y attitude (I hope you don&#39;t find it offensive that I refer to it as lax) that everything will be okay, and in the last week I&#39;ve gotten overwhelmed (and confused…does introducing babies to solids really change how they absorb iron from breastmilk?) by reading perhaps too much on baby-led weaning (and perhaps by thinking about it too hard?).  So…thank you. 🙂  Also, thank you for your recipes, cause they&#39;re pretty awesome, and I quite enjoy your writing as well.  My baby boy *almost* let me make the cabbage risotto/soup yesterday, and though he didn&#39;t, really, (he HAD TO nurse THEN RIGHT THEN) it still turned out quite tasty.</p>

      <p>Gummy bears, I really feel like those after reading your post. To me that sounds like a really good approach, to make food fun and enjoyable. I always have to think of my niece who was picky, and never hears the end of it, for whom every mealtime must have been such a trial when she was small. And I agree with June, don&#39;t like fish either 😉</p>

      <p>Gummy bears, I really feel like those after reading your post. To me that sounds like a really good approach, to make food fun and enjoyable. I always have to think of my niece who was picky, and never hears the end of it, for whom every mealtime must have been such a trial when she was small. And I agree with June, don&#39;t like fish either 😉</p>

      <p>&#8220;If there is one thing that I am trying to remember in my young career as a parent, it’s that whatever is true today may not be true tomorrow. And I want food to be something fun that we can share, not a source of strife.  I have to lay the foundations for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#39;m mom to three, pregnant with number four, and food has been a struggle since the day my first child was born. Your above quote nearly brought me to tears. Feeding people who proclaim &#8220;I don&#39;t like that!&#8221; at every meal can be heartbreaking. First, I offer my heartfelt praise for what you&#39;ve begun with June, [like you need it from me, but whatever ;)]. Secondly, I think perhaps it&#39;s time for me to lay some new foundations. Or rebuild some old ones! Thanks for the lovely words of encouragement this morning. I seriously needed them. Now I&#39;m off to make breakfast! And they can eat it or not, but I&#39;m going to remain chill. *crosses fingers* And I&#39;m going to try and make this fun. 🙂</p>

      <p>Molly, I love your parenting perspective.  So intuitive especially for a first-time Mom.  As a mom of two grown adult children (yes they will always be children), it&#39;s not always easy to take the laid back approach.  Bravo!  Love your writing and your recipes &#8212; especially that latest one on toasting the oatmeal, it was almost life changing this morning.  BTW, I&#39;m sure you are way ahead of the curve on this, but if you&#39;re not making your own yogurt, you have to give this one a try &#8211; <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-yogurt-at-home-125070" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-yogurt-at-home-125070</a> </p>

      <p>Oh man, Molly. I *wish* I&#39;d had your calm demeanor when my guy was starting on solids. I have a pretty strong feeling that part of his extreme pickiness comes from my stressing about what he was eating from day one. Six years ago when we were starting solids, the allergy recommendations were RIDICULOUS. Everything was very fraught.

      <p>SO helpful, if only for a little validation. It was such a revelation to me when I read about someone who just decided not to make food a big deal. Just like you, don&#39;t praise, don&#39;t get upset if she/he doesn&#39;t eat, it&#39;ll be OK! It has made our meal times so peaceful and our boy is well able to communicate when he is hungry 🙂 It&#39;ll be different tomorrow/next week though no doubt 😉 xo</p>

<p>On another note&#8230; My Personal Penguin, what a great kid&#39;s tune! If you haven&#39;t heard it yet, Gustafer Yellowgold is wonderful for kids and parents, and so much fun to see live! Ozomatli has some great kiddie tunes too.</p>

      <p>First of all, though I&#39;ve been reading quite a while, a number of your most recent recipes are quickly becoming staples in my home (the cabbage soup! and that oatmeal the other day, to name a few). Thank you!</p>
<p>Secondly, as the mother of a 15-month-old, I nearly could have written this post. My hungry little hippo has gotten some variation of whatever we&#39;ve been eating for months now. All of the guidelines and timelines and all seemed awfully fussy when he&#39;s very clear about what he likes or doesn&#39;t care for. Sometimes he&#39;s hungry, sometimes not so much. Sometimes he shares with us or the dog, and sometimes he can&#39;t eat it fast enough. We aim for fruit/veggie/protein/fat every day, too, and little boy eats so many things I wouldn&#39;t have imagined a year ago (spicy pickled green beans! kim chi! raw onion! he even very happily chewed up and swallowed a coffee bean I dropped the other day). It&#39;s amazing how complicated and fussy you think feeding a child will be, given what people say, only to be lucky enough to end up with one who eats pretty much like you. </p>

      <p>I love this.  June seems very similar to our 17 month old daughter!

      <p>As a prospective parent (hopefully in a couple of years!), it is awfully nice to read the perspective of a parent who doesn&#39;t have a big, complicated, and unanswerable Philosophy about feeding their child.

      <p>I love this post.  I&#39;d also like to avoid the nerve-wracking waters of toddler eating discussions, but I like to read about other parents&#39; experiences, too.  My little guy (2 1/2) won&#39;t eat a vegetable -not ONE- no matter what, and you know what?  It isn&#39;t my fault, and everything is okay.  I feed him good, wholesome food, we grow food together, I model good food eating, and nary a cherry tomato shall cross his lips.  Things will probably change.  But in the meantime, I&#39;m not going to rant, rave, plead, or fret while he&#39;s happily eating what he likes. Because you&#39;re right: pleasure, connection, and sustenance.  So, while he eats his quinoa or tofu or blackberries, we talk and laugh and get fed.<br />(I just realize how nonchalant I sound. Sometimes I worry that he&#39;ll be in his twenties and never have eaten a bean. Sometimes I casually mention how completely awesome this spinach is, wow, wouldn&#39;t you like to try just a tiny, tiny bite? And when I eat the perfect little lima beans off his abandoned plate, I can&#39;t hold back the hot tears. But I shake it off.  I don&#39;t want to be a crazy food-patrol officer, and I don&#39;t want to forget to feel grateful for all the things that are going right.)<br />Thanks for a great post, full of sanity and non-judgment.  You sound like you&#39;re doing a great job feeding your baby.</p>

      <p>I love this Molly! Don&#39;t worry, i know it&#39;s only your experience you&#39;re drawing from. I too found that exposing my girls to a variety of textures and flavors (and spice levels) at an early age was helpful for overall food curiosity. I allowed them to lead me into the solid food world. When they started grabbing food from my plate then i started introducing morsels of food. I&#39;ve never chopped anything up too tiny, and let them suck on giant hunks of fruit that make other parents nervous &#8230; it works for us 🙂 June is lucky to have you making all that wonderful food for her.</p>

I liked Louisa&#39;s post on how she decided to eat during pregnancy. It seemed rational, and like I could do it for 9 months without threatening to kill someone. Thank you for the book suggestions!

      <p>Mmm, I love this. It is super helpful.

I hope I can be laid-back; I hope I don&#39;t make it into a big deal. Well, I can try! So far she has no interest in solids so I am going to see how that goes &#8230; I will not force them upon her at all and I hope she sort of naturally progresses toward them and it is fun and not a struggle.

      <p>Not that you need my opinion, but you&#39;re doing great.</p>

      <p>Thanks so much for writing this! My son is ten months and we&#39;ve been working on solids and finger foods for a few months. Remembering not to hover and to just go with the flow, especially when he&#39;d rather squish his food or thow it on the floor, is so important. I&#39;m taking the long view as well &#8212; I know that he&#39;s going to turn out just fine and he&#39;ll figure this whole eating thing out on his own good time. I just try to offer wholesome, home-cooked food (with the occasional squeeze pouch thrown in) and watch him experience each new thing. I feel like I have no idea what I&#39;m doing, but your post made me realize that we&#39;re all doing our best. Thanks again.</p>

      <p>Brilliant food take.  Up until age 4 kids will eat what they need, accommodating growth spurts and slows.  As long as parents let that happen, and make sure what they DO eat is good food (and you&#39;re an expert on that!) they will continue to make good choices.  Your daughter is fortunate and you are smart and intuitive.  Blessings to you!</p>

      <p>Brilliant food take.  Up until age 4 kids will eat what they need, accommodating growth spurts and slows.  As long as parents let that happen, and make sure what they DO eat is good food (and you&#39;re an expert on that!) they will continue to make good choices.  Your daughter is fortunate and you are smart and intuitive.  Blessings to you!</p>

      <p>After raising two fairly picky eaters I recently said to some new moms, &#8220;If I had it to do over I would cook healthy foods, put everything on the table and not say a word.

      <p>I get asked often how I raised such a healthy eater.  My son is a teen and loves the weirdest foods (for kids).  He&#39;s open to experimenting and a genius in the kitchen.  I think in part I got lucky.  He was never much of a picky eater and I love to experiment with food.  We had two food rules as he was growing up (didn&#39;t implement until he was at least 3) 1.  Everything needed three bites and 2. You don&#39;t have to finish everything on your plate unless you want seconds then your plate has to be cleared.  The second rule was to encourage eating veggies.  My son is a carb lover &#8211; he&#39;d eat nothing but pasta and bread if I let him.  Over time we&#39;ve talked about balanced diets and cooking for food allergies (I have food allergies).  We have a new &#8220;rule&#8221; &#8211; eat it first and eat it fast which applies to healthy foods that he might not be loving.  As well as for times when we&#39;re eating at someone else&#39;s house and they served something we don&#39;t like.  That way what we like to taste we can savor.</p>

      <p>Great post, Mols.  I&#39;d love to read more about June.  I&#39;ve loved your blog for a long time, but at this point, to be perfectly frank, the first thing I do when Orangette shows up in my mail box is look for a photo of June.  If there isn&#39;t one, I immediately go to your instagram account. Little June bug is addictively cute!</p>

      <p>&#8220;I want her to know that food is about pleasure and connection and sustenance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you for your perspective! I am not a parent (but hope to be someday), but I am a teacher and wish all parents would be as laid back about food as you are. I think your approach is so healthy, not just in terms of the &#8220;real food&#8221; idea, but it fosters a healthy attitude in general toward food. It is about taking care of your body and providing nutrition, but it&#39;s also about enjoyment and community and that balance is important. So thank you for going out on a limb and writing about something that can dredge up some pretty strong opinions. </p>
<p>P.S. June&#39;s hair is just fabulous.  </p>

      <p>My four children a.k.a. kiddos, range in age from 11-17.  I loved your post.  Even though I am completely out of this stage.  You are wise. This is a touchy subject.  I have some very strong thought on how to feed kids, but I keep them to myself, unless someone asks then I say&#8221;are you sure you want to know?&#8221; .

I give plenty of choices and opportunity to get full if your hungry.  I am not picky and I haven&#39;t really allowed much room for pickyness with my kids. This has not always been easy, there have been tears, and yes I have caved to peanut butter toast on occasion.

      <p>Smart and fun &#8211; and a good way to get kids to eat! Our daughter LOVES veggies, probably bc she started eating them early. When she learned that some parents try to &#8220;sneak it in&#8221; she said, mom, people don&#39;t have to go all ninja on food&#8230; just eat it! 🙂</p>

      <p>Hi Molly!  Really enjoyed your post &#8211; I&#39;ve been wondering how mealtime was going!  My best friend is a chef and has a similar philosophy about feeding her two babies, so I was lucky enough to have her perspective to guide me as I started feeding my own (now 10-month) baby girl.  We&#39;ve been fortunate &#8211; she&#39;s a great eater, so mealtime is fun and delicious and we hope we are also laying the foundation for a lifetime of healthy and happy food experiences.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; just read Hungry Monkey last month &#8211; it was great!</p>

      <p>I am not a parent, but I love your unfussy approach.  It reminds me of my babysitting days, when I read Dr. Spock (cover to cover) who said that, when given a choice, babies pick very healthy diets for themselves.  There was a study where they offered a variety of pureed foods to babies, and they picked a nutrious diet without guidance.   And, nice that she is developing a gourmet palate!</p>

<p>YES.  I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve read Ellyn Satter&#39;s &#8220;Child of Mine&#8221; book, which boils down to essentially that.  This is the division of labor I&#39;ve had with my two little ones (8 months and 3 years) and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.</p>

      <p>June just gets cuter and cuter!</p>
<p>The best thing possible was breast-feeding June for 15 months.  Have never understood those who stop at 6 months.  I had our son at age 42, and breast-fed him for 22 months.  Had planned to stop at 24 months, but he became a gymnast while latched on&#8230;</p>
<p>Love the variety of food that June has tried.  I remember years ago having lunch with a serious foodie cousin and her 4 year old.  He was eating salad like an old pro.</p>
<p>My son was loving black olives at age two.  While there were foods he wouldn&#39;t eat, I can say that at age 18, he loves spicy Indian food, sushi, and is eating most of the foods he avoided when younger.  And I have been teaching him that real food is not processed food.  He refuses to eat fast food such as McD&#39;s.  Yeah!  </p>

      <p>Yes! I have an almost 3 year old and a 1 year old and I knew very early in my parenting career that food would be a huge source of struggle for me if I let it. Loving food as much as I do causes me to cringe when I hear the words &#39;I don&#39;t like that&#39; (or even worse, hearing a parent say &#39;You probably won&#39;t like that&#39; to a kid) at the table. So I try to take the same approach you do and let it be what it will be. My job is to present the food and not pester them about it or I know it will quickly turn to war. </p>
<p>So we sing songs while we eat and we make silly faces and have fun while I refuse to count bites or negotiate. I don&#39;t ask if they like or dislike something but instead say &#39;Was the squash or the meatballs your favorite?&#39; to try to keep it all on the positive. </p>
<p>I love the kid posts, especially when they are as beautifully written are yours.</p>

      <p>Yes.  Exactly.  My youngest turned 17 a few days ago and back in the olden days I did exactly as you say.  I put everything we were eating in front of them with no pressure or criticism.  As they got older and could discuss(argue) with me, the rule was, please try it once, because you just never know, and then if you don&#39;t like it I will never ask you to eat it again should you dislike it.  I have three very healthy eaters who loved olives and stinky cheese and beets from an early age.  I am the only one of my friends who did not have eating issues with my kids.  Eating is too much fun, why ruin it by arguing?  NOBODY can make me it liver, why would I make you eat yogurt just because you&#39;re a child?</p>

      <p>As a mother of 3 little people with #4 on the way I am pleased to see that you realize what you have written is true, perhaps only for today.  I am convinced that all little people are bi-polar.  Also, June&#39;s hair.  It is amazing.  </p>

      <p>You are totally on target. My kids are grown, but one major rule of parenting is &#8220;Carefully pick your battles&#8221;.  Why battle over food? They are not going to starve, or develop scurvy or beri beri. Food should be pleasurable, sharing, nourishing. And personally pleasing, so we each can chose. And the other reason not to make this a fight is you really cannot MAKE them eat anything, and you cannot MAKE them like it. So leave them alone!! They will develop their own palate. And considering her genetics, she is destined to do very well there indeed.</p>

      <p>Love  &#8211; &#8220;there is no such thing as baby food&#8221;.  These are words to live by.  Our munchkin pretty much eats what we eat.  I basically never do this, but for whatever reason the other night, I had some leftovers and made him a &#8220;kid version&#8221; pasta with butter and parmesean.  He saw our pasta with pesto and veggies and wanted to try it.  He did and quickly ditched the &#8220;kid version&#8221; for the more tasty (and healthy) regular version.  People are amazed that he eats veggies, fruit, meat and fish (even sushi) and we&#39;re amazed that they&#39;re amazed.  Real is best.  Thanks for this post.</p>

      <p>molly, i love your approach to parenting, especially as you are a  new mom.  loving, caring, laid back but totally on point with the big stuff.  the best take away is your commen sense approach &#038; your great sense of humor about the entire child rearing experience (i wanted to say fiasco :))!  </p>
<p>my girls are 17 &#038; 22.  it certainly does not get easier&#8230;the issues are just bigger &#038; more dramatic, but the rewards are so very great.</p>

      <p>Our kiddos sound very similar in the food department and my husband and I take the same approach. We started with fruit and give him anything we eat. He loves bananas too and will cram handful after handful into his mouth, smile gleefully whilst somehow swallowing all of them, then bang on the table for more. He also is very particular about carrots…..which I think is so weird considering how much he loves sweet potatoes. He won&#39;t even eat food that has touched carrots. <br />My son is 10 months (we also live in Seattle…holla!) and I am quite amazed at how decisive he is when it comes to food. He&#39;s pretty stern about what he wants and doesn&#39;t. His appetite also wanes and waxes and what you said about how what works one day doesn&#39;t guarantee it will work the next….truth girl.

      <p>Loved this post.  When my daughter, who is three now, first started eating solid foods I did lots of reading on the subject of pediatric nutrition.  I LOVE &#8220;Hungry Monkey,&#8221; and as a few people have already mentioned, your ideas align with Ellyn Satter&#39;s &#8220;Child of Mine&#8221; (which, I believe, is referenced in &#8220;Hungry Monkey&#8221;).  We have had our ups and downs, but overall, like you, my goal is to make mealtimes an enjoyable experience!  Really enjoyed reading your thoughts here today.</p>

      <p>This is a fantastic, heartfelt post. Thank you for sharing. I love hearing other parents&#39; strategies and beliefs regarding feeding their kids. One thing I&#39;ve discovered as a mom over the years (my oldest is 5, youngest 2) is that when they do enter a stage of relative pickiness, involving them in the cooking/food prep process seems to entice them to try foods they might not want to try if placed in front of them at the dinner table. </p>
<p>Also, as I realize I have two very different kids in terms of their preferred eating habits (one loves meals, the other is a grazer), I&#39;m relaxing my perspective on the hows of eating.  As long as they get what they need, nutrition-wise, I&#39;m ok with stylistic differences&#8230;</p>

      <p>June is really growing up, how fun!  I also fed my daughter pretty much what we ate, but I love veggies and fruit so she too is a true Californian.  Now that she is approaching her teens I find it amusing that she still won&#39;t really touch left overs, only fresh food!</p>

      <p>I thought my son would continue nursing until he went to college.  He stopped at about 3 years and started eating solids at 6 months.  He&#39;s now a freshman in high school.  My only child.  We try to do right by our children and June is lovely.</p>

      <p>this was a fabulous post. My kids are now 32 and 26. For almost a year my older son would eat nothing but kraft mac &#038; cheese and pizza &#8211; I think he was 2 1/2. I&#39;m with you. Food can easily become a battlefield, not only with your kid, but with those around you who are appalled at your child&#39;s eating habits (my mom). He grew up just fine and is now, somewhat of a foodie. <br />June&#39;s gorgeous, so you are obviously doing something right :).<br />Cannot wait for the new book. </p>

      <p>Molly, while I don&#39;t have a kid, I hope to one day, and in the mean time, I think this post articulates very well a good approach to eating no matter how squeezable one&#39;s thighs or toussable one&#39;s hair. I hope it&#39;s not too heavy to say here, but I spent a large part of my college years struggling with an eating disorder and it has sharpened my ears to all the anxieties about &#8220;bad food&#8221; that is unfortunately so common. When I have a child, I want to impart the same attitude about food, as sustenance and pleasure and connection, as you so perfectly said. Thanks!</p>

      <p>What a lovely post! I&#39;d like to come back to it in a few years, when (hopefully) I&#39;ll be trying to conceive . . . I&#39;ve got Nina Planck&#39;s other book, I should read it as I&#39;ve been pretty awful about my eating habits lately. In the meantime, I feel like I can&#39;t check a book about childrearing out at the library without getting a lot of strange looks . . . and heaven forfend it was visible by my bed if I invited a gentleman home!</p>

      <p>What a lovely post! I&#39;d like to come back to it in a few years, when (hopefully) I&#39;ll be trying to conceive . . . I&#39;ve got Nina Planck&#39;s other book, I should read it as I&#39;ve been pretty awful about my eating habits lately. In the meantime, I feel like I can&#39;t check a book about childrearing out at the library without getting a lot of strange looks . . . and heaven forfend it was visible by my bed if I invited a gentleman home!</p>

      <p>Great post.  I have taken a very similar approach to feeding my daughter (19 mo).  I laughed the whole time because it was like reading a snapshot of our daily food interactions.  As a side note, your recipe for lentil soup (with lemon) from several years back has become a go-to for us&#8230;.the little one love, love, loves it.  Thank you for the great ideas and inspiration.</p>

      <p>Yes 🙂 That is exactly how I&#39;m taking it for my little one, almost 14 months old now. She also gets food obsessions &#8211; for a week or so she wanted to eat 4 eggs each day! I really do believe that children have a sense of what their bodies need (in general at least).</p>

      <p>Super post! <br />I sorta did the same with my young ones, who are now old ones (ages 14 and 18). The are and have been very healthy kids/people. Also, I think &#8220;intuition/instinct&#8221; is under-rated. I do think it a very real thing, and not New-Agey. In fact, I think it Old-Agey 🙂 Seriously, I believe it&#39;s an aspect of ourselves to cultivate. Thanks for sharing. Also, I was gonna suggest avocado as an easy, nutritious and portable baby food&#8230;.but, at the last minute, you gave us June&#39;s take on that. Have a good one!</p>

      <p>Great post, Molly. Thanks for the bit about what your dr said. I know lots of moms who get really worked up about that. My daughter just turned three. My son is nearly 3mo, and time is passing so fast&#8211;in just another few short months, we&#39;ll be giving him his first solids, too. He might be more into them than his sister was; she really didn&#39;t want to ingest anything other than breastmilk until well past her first birthday, though she&#39;d try things (more to make us happy, I think). She likes eating food as she &#8220;helps&#8221; me make supper; she prefers her veggies raw and won&#39;t touch pizza (but loves crusts) or most soups. When she&#39;s barely eaten anything all day &#038; refuses what we&#39;re eating for supper, she&#39;ll usually agree to eat a bowl of frozen peas or canned beans, which is her dad&#39;s go-to quick meal.</p>

      <p>This is fabulous! I didn&#39;t know about the Nina Planck book, so thank you for that. It sounds like you are doing a great job with your wee babe~I&#39;ve always tried to keep the fridge and cupboards stocked with choices that my kids could eat~meaning, nothing in there they couldn&#39;t eat. This has (seemed) to help them build confidence in making good choices~they decide what they are hungry for and self select. So far, so good. They are all healthy, great eaters who love their veggies!</p>

      <p>Thank you for this wise post. I have two daughters in their mid-20s. One was a wide-ranging eater from the get-go (feta cheese and brussels sprouts when she was a tiny thing, for example). The other was most particular and very sensitive to odors and textures of foods. Just looking at some foods and imagining the texture could make her gag. It was tough to maintain perspective while fending off well-meaning folks of an older generation who pushed me to make her to eat things (or quantities) that I knew were not what she would or could tolerate. I didn&#39;t cave &#8212; and it was the source of some serious family disharmony for a long time. My girl ate only orange foods for the longest damn time &#8212; most of the way through elementary school. And then, one day, as a middle schooler, she went with me for lunch to an Indian restaurant, where she tasted curry (admittedly, pretty close to an orange food). She exclaimed, &#8220;Mom, is this what food REALLY tastes like? What have I been missing?!&#8221; She&#39;s been making up for it ever since &#8212; eating all manner of foods, working in ethnic restaurants, interning on an organic farm, and now working for a farmers market. She&#39;s healthy, happy and has a great relationship with food. It just needed to be her choice, in her own time.</p>

      <p>Molly, this was one of the best articles I&#39;ve ever read about feeding your child. It was so non-judgemental and so wise at the same time.<br />My daughter is going to be 3 at the end of April and she is such a picky eater. My husband and I are very adventurous eaters and very committed to eating a whole foods, sustainable, Michael Pollan-esque diet and our daughter would rather starve than try some roasted veggies. <br />I do realize now that I made some mistakes which I am sure contributed to her being so picky. We were terrified of her choking on something. She has a very developed gag-reflex and wouldn&#39;t even eat a Cheerio without gagging until she was over a year old. So I made her all her baby food, pureed everything and that&#39;s still how she mostly eats fruits and veggies &#8211; pureed into a smooth sauce or in those fruit pouches. Every meal was a fight, we were so frustrated all the time.<br />When she turned two I talked to my pediatrician about it and she told me exactly what you said &#8211; don&#39;t fight her. Put whatever you cook in front of her and let her decide to eat what she wants. Don&#39;t give her other food. We did that and she didn&#39;t eat dinner for maybe two months. Now we are finally at a point where she will try some things and actually like a few healthy foods and even if she doesn&#39;t always have much of our dinner, she at least tries it.<br />Luckily she&#39;s always liked avocados, egss and bananas so those are an almost daily part of her diet (and mine too because I love it too) but it&#39;s still hard.<br />I am pregnant with no 2 and I will definitely take more of a &#8220;baby-led-weaning&#8221; approach with no 2 &#8211; also because I simply won&#39;t have the time to puree and make all that extra food for her. <br />I think &#8220;not making a big deal&#8221; out of what she eats and what she doesn&#39;t eat is probably the best advice I ever got. Kids are pretty resilient. </p>

      <p>I love reading your posts, no matter the topic.  I don&#39;t have children but have watched my twin nephews (now 6) develop their appetites since they could first eat solid food.  My sister started them early on things like plain yogurt, brussel sprouts and black beans, which they happily eat today.  What they like and don&#39;t like seems to constantly change.  Just watch the brussel sprouts though.  During one zoo day adventure, one got hidden in my car after a snack bag overturned.  Two days later the odor inside my car was nasty!!</p>

      <p>Molly,<br />I loved reading this. We have used the &#8220;French Kids&#8221; approach with our daughter, which I&#39;ve written a ton about on my blog&#8230; and it sounds pretty similar to yours. I&#39;m excited to order a copy of Real Food to read. Our older daughter did wonderfully with the French Kids method but we didn&#39;t start it until she was about 18 months. Our baby girl is 8 months and seems neither here nor there with food. She likes to nurse. Ha. I&#39;ve looked a bit at the Baby Led Weaning and it sounds similar. I love the idea that food is food. Our kids eat what we eat. It&#39;s wonderful. Cooking, eating, sharing&#8230; they are such important parts of what we (referring to myself and my husband) are doing as parents and hopefully we are setting our babes up for an adventurous and fulfilling food life! Thank you for taking the time to write about this.</p>

      <p>This is incredible. Molly, I hope you realize how incredibly fortunate you are that your daughter has such a flexible palate at such a young age. We &#8220;feed&#8221; our 3 year old son that which we&#39;re eating, and it is very touch and go. He loves flavor and spice, yet hates texture and has developed a lot of irrational food fears. Keep doing what you are doing! Hopefully her &#8220;picky switch&#8221; will remain off!</p>

      <p>I am always interested in how other mothers feed their kids.  I&#39;m working on getting my kids (2 &#038; 4) away from eating &#8220;kid food&#8221;.  Some days are easier than others.  But I agree with you in that children need real food.  Right now they are loving your recipe for Minced Beef, with lots of lime.

      <p>As the mother of 3 now-grown daughters in their 20s, I felt like cheering when I read your post.  People feed babies too much too soon many times now, with cereal put in bottles to help them sleep through the night, and things that really are not that great for the baby.  I followed pretty much what you do &#8212; mostly common sense, not forcing them to finish something, letting their own hunger guide how much they ate.  We went through picky days and really eat-a-lot days.  I myself have struggled with being overweight, and so I did not talk about &#8220;diets&#8221; or do things that I thought would lead them to be preoccupied with their own weights.  They are all now healthy, normal weight adults, and all of them (even the really picky kid) love to cook.  You obviously have a happy, healthy kid, and that&#39;s what counts the most.  🙂</p>

      <p>Love this post! Our approach to baby- and toddler-eating is also strongly influenced by both Hungry Monkey and Nina Planck&#39;s books.

      <p>I adore this post!  I have almost 4 weeks to go and just so ready to meet my baby girl!  Natural foods are important to me and for baby but on the same token, nothing wrong with the not-so-good stuff either.  I love your take on this topic and I&#39;m looking forward to introducing her to many different smells/textures/and tastes and having fun with it. 🙂</p>

      <p>I adore this post!  I have almost 4 weeks to go and just so ready to meet my baby girl!  Natural foods are important to me and for baby but on the same token, nothing wrong with the not-so-good stuff either.  I love your take on this topic and I&#39;m looking forward to introducing her to many different smells/textures/and tastes and having fun with it. 🙂</p>

      <p>I have an 8 and a 5 year old. They eat anything from lamb chops, roast duck (their favorite), Brussel sprouts and the like. We have been lucky and have had no allergies. My approach to food has been similar to yours: keep it low key, do not make it grounds for battle or grounds for praise and give something new a try at least 15 times before proclaiming defeat. Also, cooking from scratch, tasty meals helps. One thing I have never done was to rush and cook a second dish for my kids when they did not like their main meal. Whatever I cooked for us they ate and if they didn&#39;t, it meant they were not hungry. And yes, my kids have gone to bed on occasion with no dinner when they did not want to eat. Guess what, they were fine and stopped asking for a dish of Mac and cheese instead of the stew I had made. My (non-American) pediatrician recommended early on to skip baby food and just give them what we cooked for ourselves. It has paid off. Love your blog, by the way. Many dishes are a staple in our house with your granola mixes being a must in my pantry.</p>

      <p>Like most things, the best way to lead is by setting a good example. My husband and I are adventurous eaters and we are very proud of the fact that our kids, 12 and 10, will try anything. They may not especially like everything, but they will at least try it. We have instilled in them that food is an adventure. And we let them know that we are proud of them for being adventurous. We never prepare special meals. Everyone eats what has been prepared for the family. It&#39;s far too easy for parents to fall into the trap of cooking for the pickiest eater. So far, it has worked well for us. Good luck with your precious little one. She sure is cute!!</p>

      <p>The most important thing you&#39;ve said here, to me, is to let HER choose how much to eat.

      <p>The most important thing you&#39;ve said here, to me, is to let HER choose how much to eat.  So simple, but such healthy advice that nips all sorts of present and future issues right in the bud!  Thanks so much.  Funny how common sense can elude us in the most practical moments&#8230;haha</p>

      <p>Molly what a wonderful read! I have a 3-and-half year old and my approach was really similar to yours &#8211; offering foods but never commenting on what he choose to eat. Now that he&#39;s older, he asks for his fair share of lollipops &#8211; but just this morning, he picked out his own breakfast &#8211; sesame tofu, roasted garbanzos and a carrot. I was so proud that I commented on a blog about it 😉</p>

      <p>Molly, this post is brilliant. If every parent ascribed to your views on feeding a child, food issues would disappear. When my daughter was growing up, we had one rule: you had to taste the food. If she didn&#39;t like a food, I prepared something else. As a kid, I was held hostage at the dinner table until I cleaned my plate&#8211;or sent to bed without supper. I did not like milk, but my mother fretted over it and found ways to get it into me. Turned out I was very sensitive to milk. Our bodies (even very little ones) know what they need, want, and desire.</p>

      <p>Thank you so much for deciding to write this post.  I am so happy to read that I am not alone in the fact that my son prefers to eat fruit, milk and meat (plus carbs).  Oh the meat eating, my son is a true carnivore.  He will even eat fish. <br />I love your whole approach to feeding June, I take the same approach but I didn&#39;t find the peace this approach brings until my son was about 13 months and stopped eating anything green. I fretted constantly over it, and I wish I had just let go sooner but I guess we all have to find our own way in our own time.

      <p>Thanks for this post! It reminds le ro relax a bit. This is my personal philosophy, though with the addition that four year olds (my oldest) can handle to be told they have to sit on their chair and eat more than one spoon of the dinner. But, beeing monitored by nurses and doctors telling you your kid is not gaining bought weight, by far, (my youngest) can make anyone stressed out and act against your own gut feeling. Like, ok, i know i should not coax her, but come on, they are going to weigh her tomorrow! And will not care very much that she is full of energy, not picky and generally happy and active (yes, the climbing type of toddler). Only that she is not following the expected curve for her birth weight. I need this reminder. Hey, she loves beans, why should she not get them just because some dietician says she needs more energy, at least if she eats beans she eats something.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Whatever is true today may not be true tomorrow.&#8221; That pretty much nails it!  By the way, our girls were playing together a little bit at the zoo today, and it just hit me that it was you as I was reading this article! She&#39;s a sweet baby. 🙂</p>

      <p>So, I really, really like this post. Its so honest and I love how you&#8217;re all &#8220;just eat and don&#8217;t freak out about it&#8221;, which is honestly something I&#8217;m trying to do as I feed myself, the adult. I don&#8217;t have kids yet, but I hope I can approach food with my own kids similar to the way you do, if I ever have them. I&#8217;m a nurse, and I&#8217;ve worked in pediatrics for the past few years, so I can say from observation that plenty of parents should probably take a deep breath and count to ten before every meal. But I&#8217;ve also learned that you&#8217;ve just got to do the best you can, which is probably what most parents try to do anyway. Thanks for your honest and amusing writing, I always find it so inspiring.</p>
