					<description><![CDATA[The yeast measurement is wrong. One envelope of yeast is 2 1/4 teaspoons so two envelopes would be 4 1/2 teaspoons, which is 1 1/2 tablespoons, not 2 tablespoons. I wasn&#039;t sure which amount was correct, but I used 2 tablespoons and it was WAY over-risen after 45 minutes in my cool kitchen. In fact, I put one loaf in the refrigerator to rise overnight and bake in the morning and it looks pretty perfectly risen after only an hour in the refrigerator. Based on that, I definitely would not use more than 1.5 tablespoons of yeast in the future!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anonymous, I wish I could better help you!  But the truth is, it&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve made this bread.  (I&#039;ve been making &lt;a href=&quot;http://orangette.blogspot.com/2010/08/it-is-called-toast.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; instead.)  That said, I don&#039;t see any reason why you couldn&#039;t use a stand mixer for this recipe, and when in doubt, yes, by all means, add more flour.  I would go bit by bit, though - maybe just a tablespoon at a time?  Every brand of flour is a little different, so it makes sense that you&#039;d need to use more (or less, I suppose) in some cases...]]></description>
