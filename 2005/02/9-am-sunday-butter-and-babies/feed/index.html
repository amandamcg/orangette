					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s nearly midnight here and I&#039;m already planning tomorrow&#039;s breakfast. I was reorganising my sister&#039;s kitchen cabinets this afternoon and I found what could be used as a cast- iron skillet . Sigh! I mean I had to ! What else is there to do when you&#039;re staying at someone&#039;s house , on vacation , with a 3 year old niece that eats like a champ and 4 adults that could make anything disappear in seconds?! Dutch baby all the way]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ve made this numerous times and always love it. Last night we needed a quick dinner so this became a savory version. Salt, lots of black pepper and some red pepper flakes in the batter, once the batter was in the pan, topped it with 1/2 cup grated gruyere. Awesome and the proportions of this recipe are so perfect!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Almost exactly like the pannukakku I&#039;ve been making every Christmas since finding the recipe in the Finnish chapter of The Minnesota Heritage Cookbook. I thought I made up the lemon squeeze all on my own though. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometime if you can bear to pass up the confectioners sugar, try it with this: squeeze the lemon over, then top with a few spoonfuls of lingonberries and a generous drizzle (NOT a contradiction) of maple syrup.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made this as a post hurricane breakfast here in Brooklyn. This time the butter in the cast iron skillet started to brown before I poured in the batter, and it made it even more delicious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yum!  My husband and I shared this for breakfast yesterday and it was delicious.  Like others, I had no half and half, so did a sub of 1/4 cup skim milk and 1/4 cup whipping cream - the &quot;baby&quot; was just perfect!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These dutch babies are sooooooooo good.  I made them this morning. I sadly didn&#039;t have any half and half, and didn&#039;t feel like running out for some, so I used 2% milk.  They were still fantastic.  I used lots of Meyer lemon juice, since I bought a huge box of them at Costco, and am trying to find ways to use them up.  It was perfect.  I&#039;m thinking about making them for lunch and dinner.  Is that obsessive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly, will you post  a Meyer lemon recipe or two? I have to find some creative ways to use up my Meyer lemons.  So far I&#039;ve only made a lemon-cream pasta sauce (very good) and salad dressing (wonderful).  I&#039;m needing a few more ideas.]]></description>
