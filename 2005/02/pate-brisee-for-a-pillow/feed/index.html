					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, I&#039;ve been making this tart for years, and will be making it again for my sister&#039;s bridal shower this Saturday. How do you think it would fare if assembled and baked on Friday, and reheated in the oven on Saturday? Too risky? I know it doesn&#039;t take long to put together, so not the end of the world if it ends up needing to be done the day of, but it would certainly make things easier.

Thank you for years of inspiration, culinary and otherwise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sharon, it&#039;s not necessary to pre-bake the pastry here. But actually, if I were to make this tart today, I think I *would* pre-bake it - just because I now like my pastry to get a little more browned in the oven than I used to.  It&#039;s up to you and your preferences.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my god this tart! Couldn&#039;t believe that 1/2 cup of liquid (it worked great with soymilk) and an egg plus onions could transform into this thing...I&#039;ve just started a new job that I&#039;m not that excited about (okay, I hate it), but I&#039;m already excited to eat the leftovers at my desk tomorrow come lunchtime!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this for dinner... No time to the pate brisee (sorry), so bought a crust and rolled it out.  Compensated by chopping/cooking some bacon to add (and used a bit of the bacon grease and olive oil for the onions).  Still yum!!]]></description>
