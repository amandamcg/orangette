					<description><![CDATA[Kate, mon sucre d&#039;orge,* you&#039;ve outed me.  I do love whipped cream.  But more to the point, weren&#039;t my cream puffs prettier?  AHEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Look! I&#039;m helping you with your French vocabulary!  Behold yet another term of endearment: sucre d&#039;orge = barley sugar.  Do you like it better than &quot;ma puce&quot; (my flea)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And TanTian, your Valentine&#039;s Day plan sounds right up my alley.  As for the red food coloring, note that a little goes a long way...]]></description>
