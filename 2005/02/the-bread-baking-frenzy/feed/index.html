					<description><![CDATA[LOL! I started the bread frenzy at 17, but I blame it on my genes, specifiaclly, the ones I inherited from my maternal grandmother. I only do quick and yeast breads (the DH doesn&#039;t like sourdough, but I love him enough to keep him anyway), and I am puzzled by people that think making yeast bread takes hours. Sure, the wait time can take hours, but the make time does not. The bread I make most often takes 10 minutes to proof the yeast, and another 20 to mix, knead and have in a large Tupperware bowl on top of the freezer to rise. Go about my day for 1-1.5 hours, punch it down, reseal bowl and leave on counter to rise a second time (the dough is baby bath warm from first rising), go back to other things. At an appropriate period before when I want to put the bread on the table, punch down and shape into rolls or loaves, cover, and go start dinner (unless of course it&#039;s a holiday meal, in which case it was started hours ago). Once dinner is well underway, go uncover pans and pop into preheated oven. Total hands on time? Maybe 35-40 minutes. It just makes no sense to count the wait time. It&#039;s not like you can&#039;t be reading a book, taking a bath, heck, even cleaning the house if desperate for something to do. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the K.A.F. starter... and have recently started a second wind of baking... I got sick of reading more chemicals than ingredients in the commercial loaved... even the ones coming out of the in shop &quot;bakery&quot; at the local grocery store has preservatives and cellulose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed up the recipe a bit and added honey to the first sponge... now making a cinnamon raisin 3rd loaf out of the cup removed :-)!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[laurenb, I have to admit that I haven&#039;t done a good job of tending to my starter lately, and though there was a time when I would have offered to mail you some, you probably wouldn&#039;t want it now!  You might try looking into buying some from King Arthur, the flour company.  They sell it through their website.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time that I have written on a blog, but felt compelled to do so.  I am halfway through your book, &quot;A Homemade Life&quot;, and I am thoroughly enjoying it--you write with such warmth and love about your family and friends, and you have put to words so well how food, family and friends are intricately connected.  I am a little (make that a lot) older than you and most of the folks who have written to you--so I am on my second &quot;frenzy-go-round&quot; of baking bread and knitting.  On the subject of instant yeast--do we all use electric washing machines to clean our clothes?  I, for one, have no desire to do my laundry with a scrub board in an icy creek in the dead of winter nor in the warmth of summer for that matter. It seems to me that if something makes life a little easier and does no great harm, there is nothing wrong with using it.  I look forward to reading more of your blog and trying out some of the recipes--the first will probably be the Honey Gold Oatmeal Bread.  Thank you.  Lisa]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi. 5 years after the original post, I&#039;ve found you. I&#039;ve also survived the bread-baking frenzy, still revisit from time to time. But here&#039;s what fascinates me: I recently became a certified massage therapist. During my training, we learned tummy rubs. The first time I did one, I kept wondering, &quot;Why is this so familiar? Why is this so evocative?&quot; I finally figured it out: the tummy felt exactly like fresh, warm dough, and I was feeling the exact same love and connection I always felt when kneading that living, breathing, beloved dough!  Every time I do a tummy rub,I have this same healiing experience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just found you through the Times of London list (via Dorie Greenspan&#039;s blog) and can&#039;t wait to catch up. Everything I have seen looks so good!  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I too am in the prime bread frenzy years, and bake bread at least once a week. I was sort of forced to do it in self defense after moving last year to a town with no good bread. I&#039;ve kept it up after another move to another town with sub-par bread. Now, I couldn&#039;t go back (except for the Three Girls Bakery in Pike Place Market).&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;This recipe is an awful lot like one I have from my mother, just without the sourdough starter.  I wrote about it back in October:&lt;/&gt;http://hoperu.blogspot.com/2008/10/let-them-eat-bread.html]]></description>
