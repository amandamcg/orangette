					<description><![CDATA[Love the flavors of this cake! I&#039;ve made it twice and both times it has been undercooked in the center. I wonder if it is the moisture from the strawberries. Advice?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this cake this morning after making your lemon yogurt cake off and on for the past couple of months. The strawberries, the graininess of the almonds, it was perfection.  I knew even before I baked it as I was scraping up bits of the batter from the bowl and could. not. stop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely looking forward to your next book! Hope you&#039;re well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have made this cake twice and both times have been sorely disappointed...the texture was oddly grainy and the strawberries turned into sad, mushy gray lumps, stuck to the bottom of the cake pan. I am SO disappointed- the recipe looks delightful (hence, my two attempts), but I won&#039;t be making it again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This cake is addicting. So easy! The first time I made it I followed the lemon yogurt cake and added frozen blackberries for Easter- YUM! The second one was this recipe with fresh strawberries, frozen backberries and frozen blueberries.  I am going to make one tonight with vanilla yogurt (that I am trying to use up because I accidentally bought vanilla) frozen blackberries and pineapple.  Thanks Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, I&#039;ve been browsing your blog for the last few days and I can say I&#039;m already addicted.  Your stories are great and the recipes seem delicious.  I have a question about this cake, have you ever tried to use whole grain flour?]]></description>
