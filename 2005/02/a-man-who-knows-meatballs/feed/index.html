					<description><![CDATA[Iâ€™ve been wanting to make this recipe for years and today was the day! ( Many years have passed since I wrote it down on a piece of paper. This was on one side and winning hearts and mind chocolate cake on the other. And Iâ€™ve made that many times!) I just took the meatballs out of the oven and they smell amazing! Iâ€™m guessing they will be on rotation from now on. I look forward to reading your new memoir.
Best wishes to you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there, Molly -  I know I made these when you first posted about them, and I see a comment from me from 7 years ago, when I made them again. Tonight we&#039;re making them again, because A came home with fresh (like, walking-around-this-morning fresh) ground turkey. Amazing to think back 11.5 years, all the eating and loving and losing and stories in that time. So glad your words and recipes and insights have been there at the margins all along.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I just made these meatballs last night after finally picking up your first book and they were just marvelous!  By some miracle I convinced my husband to leave a few for me to take for lunch today and I now I can&#039;t wait to dive in again.  I only wish I could have held more of the pine nuts in, but it seems that&#039;s part of the charm of these little gems.  Hope you had a wonderful Christmas!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So good I had to write...years &amp; years after you&#039;ve posted the recipe...but these stand the test of time!  I&#039;ve made them with turkey and with lamb...and even the &quot;I only eat beef/pork meatballs&quot; people are won over!  I can&#039;t convert those same people to cilantro &amp; cumin, though, so I go the spinach and cinnamon (it works!), route...and these are delicious (and obviously forgiving, for all of my adjustments!)  Thanks to you and Doron!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For a frugal grad student take on this dish, I used sunflower seeds from my store&#039;s snack ideal. That is now my go-to replacement for pine nuts in many recipes (except pesto where walnuts, almonds, etc work better).]]></description>
