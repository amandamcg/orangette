					<description><![CDATA[I never comment because it has never before seemed a bit necessary.  But this lunch makes me so happy.  I&#039;m in college and eating makes me feel like I have learned how to feed myself.  Thank you thank you for the simple recipes. (And for the winning hearts and minds cake.  I have more friends because of that cake.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The chickpea salad was extremely garbanzo-tastic! Quick, easy, filling and healthful, too, it made a lovely lunch today. I&#039;ve been on a major Molly-style cooking kick lately. This week alone I concocted the raspberry-blueberry pound cake (for my dad‚Äôs birthday), banana bread with chocolate chips and candied ginger, and now these awesome chickpeas. All will be added to my regular recipe repertoire. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I think the picture of your chickpea salad might be my single most favorite picture you&#039;ve ever posted.  But there is nothing like a bowl of chickpeas to make a vegetarian&#039;s heart race and flutter.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I think I&#039;m going to try out your salad tonight to console myself after American Airlines grounded my vacation plans :-(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My diabetic husband and I absolutely love this dish. Thankyou so much, you are single handedly revolutionizing the way we eat healthfully. We&#039;ve made damn near every one of your salads and our favorites are this, and the warm chicken salad.&lt;/&gt;Sarah]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, I don&#039;t mean to be a spoiler, but I&#039;ve read ahead, and I am thinking specifically of the entry in which you get all flustered when people ask you about your food philosophy and your cookbook.  I think you just summed it up right here!  Simple, balanced, and each bite delicious.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Also, having now cooked in DC Sarah&#039;s small apartment, I can vouch that you have indeed become a fixture!  We are counting down until we can add your book to our collections.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was amazingly, shockingly good. Only the strongest willpower I&#039;ve ever had to muster kept me from plunking myself down on the couch and eating the entire bowl in one fell swoop.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;It&#039;s funny; every morning now I wake up and think &quot;hmmmm...what will I make from Orangette today?&quot; You&#039;ve become a fixture in my little apartment :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What great news, Nicole!  Three cheers for winning over the chickpea haters of the world!  Thanks should really go, however, to Lynne Rossetto Kasper and the author of Fresh Food Fast, since they are the true sources of your victory.  Alas, I&#039;m only the messenger...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made your chickpea salad last night and, like the above readers, absolutely adored it.  It also won over a self-professed chickpea hater.  This is a feat in and of itself, since he normally wrinkles his nose and covers his mouth as soon as he sees them.  (I think he was tempted when he saw the way I was wolfing it down.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!]]></description>
