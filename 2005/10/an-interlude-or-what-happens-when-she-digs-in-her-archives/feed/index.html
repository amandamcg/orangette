					<description><![CDATA[Amen! A lot can be learned by looking back. I love to see where/how people started out and work my way up to the present. For one, it shows me that while I&#039;m not that great now, I&#039;m working to get better, and one day I might be great too. Thank you for not deleting the archives, I&#039;m learning a lot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Foodiechickie, if I only had the money, I would hire you on as my personal cheerleader.  Thank you, m&#039;dear.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Nic, I know.  I&#039;m never one for memes, but this one--for as silly and pithy as it seems--has a surprising way of actually leading somewhere!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Julie, thank you.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kickpleat, I found that Al Gore, Sr. quote in an old New Yorker piece about Al Gore, Jr.  I just had to jot it down and keep it, because, well, sometimes it&#039;s too easy to forget about the glory, you know?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Shauna, thank you, as always!  And three cheers for stories!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tanvi, you&#039;re too sweet!  And yes, do try those Parisian flans!  Even though I had some initial trouble with the crust, it still turned out to be some of the best pastry I&#039;ve ever made, and the filling is outrageously good too.  Speaking of which, it&#039;s been too long since I&#039;ve tasted one of these myself...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Molly! Thanks for playing along. Im especially glad I tagged you, because it reminded me of those Parisian tartlets that I have always meant to try. And, as others have noted, you&#039;ve done a service to us all with this post by reminding us what blogging looks like at its best. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Brava, my dear. I feel exactly the same. In fact, I&quot;m working on my version of the meme as we speak (took a little break to see if you had posted something new), and I&#039;m struck by how the posts I love bests are not only stories (because I just gobble up stories), but also were the unexpected stories. The ones I never expected to come tumbling out. IT&#039;s a good assignment. And you have done a superlative job, as always!]]></description>
