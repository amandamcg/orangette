					<description><![CDATA[Your orange and cinnamon infused stewed prunes are absolutely delightful. I have them cooling on the stove as I write this. I have included them into my daily WFPB diet, because of their deliciousness and daily cleansing effects. This is the first time trying them stewed and I enjoy them so much more this way. Thank you, Molly, for a wonderful recipe :).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently participated in a vipassana retreat. There were over 100 people sitting for 10-12 hours a day and many participants were from Cambodia. I supposed that this was why white miso paste and gomashio were set out each morning along with more standard american condiments. 
Everyday the cook graced us with stewed prunes - just like your recipe. I loved them on oatmeal and yogurt, and then one day I wanted to try some non-dairy probiotic food. 
So I toasted up some sourdough bread, added some butter, spread in some miso paste, dolloped on some tahini and smashed on some stewed prunes. O.M.G. So. Good.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly.  I see that I am about 9 years late in leaving a comment (lol).  Actually, I am referencing your blog in one of mine, and just wanted to let you know.  Thanks for the reference to your Dad&#039;s overnight method.  I found that works really well too.  Thanks for adding your voice to the many of us who like prunes and had just forgotten how to cook them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, I am currently reading your book and thoroughly enjoying it.  I just had to make the stewed prunes, my husband too is a sceptic.  I made them this afternoon with the idea of having them for breakfast tomorrow but I am already half way through eating them!!  They are just so delicious I can&#039;t leave them alone.  Thanks for the recipe!  Julie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Karen, I eat the prunes and the oranges, so be sure try them both!  I don&#039;t tend to warm it when I&#039;m eating it with yogurt, but you certainly could.  If I were going to serve it with some ice cream for dessert, say, a little warmth would be very nice.  You can do it however you like!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Made these over the weekend - anxious to try with some greek yogurt this week.  Two quick questions.  Do you eat the prunes and the orange slices or just the prunes?  Do you warm this up when eating it with yogurt or just straight from the refrigerator.  Some of my prunes kind of exploded and deflated, but I think I may have had the rolling boil going for a bit too long.  Thanks!  I&#039;m reading your book right now and loving it : )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tried these tonight, and was astonished at how lovely they were! I threw in a handful of dried cranberries, and used cranberry juice in place of half the water, and wow, yumminess. Thanks for introducing a new fruit to my life!]]></description>
