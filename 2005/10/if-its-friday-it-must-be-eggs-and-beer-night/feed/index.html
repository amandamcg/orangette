					<description><![CDATA[I know this post is 10 years old. I LOVE this recipe. I have given it to SO MANY people. I specifically keep a sage plant in my garden in part because I love this stuff. Still haven&#039;t mastered the egg poaching, though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Made this last night and it was SUBLIME! Absolutely delicious. This would have gone really well with the slightly sparkling pinot grigio we discovered last week. Instead, we had red wine. Still good.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I used the smoked paprika instead of plain, and added a little pile of beluga lentils between the yogurt and the eggs for more substance. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The beauty of this recipe is that it&#039;s simple and quick, yet has deep, complex flavors. It&#039;s hard to find recipes like that, and when I do, they&#039;re like GOLD. I&#039;ll be making this again and again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gina Louise, I&#039;m so glad to hear that you&#039;ve been won over to the ways of Mamie Nova!  I had a feeling.  Do me a favor, would you, and think of me when you pop open a rhubarbe rose?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Brandon, it&#039;s lovely to meet you.    I&#039;ve seen your site on food porn watch, I believe, and I&#039;m looking forward to heading back over there for a more thorough perusal! &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Pomegranate, you&#039;re hunch was correct.  That is not the []!  Mine doesn&#039;t have his own blog; he&#039;s too busy reading mine.  Heh heh.  At any  rate, ma cherie, thank you for the lovely words you&#039;ve bestowed upon me. I am &lt;&gt;thrilled&lt;&gt; to hear that you tried the Turkish eggs--and better yet, that they were a smashing success!  And as for the Rancho La Puerta granola, I know, isn&#039;t it delicious?  I had some just this morning, myself...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Rachael, thank you!  And if you&#039;re not a poached-egg fan, might you consider giving it a go with fried eggs, or sunny-side up?  As long as the yolk is runny, I&#039;m not picky.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Lisa, thank you! I was initially seized with dread when you mentioned the Turk in the kitchen--&lt;&gt;oh no!  my recipe must be a fake!&lt;&gt;--but I&#039;ve now caught my breath, knowing that the dish at least passed inspection.  Phew! You&#039;re dreamy, as always.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, dear Shauna.  Turkish eggs might might a good Sunday lunch one day, don&#039;t you think?  And as for Eero, yes, I think he&#039;d quickly have you entranced.  I bet he&#039;d even  say &quot;Democrat Shauna&quot; in your honor.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And dharma, thank you for letting me know!  Now I only wish I could properly pronounce it.  Sniffle, sniffle.]]></description>
