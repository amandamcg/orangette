					<description><![CDATA[Two things: Try mizithra cheese in this. It is absolutely to die for. I love romano, but mizithra has a fantastic distinctive flavor that I can never get enough of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less important, but still important: the link to this on your recipe list is wrong. I had to search the google to find it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this recipe!!  Not only is it delicious, but my (Italian) mother&#039;s maiden name is Pepe, which makes me like the dish all the more.  just taught a friend to make it and decided to google &quot;cacio e pepe&quot; for the heck of it, and this blog entry came up.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Beautiful photos, and I like the idea of using the pasta water for moisture (as opposed to olive oil, which I&#039;ve always done).  I&#039;ll give it a shot the next time I make it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lucette, oh, how I wish my mother could have come over!  ANTM certainly helped pass the time, but because it involved neither hugs nor soup, it wasn&#039;t particularly comforting.  But I know, isn&#039;t it horrifyingly irresistable?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What is it about AMNTM? I know I shouldn&#039;t love it, but I do.&lt;/&gt;When I had my first grownup flu (many years ago now), I was lucky enough to have my mother available--she came over, cleaned the house (without commenting on its state), made soup, took care of the babies. I still remember how heavenly it was to lie on the couch and not have to worry about anything except being sick.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aw, thank you, pomegranate.  I&#039;m pleased to report that your wishes--and the turtle&#039;s--seem to be working...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Dave, so good to see you! Your pastina treatment sounds wonderful, so plain and delicious.  I think I&#039;d be wise to start a &quot;Food Options When Sick&quot; list, now that I&#039;ve got a good number of soothing suggestions; but then again, that would require acknowledging that I might actually get the flu &lt;&gt;again&lt;&gt;.  Right now, denial feels better.]]></description>
