					<description><![CDATA[Oh, bloody hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Molly, I&#039;ve been working my way through the archives for a while now, and I have to say that this entry is one of the most evocative, sensuous, sensual pieces I&#039;ve ever read.  (I wrote that before I saw very much the same thing written by the first commenter, I promise!)  I can taste the pears and the caramel, that blacky-brown coffee, feel the warmth of the kitchen and the bed beneath the canopy...kudos to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that you wrote it at 17...color me envious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it makes my writing muscles itch for a workout, however.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly...Your writing is beautiful. The words, lilting and soft, melting into each other and weaving a warm and lovely blanket of sentimentality. Oh, to write like that and be 17. The beauty of falling in love with two things at once; food, and writing. The marvelous way they combine together. And the descriptions of the food itself brings me to the clear pictures and imaginations of just what you mean. Thank you for blessing anyone who wants to see with this gift of talent. It does my eyes, mind, soul some good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This makes me smile, for several reasons. In 1996, I was six years old, probably sitting in my bed and dreaming about the Backstreet Boys. Wafting through the house was probably something simple, like baked pork chops and over-cooked rice. My tastes were undeveloped [though they definitely still are today], and my clothing was far from individualistic. I was carefree and shy, and couldnâ€™t imagine even being ten. &lt;br /&gt;Reading this makes me feel hopeful; at seventeen you wrote eloquently and in a confessional tone, which reminds me so much of how I write now. In fact, traces of your writing style are very familiar to me. I can only hope that one day I am able to write as well as you currently do. (:]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just came across this recipe while searching your index for a way to use up my pears. It reminded me how much I love your writing and your book. I borrowed it from the library a few months ago but now I know I need to add it to my Christmas list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks again for sharing&lt;br /&gt;xo]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ll be pleased to note, mav, that I  &lt;&gt;did&lt;&gt; go into Rice to Riches last month in SoHo!  Brandon and I went in and snooped around, scoping out all the flavors...but we&#039;d just been to Il Laboratorio del Gelato, so we decided to wait til next time.  Sniffle, sniffle.  Looks like I&#039;ll just have to make rice pudding at home instead, in homage to Burg.  And speaking of home, hurry up and get over here to my neck of the woods!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lisa, you&#039;re destroying me.  My head is going to swell to immeasurable proportions if you don&#039;t ease up, my dear.  You&#039;re delicious.&lt;/&gt;P.S.
