					<description><![CDATA[I just stumbled upon these in your recipe index and canÂ´t wait to try them! I was just wondering if I could swap the orange-flower water for something else...or maybe leave out altogether?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good god this sounds absolutely divine. I&#039;d make some right now but I know I&#039;d eat them all without sharing. Then again...that might not be so bad :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Irina, I&#039;m not sure what to tell you!  I haven&#039;t made these cupcakes in a couple of years, so I don&#039;t remember the exact consistency of the cake batter.  I can&#039;t say that I remember it being particularly thick, though.  I wish I could be more helpful.  Sorry about that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had to make do without bourbon or orange flavor, but the cupcakes were still REALLY good. Here&#039;s a question: I found it almost impossible to do the swirly thing with the knife to marble the cupcakes because my chocolate batter was very thick and stuck to the knife in one big glob. Is that normal? I followed the recipe exactly other than making the omissions above and substituting soy milk for the regular milk. Also, I found that I definitely could have used all of the ricotta mixture because my cupcakes didn&#039;t rise much beyond the rims of the muffin cups.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks for another delicious recipe!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Irina]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly!  I stumbled on your blog  through other blogs while looking for a sweet recipe to catch my fancy.  And who isn&#039;t intrigued by the combination of cheese and chocolate?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;However, since you mentioned blue cheese and chocolate, and since you live in Seattle, near to my beloved Portland, I felt it was only fair to tell you about this place:  http://www.pixpatisserie.com/collections/chocolate&lt;/&gt;Please note the blue cheese truffles.  My goodness, they will blow your mind and if you&#039;re not already mentally planning a trip south, well...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks for the recipe, I&#039;m happy to have found your site!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, you are dangerously influential. &lt;/&gt;While I read the recipe I had to munch some parmesan; then I had to gather the ingredients, which included stopping by my parents&#039; house to --let&#039;s call it what it was -- steal some of their amazing homelaid eggs and the end of a bottle of bourbon. There followed some mixing, tasting, baking, and delighted friends at dinner. &lt;/&gt;Several cupcakes flew with me from Sydney to Melbourne on the weekend and none made it home. Thanks for the wonderful recipe and blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Julia -&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hmm!  Wish I knew what to tell you.  I&#039;ve never tried making a cupcake like this into a cake, and I really have no idea how the ricotta filling would do.  I&#039;m inclined to think it might not work very well, but really, you&#039;ve stumped me!  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;If you do decide to try it, I&#039;d suggest an 8- or 9-inch round pan - that&#039;s usually about the equivalent of 12 cupcakes.  Let me know how things turn out...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly! Just found this recipe by looking through your archives, am dying to make it now! Just one question, do you think it would work baked as one big cake as opposed to 12 cupcakes? Any idea about tin size / baking time?&lt;/&gt;Thanks a million,&lt;/&gt;Julia]]></description>
