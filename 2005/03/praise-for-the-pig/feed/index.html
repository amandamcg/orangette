					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d been thinking about rhubarb for a while - I love what my aunt Molly does with it, but I wasn&#039;t so sure about my skillz.  I figured this would be an easy introduction, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO good.  SO ridiculously unbelievable &quot;this did only have approximately five ingredients in it, right&quot; delicious.  Had some for dessert tonight, and anticipate that I will have at least three servings tomorrow. I&#039;m stifling the urge to pick up more rhubarb at the market this weekend and make it again next week.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mike, I don&#039;t think we can get Mark to give up his taco secrets--or rather, I&#039;m not sure he&#039;d even remember exactly how he did it!  As for Justin&#039;s salsa, however, I think it was a riff on this recipe: http://saveur.com/article.jsp?ID=4777&amp;typeID=120.  His addition of avocado was an improvisation...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ahh, a new holiday I can truly support!

					<description><![CDATA[I love the idea and am so sad I never knew you when I lived in Seattle.  My mom gets the best pig from some farm in Yelm.  I highly recommend, but I can&#039;t tell you the name of the place.  Going in on a pig with some friends would be great regardless of the farm, don&#039;t you think?  Also -- no pig for me today; it&#039;s Good Friday.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sean, so sorry to have caused such unwelcome hunger!  Did you get some lunch?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Matt, the rhubarb in the crumble has definitely been tamed by the sugar, but it still has that slightly tart edge.  For your family, though, you might try cutting back a bit on the granulated sugar.  Let me know what you think.  Ahhh, rhubarb season!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just out of curiousity, how tart is the finished crumble? In my family we enjoy our baked rhubarb goods on the tart side. Looks like it&#039;s time to run down to the grocery store and pick up some fresh rhubarb!]]></description>
