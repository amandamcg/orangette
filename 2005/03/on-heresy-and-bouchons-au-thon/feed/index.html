Nope, it&#039;s just onion that you mince yourself - actually, fine dice is more like it.  You don&#039;t need to fully mince.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is the minced onion called for in the recipe, suppose to be the minced onion found amongst the spices at the grocer, or am I to mince the onion myself? I feel that when I mince the onion myself, it is very wet. Any directions?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read your book cover to cover on our honeymoon last week. It was great to reflect on our own courtship and wedding prep and our meals day in and out while doing so. I have to say, I identified more with the cooks in your story than the bakers (because that&#039;s me) and I couldn&#039;t wait to get back to try bouchons au thon. I just made them for our lunch today and I&#039;m so happy I&#039;ve met you, your blog, your book and your life!&lt;br /&gt;YUM!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these this weekend- I wasn&#039;t sure about the texture fresh from the oven, but at room temperature and then cold the next day they were divine. As with most things I love, I incorporated mayo into the mix by serving them with a smoked paprika aioli, which was INCREDIBLE. Thank you for the wonderful, simple recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[fromkansas, that&#039;s a good question.  I thaw my bouchons at room temperature, and to be honest, I can&#039;t remember how long it takes, but it shouldn&#039;t be more than a couple of hours.  To reheat, I&#039;ve tried a number of tactics: microwaving, warming in the toaster oven, and warming in the regular oven.  The last two work best.  (The microwave has a tendency to make the bouchons spongy, so I&#039;d avoid it.) Set your toaster oven or regular oven to a low to moderate heat (300-350), and warm until the bouchons are hot to the touch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[have been looking forward to making these since i read your book, had to sub balkan style yogurt (added 1/2tsp lemon)and used up all the cheeses i had on hand (motsa, cheddar, swiss, montery jack). Although the 18mnth old ate it, the 30 mnth old did not. They were OK, but that&#039;s about it. I would classify this as a tuna meatloaf. Maybe if I do this again I might add some b/powder,seems to need to ouf up a bit. It&#039;s been an hour and half and I&#039;m sitting here with my second glass of wine, and there is an after taste. Doubled the recipe and I will wait for tomorrow lunch (4 muffins left) to decide if I make these again for our &quot;fish once a week dish&quot; So far the &quot;Basa Fingers&quot; are way better and we all look forward to those. I really wanted to like these, but eeeh....I don&#039;t think so much.....]]></description>
