					<description><![CDATA[This simple recipe has been tempting me, but was trickier than it looks! How do you keep the eggs from carmelizing and becoming hard, like mine did? And the little dance to keep the eggs soft eluded me. Maybe next attempt?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to leave a comment and let you know that I&#039;ve been making this recipe on and off for a few years and I&#039;ve always loved it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made it for my boyfriend for the first time today. He will almost never eat scrambled eggs this way, he likes them much dryer, and in larger chunks, but after taking two bites he said he was surprised that this wasn&#039;t served in restaurants. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been cooking in restaurants since age 15, I am now 23. I started because I loved it and continued because I was good at it. It&#039;s been a good six months since I made something I wanted to eat... until tonight. For some reason I picked up the May, 2008 issue of Bon Appetit, and read your article on &#039;everyday cheese souffle.&#039; I realized that I have never made a cheese souffle, called my mom and told her so, then went to her house and made it. I think I ate about 3/4 of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards I decided to look up your blog  and for some reason chose this month and this posting to read. I love eggs today. And the French. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad to hear it, Anonymous.  I love your variation with caramelized onions, tomatoes, and oregano - that sounds &lt;&gt;delicious&lt;&gt;!  I try to always keep some caramelized onions around the house, mainly for eating with fresh goat cheese and crackers, but now you&#039;ve inspired me to slip them alongside my eggs too!  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lushlife, I have to give credit where it&#039;s due: Michael Roberts, whose egg method I adapted, came up with the &quot;dance&quot; wording.  I loved it too, so I borrowed it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Estelle, thanks so much for the inspiration!  C&#039;etait vraiment trop delicieux!]]></description>
