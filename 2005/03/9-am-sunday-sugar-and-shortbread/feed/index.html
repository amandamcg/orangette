They definitely DO NOT make waffle irons like they used to! My Aunt Dolly and I lament this fact every time she makes her killer waffles. (Even though in a trained chef and we use the exact same ingredients in the exact same quantities, her waffles are always better!) get that old boy re-wired! You won’t regret it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Molly,  having grown up with my Grandma&#039;s (Mom Bell&#039;s, since she raised me) old, old waffle iron, I was considering having it rewired.

					<description><![CDATA[I want to make these tomorrow, but I&#039;m really confused. Are we supposed to just add the room temperature butter (which would still be solid) to the batter? Or are supposed to melt it first? Or are we supposed to beat the butter and sugar first?? HELP PLEASE!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of making these for dessert and serving with ice cream. I just really don&#039;t think I could serve something like this to my family and actually call it breakfast. Good lord! But, warm maple syrup and cold ice cream for after dinner. Oh, yes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many Years ago my mother was given a waffle receipe .It&#039;s origins were from Denmark I believe .Over the years she made them from memory and in her later years there was some problem in the replication of her , family named &quot;Granny&#039;s Waffles&quot;. There was a complaints about our attempts to duplicate Granny&#039;s Waffles .The problem was with the modern Irons ,it was the distance ,or thickness or distance between the top and bottom squares on the iron itself .They caused the iron to over cook the thin portions between the top and bottom squares of the waffle griddle plates.We stiil have the origional Waffle Iron although it needs a re-wire .I have looked at many new irons but have not found anything close to the old one .I am about to try Granny&#039;s Waffles again or Jimmy&#039;s soon .This time I am going to try and bake as a cookie style using a moulded small(bite size)cupcake style tray .Later I plan to try some modifications ,maybe adding wheat gem or whole wheat flower or peanut butter .My family and friends enjoy the taste at anytime of the day as a snack .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t wait to try these waffles!  It&#039;s interesting to me that they don&#039;t contain any leavening which must be why they have the shortbread consistency. Oh, all that glorious butter!!  Don&#039;t tell anyone I said that butter is glorious...I&#039;m a dietitian!!]]></description>
