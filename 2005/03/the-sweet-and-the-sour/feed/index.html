					<description><![CDATA[Molly, &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;How in the world do you get your tart shells to look perfectly even like that? I make tartlets everyday but they always shrink back some (even with pie weights). Every little indent is perfect even and flat on top.  How DO you do it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[xoch, to tell you the truth, I can&#039;t remember how long I prebaked the tart shells!  It&#039;s been a while.  If I were you, I would just do it by eye: they&#039;re ready when they look set and are pale golden.  And don&#039;t worry about the crust drying out when you do the second bake (with the filling).  It&#039;ll be just fine. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;As for silicone tart pans, I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ve never used them.  I use metal ones.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Sorry that I can&#039;t be of more help!  Good luck.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m a big fan of your blog, it&#039;s quite addictive! I&#039;m thinking of giving these a try, but I have a couple of questions about the tartlets. How long should I bake them, in the prebaking phase? Your other recipe (the flan one) recommends 18-20 min, but this one calls for additional baking with the filling, so I&#039;m worried the crust will dry out. Also, do you recommend silicone tart pans? thnx!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there, Maria.  Yep, you could most certainly make the tart shells ahead of time.  You could bake them and then freeze them, and then let them thaw fully before filling them with the lemon mixture. I can&#039;t remember for certain, but the finished tarts might even last a day or two with no adverse effects on their quality.  Give them a test run and see what you think! Good luck to you, and congratulations to your brother.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, Julie, let&#039;s see...I think you could probably go up to about 1 or 2 Tbs of sugar in the crust (rather than the original 1/2 tsp).  It will be an experiment; I&#039;d say try 1 Tbs for a first go.  The dough might be a bit more prone to tearing, but don&#039;t worry.  Just patch it back together and carry on.  Keep me posted!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Carol, I&#039;ve heard that Jeffrey Steingarten&#039;s potato gratin recipe is delicious.  Have you tried it?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Brian, that lemon pudding cake sounds wonderful!  Thanks for the recommendation.  I&#039;ll have to look it up...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Swirl and Sniff, thanks for reporting back.  So glad to hear that the tarts and their wines were a success.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the pairing suggestion -- I ended up going w/a late harvest Sauvignon Blanc and a late harvest Viognier, both of which performed very well.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The recipe proved quite reproducable even w/a few of us baking-challenged wannabe cooks.   Thanks again.]]></description>
