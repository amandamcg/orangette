					<description><![CDATA[Molly-&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned last week that I discovered your blog last summer and that, with time on my hands at the moment, I was going to start reading from the first post. I just wanted to let you know how much I&#039;m loving your writing and your RECIPES! This week I made the whole wheat bread from the ranch (amazing toasted with a little apricot jam!), the zucchini frittata (got a little sloppy when I tried to flip, so think I&#039;ll stick to putting it under the broiler for the last few minutes), the &quot;french-style&quot; scrambled eggs were the creamiest I&#039;ve ever had, and currently my apartment smells AMAZING as I impatiently wait for these pistachio-apricot oatmeal cookies to crispen up! Thanks so much! I&#039;m so thrilled that I still have YEARS of your posts left to read and I can&#039;t wait to choose my next recipe!&lt;br /&gt;~Katie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these, and they are flipping delicious. I don&#039;t know what you said there about the French, but I wonder if it has anything to do with one&#039;s ability to find oats in France?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re cracking me up with the social theorist stuff. I am putting the finishing touches on my own Foucault/Baudrillard/Bourdieu-inspired thesis and have been naughtily reading through your archives as a means of procrastination these last few days.

					<description><![CDATA[I made these cookies today, but substituted hazelnut for the pistachios (salmonella FREAK-OUT!.. at the grocery store at least) I was a little nervous about the flavor combination with the apricots, but it turned out to be just lovely!  Thank you so much for this delightful recipe... and for your hilariously accurate depiction of the throes of academia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little side note: I made your Winning Hearts and Minds  Cake, and I am happy to report... it follows through with its promise.  Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very yummy! I subbed cranberries for the apricots, as they were what I had on hand. Next time I&#039;d probably add just a little more salt. Thanks for the recipe.]]></description>
