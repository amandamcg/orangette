					<description><![CDATA[I know this is a bit belated provided this post was from 2005, however, I am in need of a great chilled soup idea to start a very important dinner party. Would this soup be okay chilled?  Or do you have any other ideas for chilled soup?&lt;br /&gt;thanks!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I loved your DC whirl -- from the culinarily &quot;far too hip&quot; to some serious homey goodness.  I&#039;m about to leave for DC myself, on a yearly biz trip.  I can always count on one good meal at the Tabard Inn...but I&#039;m always looking for other spots.  Know of any Persian places in the Capitol district?]]></description>
