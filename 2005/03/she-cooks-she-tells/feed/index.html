					<description><![CDATA[Bookslut! Bookslut! Bookslut! Heheheee. It could be a conjuration for geeks, said three times fast at night into a mirror while eating only the very best food in one hand and a freshly written thesis, novel, column, or the like in the other. It could be guaranteed to bring forth a smart, geek-sexy person of preferred gender. Just... *poof* Then much swooning.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;As for your writing on Saucy... *much fanfare!* Your work here is fabulous. The column on Saucy was delightful, sad, and delicious all at once. I&#039;m glad to see that someone has recognized your food writing skills and asked for your contribution. That it&#039;s for saucy is even better. Congratulations chica.]]></description>
