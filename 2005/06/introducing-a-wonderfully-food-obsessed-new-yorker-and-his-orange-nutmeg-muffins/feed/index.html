					<description><![CDATA[Hina, to be honest, it&#039;s been a while since I made these muffins, but my recollection is that I don&#039;t pack the brown sugar.  But if you want them to be sweeter, go for it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember the Oberlin Music Cafe! I never tried the muffins, but it was a wonderfully cozy, inviting space, as well as a great place to pick up some staff paper or a cheap Dover piano score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#039;t try the espresso, either, but I can vouch for its popularity: one of my creative writing classes gave an end-of-semester reading there, and you could hardly hear us over the near-constant whir of the coffee grinder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I just pulled a batch of these muffins out of the oven, and they smell terrific. Can&#039;t wait until they cool!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love the taste of these muffins. I juiced the orange and replaced part of the milk with the juice. I also decreased the amount of baking powder to 1 teaspoon and they turned out great and without that aftertaste of baking powder.]]></description>
