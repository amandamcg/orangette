					<description><![CDATA[These were a hit with my family and friends. I never got to thank you for it. I&#039;ve posted a picture of a plate of them on my blog. Thank you! They are a bite of heaven (and a little bit of naughty hell).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been a sporadic reader of your blog for a while now, but never dared to try any of your recipes.  ... as much as it would enlighten my solo cooking adventures, it just never occurred to me.  ... until now.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;A bakery here sells delicious chocolate scones, at a price that&#039;s just slightly too dear for my student budget.  So, intending to cut my costs, and hopefully up my enjoyment, I set out to comb the internet for recipes.  This one jumped out, and I thought &quot;Oh, Orangette, I would be a fool not to try these.&quot;  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And fool I would have been.  They are &lt;&gt;amazing&lt;&gt;, though next time I shall cut them into smaller pieces, since the 8 I did cut them into are FAR TOO BIG even for a lazy Sunday breakfast.  Absolutely delicious, and I can guarantee I shall be trying more of your recipes in the future.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, mav!  After ten days out of town, I&#039;ve been catching up on port2port lately too, and the photos are gorgeous, as always.  Plus, I have a weakness for anything resembling a letter, so reading the exchanges between you and arc is always a highlight of my day.]]></description>
