					<description><![CDATA[Well, Michele, I haven&#039;t seen &lt;&gt;Dodgeball&lt;&gt;, but I&#039;ve seen posters for it, and thankfully, A. looked nothing like Ben Stiller.  Ooof!  The mental image is a good one, though.  [Shudder.]&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Tisane for One, thank you for enlightening me on Nations.  To think that I&#039;ve lived 26 years without eating an enormous breakfast there!  As for Denny&#039;s, I used to go there in high school for (too salty) biscuits (sans gravy) late at night.  The portion size was reasonable in that case, but they were just a side order.  I think the usual &quot;Grand Slam&quot; breakfast (or whatever it&#039;s called) would make me lose my appetite too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;/&gt;Well &#039;Nations&#039; is this Dennys-like joint - you know, monster-sized everything :-) Actually, when I was back in US last year I went to Dennys for breakfast and nearly lost my appetite at seeing the portion sizes - OMG can ONE person really eat all that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;/&gt;love the story! For some reason I picture A. as the character Ben Stiller played in Dodgeball. All coiffed and spandexed and icky.. (Wont I be embarrassed if Im the only one who&#039;s seen that movie..) &lt;/&gt;The larb sounds great, cant wait to try it. The fish sauce didn&#039;t go unnoticed :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tisane for One, that sounds like a much more successful first date than mine!  Mt. Tam is magical indeed.  I have to admit, though, that I don&#039;t know what Nations is.  Do tell!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Susan, larb is one of my favorite simple meals, hands down. And it&#039;s perfect for summer heat. Mmm.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Kathy, I hope you aren&#039;t too worried about A. I have definitely been in situations in which nervousness led me to run at the mouth, but in my experience, an attack of nerves doesn&#039;t forcibly lead to braggadocio. Plus, when larb is nearby, mouths should only be moving to chew! &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Amy, speaking of pizza, we trekked out to DiFara&#039;s (have you been there?) in Brooklyn on Saturday night and had some of the best slices I&#039;ve ever tasted.  Put Otto to shame, even though that fennel-pecorino number was delicious...]]></description>
