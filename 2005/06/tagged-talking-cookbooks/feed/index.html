					<description><![CDATA[At Recollection Books in Seattle, they have a copy of Roy Andries deGroot&#039;s &quot;Auberge of the Flowering Hearth&quot; which while not a cookbook, is such good writing and reading. If you haven&#039;t read it, see if they&#039;ll let you take a look. (they list it for $100.)I read a copy from my podunk local library back in the earlly 70&#039;s and it made me rethink my brown- rice-and-steamed-veggies routine for good! &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;and thanks for the maccaroon recipe. We have a local bakery that makes them and they are my favorite decadent treat. The crunchier on the outside the better, and oh-lala the chocolat!&lt;/&gt;(swoon, swoon)&lt;/&gt;cheers,&lt;/&gt;sue]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oooh, Anonymous, thanks for the hot tip!  It&#039;s almost enough to make me buy a CostCo membership.  Tempting...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Andrea, I knew you&#039;d have&lt;/&gt;good taste in cookbooks.  My parents have that hors d&#039;oeuvres book, and it has a wonderful recipe for little salmon bites dipped in Indian-ish spices and quickly seared.  So delicious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Adrienne, I&#039;m jealous!  You&#039;ll have to keep me posted as you try out various recipes--and in the meantime, I&#039;m going to find out more about this Moe&#039;s place...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Michele, I think you&#039;d like the Chez Panisse books.  If nothing else, they&#039;re very inspiring!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Compmouse, I think I&#039;ve heard of &lt;&gt;The Secret Life of Food&lt;&gt;.  I&#039;ll be sure to look for it the next time I&#039;m in a bookstore.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And k., thanks for the Bill Granger testimonial!  Looks like another cookbook purchase is coming soon...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And margrocks, I know exactly what you mean.  I think part of the Brit-cookbook thing is design--they&#039;re all so beautiful, visually!  Plus, the foods and dishes are spot-on, just the sort of thing we seem to be craving these days.  And as for &lt;&gt;The Joy of Cooking&lt;&gt;, it&#039;s one of my standbys too.  And I&#039;ve had the Angelica Kitchen cornbread in the restaurant itself--damn fine indeed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[something about the brits cookbooks.  don&#039;t know what it is.  i love all nigella, donna hay, and nigel slater books.  when i was in yorkshire in november, i found HOW TO EAT for 2 pounds at the local thrift store.  SCORE.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;in the london bookstores, i wanted to BUY THEM ALL.  i think a trail of saliva followed me out of the bookstore.  can&#039;t explain why i find them superior  to most american cookbooks, perhaps the Brits just so grateful that they&#039;ve awoken from the culinary Dark Ages, they tend &quot;do it up right.&quot;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;[now that i think about it, donna hay is australian, but whatever...my point still stands.  love the brits&#039; (and their descendants&#039;) culinary tomes.]&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;my standbys...joy of cooking, angelica&#039;s kitchen cookbook (best damn vegan cornbread you&#039;ll ever eat), my mom&#039;s brown tupperware recipe box filled with tons of casserole and cookie recipes, and MY binder w/ all my clippings + whatnot.]]></description>
