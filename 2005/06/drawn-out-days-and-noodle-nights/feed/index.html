					<description><![CDATA[I have had this bookmarked for years, and never seemed to get around to trying it. The other night I made it for my boyfriend after he had been working hard on a project all day and he was so excited when he saw it. We absolutely loved it and agreed that it will have to enter our regular rotation. Thank you so much for sharing another great recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I remember seeing this recipe on your blog back when you first posted it.  I was 19 then and completely unfamiliar with eggplant, but I remember seeing your photos and deciding I had to try this dish.  I made it and loved it, and 4 years later I&#039;m a bonafide foodie and loved it just as much when I made it recently.  In my opinion, eggplant is one of the most perfect foods, so thanks for helping to open my eyes to that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LOVED this! Seriously, loved it.&lt;/&gt;My hubbie and I decided that we need to eat it at least once a week, and that says a lot. Once again, another fabulous recipe from your blog.&lt;/&gt;THANK YOU!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tried this the other night. I could only get regular eggplant and had to do without the sprouts, but it was ok. I halved the recipe and still have a big bowl left in my fridge! I thought it was ok, but the eggplant really absorbed the dressing, making bites of it a bit too strong. This was my first experience with eggplant really, and I don&#039;t know if I really dig the texture...is that just how eggplant is, or are there other ways of preparing it? My husband didn&#039;t like it much; it was a salad of things he doesn&#039;t really like. Bummer. I have a hard time thinking of meals he&#039;ll enjoy without heating up the kitchen in the summer and weighing down our tummies with hearty, heavy foods. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll make this again, but I guess I do have a question regarding the eggplant: what am I supposed to do with the seeds? I tried to get as many of them out of &amp; off the pieces of flesh as I could, but are we supposed to eat them?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gemma, this week&#039;s weather has been a bit temperamental, but today is sunny with a high of 72.  Ahhh.  Hurry on over!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Lisa, thank you!  I&#039;m blushing. And I&#039;m so glad to hear that you liked--or rather, &lt;&gt;loved&lt;&gt;--the noodles, and your substitutions sound perfect. Enjoy those leftovers...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my &lt;&gt;god&lt;&gt;, Molly, can I marry you?  Please?  I&#039;m not sure what my boyfriend will think, but no matter ...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I made this yesterday for a big lunch we had, with 15 people, and I really think it was the most delicious thing I have ever made, no exaggeration.  I tripled the recipe, which was more than adequate, but all the better since now there are leftovers, flavors melding deliciously in the fridge till I descend upon them in an hour!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I substituted regular eggplant, which worked just fine, although of course it took a bit longer to roast.  I substituted some julienned zucchini for the snowpeas (I couldn&#039;t bear to buy the tired dry shrink-wrapped peas at the deli.  I felt like the crunchy sweet snap peas which are like kudzu right now at the farmers market might descend upon me with swords while I slept, if they discovered my betrayal.) which was tasty tasty.  I added some julienned fresh red pepper too.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You&#039;re right, it wasn&#039;t very complicated, and the boiling and cooling of the pasta and the roasting of the eggplant leaves ample time for all the veggie prep.  But it was quite labor-intensive -- and more so, of course, because I was chopping triple the veggies.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I try out lots of recipes from lots of food blogs, and it&#039;s always a joyful ride, but you should know that the recipes you share are, without exception, my favorites.  I don&#039;t know you but I trust your goût completely.  Thank you!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;peace&lt;/&gt;Lisa]]></description>
