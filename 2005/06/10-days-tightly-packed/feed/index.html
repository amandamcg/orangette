					<description><![CDATA[Molly, your blog has a wonderful title!  And I&#039;m so glad to hear that you are a fellow radish lover--looks we have more in common than just a name.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;How funny, kath red.  Only a few hours before you left your comment, I was perusing your blog--and got there via port2port!  Your cupcakes and mud oven pizzas look fantastic...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And gemma, I look forward to it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly - I recently discovered your blog and have thus been an engrossed reader!  It has been quite fun and interesting (in the manner of a food-loving fly on the wall) to read about the connections and meetings amongst the food blogging world in nyc in the past week or so.  And I was so inspired by the radish post linked in this entry (a new way to eat a radish for me, and quite delicious) that I wrote about it on my own fledgling food blog.  Thanks!  -Molly (also)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How fun for you and Melissa, Michele!  Although I&#039;ve always been sheepish of the idea of &quot;meeting people on the Internet,&quot; I must admit that blogging has made it an absolute pleasure.  I imagine you&#039;d agree...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Maria, you were just recently in NYC, right?  As I recall, you took some lovely photos too (as usual, of course)!  It&#039;s only a matter of time until we run into each other there, don&#039;t you think?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Amy, dim sum it is!  And don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ll find a way to get to Malmo for the herring (vegetarian or no) at some point too.  Oh, and I&#039;m not surprised to hear that you&#039;re also a fan of Sabra--I knew you were a woman of taste.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;TanTian, I&#039;m going to take you up on your Sahadi&#039;s suggestion, most definitely.  Hot damn.  Expect to hear from me this fall!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Margrocks, ohhh yes, those pine nuts and herbs!  Although I do love homemade hummus, there&#039;s something about those folks at Sabra.  And as for Centerport, it&#039;s on Long Island.  I&#039;m not sure my sister is ready to take on a sixth, but maybe you can make a day trip?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tisane for One, rosewater marshmallows are certainly quiver-worthy!  And as for hummus, I recently posted my favorite recipe (using white beans rather than chickpeas, so it&#039;s not strictly traditional, but sooooo smooth) right &lt; HREF=&quot;http://orangette.blogspot.com/2005/05/little-family-large-appetite.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;&gt;.  As a matter of fact, I know that Amy made it recently, so maybe you two can swap notes when you&#039;re in Scandinavia...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Chocopie, thank you!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Gemma, I hope you had a wonderful trip to NY, with, of course, wonderful food.  Will you be writing about it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It sounds like you had a great time in NY.  I just returned yesterday from a brief trip there as well and I come to find out the place was crawling with food-bloggers!

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Molly,&lt;/&gt;Your trip sounds fantastic - what a great time you must have had and I bet you probably needed a holiday after it ended - as is usually the case when excellent trips hapen to excellent people. Your mention of rosewater marshmallows made me quiver in my seat...mallows are my greatest sweet weakness.&lt;/&gt;And I am also a sucker for great hummus - How about posting a good hummus recipe?&lt;/&gt;Glad to hear you had a great time with Amy, I hope I can meet her when I am in Denmark later this year...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amy, you beat me to the punch.  I was about to leave my own comment about the unbelievable tastiness of Sabra hummus.  I hope you bought the party size, Molly!  Next time you are in NYC we&#039;ll have to hit up Sahadi&#039;s. (www.sahadifinefoods.com)]]></description>
