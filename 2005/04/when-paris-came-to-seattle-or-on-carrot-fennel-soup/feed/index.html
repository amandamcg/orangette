					<description><![CDATA[in one of those moments of serendipity, my fridge contained the exact ingredients for this lovey soup. I was a little nervous about adding the orange juice, but i did. And i am very glad of this, because the hint of orange that comes through with every slurp is a delicious surprise...thanks for a wonderful recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tried this tonight, and I felt I was violating your tenet from the book about following the recipe to the letter the first time you try it--I forgot to buy veggie broth, so I used chicken broth instead, and I decided to chance skipping the creme fraiche. I think the chicken broth was an okay move, but it probably could&#039;ve used the creme fraiche. Instead I gave it some tang by adding some white wine vinegar. Now I&#039;m wishing I had followed the recipe. :o) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also wanted to tell you how much I loved your book, and I was touched by how you were able to put into words some things I have felt about food but never could quite articulate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How funny!  I just made this soup again the other day, for the first time in about a year, and I made a few tweaks, so I decide to update the recipe online.  It must have triggered something in your Bloglines, or whatever aggregator you use, Alice Q. and wheresmymind!  I saw your comments and thought, &quot;What weird timing!  I just updated this two-year-old post, and lo and behold, it gets new comments!&quot;  It didn&#039;t occur to me until this morning that it probably showed up in your aggregator as a new post, eh?  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Either way, you really should try the soup!  It&#039;s perfect for this time of year, and so, so good with a bit of creme fraiche!  I&#039;ve been eating it for lunch all week...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How fun!  I love Pikes Place Market, and I am determined to someday do a stay in Paris like yours.  It&#039;s one of those &quot;to do before you die&quot; kind of things I think - or at least it&#039;s one of mine!  I made the &quot;rancho la puerta&quot; granola that I found on your recipe list the other day and I am planning to post about it - I love it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A bit late, but still worth a post: I put &quot;fennel soup&quot; into Google this evening to see what I could do new with the fennel bulb I had and this recipe came up. Delicious! I&#039;ll definitely be making this again. Maybe double the quantity, but otherwise the same. Greetings from Cambridge UK, I might take a browse around and see what else I can find we&#039;d like here. Thanks again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Posthipchick, I appreciate your concern, and I&#039;m happy to clarify that what you&#039;re seeing is most thankfully NOT a hair--it&#039;s a wispy bit of fennel frond.  See recipe for details. Phew.]]></description>
