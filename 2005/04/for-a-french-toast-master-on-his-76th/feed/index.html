					<description><![CDATA[Craving French Toast and feeling nostalgic for my departed Pops, I recalled your dad&#039;s recipe in your book and promptly made it this AM. Perfection. I&#039;ve never quite &quot;nailed&quot; French Toast; now I have. Thank you Molly and Burg. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read your book, then found your blog, and this morning I made your Dads French toast. It was so delicious....and I will make it for my dad next time I get a chance...My dad Bill used to make us chorizo and eggs and potatoes on Sat mornings...he also would make us jelly omelets with my grandmas boysenberry jam. Not sure if that&#039;s a real thing or something he made up...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I must say that I am a fan of Berg&#039;s French toast, but I have my own twist and I&#039;m curious to see other&#039;s French Toast aficionado&#039;s opinion..... instead of 1 tsp of Vanilla, I double it to 2 tsps of vanilla and add 2 tsp of Almond (or more depending on my modd)! I happened to come across this &quot;Amaretto&quot; taste when I was eating French toast at the once popular Larry&#039;s Market Cafe (RIP). Ever since that first bite, I&#039;ve been in search of the recipe. I asked the chef what her secret was and she said Amaretto. But Berg&#039;s recipe is by far the closest to French Toast perfection once I add my Amaretto flavor. Ahhhhh....a pefect Saturday morning breakfast. Or Wednesday dinner, or Sunday&#039;s lunch reheats. Amy Turnnbull Ballard, Wa]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love IS lovlier the second time around and I wanted to make some-thing very special for  the special man in my life this weekend.We are both 73 going on 16! I have been searching - and when I read your comments about your Dad along with the recipe to fry the toast in oil - I was convinced that I had found something delicious and special. Remembering back, I think my mother used to fry the toast for us because I remember the old cast iron skillet she used. Thanks for sharing your wonderful memories of your Dad and for helping me recall a lovely rememberance from my childhood. And - thanks for the wonderful recipe.]]></description>
