					<description><![CDATA[Lauren, I&#039;m not sure what to tell you!  I got this recipe from Jimmy and haven&#039;t made them myself, so I&#039;m not sure if you should let the dough come to room temperature / do a second proof before frying.  If I were you, I might look up other beignet recipes and see what they say.  Sorry I can&#039;t be more helpful...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These look and sound fantastic! Just a question, do you let the dough come to room temp after its overnight proof/allow it a second proof before frying?&lt;/&gt;Can&#039;t wait to make them :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Frolic, thank you for helping me learn to stop worrying and love my powdered-sugared pants.  You&#039;re right: shame is highly overrated!  Come to think of it, I&#039;m surprised that the word is even in Rebecca&#039;s vocabulary...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looks like you did these right, but I&#039;m just mystified by all this talk of &quot;shame.&quot; Lighten up! This is a New Orleans dish. The entire city would grind to a halt if we worried much about &quot;shame.&quot;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And don&#039;t listen to your friend about the proper way to eat beignets. In my experience, beignets are best eaten early in the morning when an out-of-town visitor has dragged you to Bourbon Street. You can&#039;t walk through Bourbon Street without ruining a pair a shoes and permanently staining the cuffs of your pants. A little powdered sugar is the least of your cleaning concerns.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, shame on me! It must be my Mexican-Jewish background, but we make these, sometimes yeast-risen, sometimes baking-powder-risen, and while they&#039;r hot, bite a corner off and pour honey into them. Honey, powdered sugar - it&#039;s still a sugar rush.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Your Unc from Maine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tara, you&#039;ve got it exactly right.  The beignets were miraculously both decadent and light!  Jimmy is truly a master.  But now that you&#039;ve got the recipe, mastery will soon be yours as well!  Oh, and very glad to hear about the asparagus...I have a few spears waiting in my fridge right now, actually.  Yum.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Sammy, sorry to hear that.  I suppose you&#039;ve learned your lesson, though?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Rebecca, dear, you are always too too, just too much!  I can hardly wait until next Sunday--although without any sugar, whatever will I write about?  Oh, and WHEN is my manicure?  I know how you feel about my cuticles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Little Bird, how precious of you to write with such passion about our recent Sunday sugar worship.  But we can&#039;t dwell on the past to terribly long, now can we?  I think not.  There&#039;s cane being hacked as we live and breath so we must focus on the future and what&#039;s next.  Speaking of which, Jimmy&#039;s finalized the menu for next Sunday and although there will be hardly any sugar present, (damn it) the fat, the sacred fat, will be more extreme than ever.  And did I mention salt?  The fat and the salt . . . I suggest not eating from Friday on.  See you soon, sweet girl.]]></description>
