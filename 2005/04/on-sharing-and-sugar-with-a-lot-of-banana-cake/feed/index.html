					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Im not a expert baker, but this sounds so delicious that i&#039;m thinking of baking this for my son&#039;s birthday. As far as the ingredients go, how many gms is a cup measure. What sort of cup are you using? I really require an answer as soon as possible so thanks in advance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for an excellent looking cake, with chocolate!!! and most of all for putting a weight for the bananas.  I grow finger bananas, not nearly as big as in the store, and it is so frustrating to try to use them up in baking when directions only say &quot;two bananas&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I baked this cake with my godson yesterday. We had a ton of fun in the process. I always try to cook or bake something with him. And yesterday was perfect for that, seeing as Seattle shut down due to snow. There are times when he doesn&#039;t feel like helping, so I&#039;ll subtly ask him to taste test and adjust to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ganache was easy to make and turned out perfect. Unfortunately, I used all purpose flour instead of cake flour, which resulted in a dumbed down flavor in the cake. I was pretty sad. But my godson is 10, baked the cake from the beginning to end, and was very proud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would have turned out great had I understood the difference between cake flour and all purpose flour - and adjusted accordingly as you stated in your later comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I&#039;m hosting a dinner party with my girlfriends and am trying your other banana cake recipe, adapted from Gourmet. I am baking the bananas in their skin before I puree them. I read that this method will result in a lemony flavor, which I think will go well. I&#039;ll report back on your other recipe with how it turns out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, always, for inspiring me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mixed up the banana cake Saturday night and it was  HUGE success, the cake and ganache balance each other perfectly, I doubled the recipe (my God that was a lot of butter) and made a two layer cake, if I could upload a picture here I would, because it was gloriously beautiful and almost gone in less than two hours (two people actually had dessert before AND after our meal) - I actually woke up to my husband having it for breakfast this morning - so THANK you for this recipe it took a little while with the food processor and all but was well worth the effort!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Getting ready to mix up this banana cake in my kitchen right now - I have no experience outside my kitchen, my husband the chef does not enjoy baking but will offer his sage advice when I embark.  I&#039;ve been a confirmed bake from scratch cake maker since the first year he and I were together and he boasted that my buttermilk German chocolate homemade icing cake was better than his German godmother&#039;s, hoping mine turns out as well as yours, I&#039;m doubling the recipe to make it a layer cake thus doubling the ganache - let&#039;s see how this goes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this recipe for my husband&#039;s 30th birthday and it was absolutely delicious. It was so moist and the ganache glaze was the perfect accompaniment. I accidentally baked it in my 10&quot; springform pan and was worried that would have a negative effect on the outcome but my worries were misplaced. Thank you for sharing what will certainly become a staple in my baking repertoire!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to work in a cafe, and the banana cake we made there was hands down one of my favourite desserts ever. Unfortunately, I failed to take the recipe with me when I left. Regrets, I&#039;ve had a few...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the main idea of the cake was a not-too-sweet banana cake with dark or bittersweet chocolate chips folded into the batter, and then split into layers to make a layer cake. In between the layers, rather than dark chocolate choclate ganache, it had a thin layer of white chocolate ganache. And then covering the whole thing was some magical white chocolate ganache whipped cream. The whipped cream element helped to prevent it from becoming too sweet and cloying. While not being a huge white chocolate fan, somehow it just works brilliantly with the banana, reminding me slightly of the banana milkshakes my mom used to make for my dad and I once in a blue moon, if we were very, very good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was best the next day, when some of the flavours had had a chance to meld and soften. It was like a banana-flavoured cloud with chocolate chips thrown in for good measure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe I&#039;ll have to snag your recipe, Molly, and start experimenting.]]></description>
