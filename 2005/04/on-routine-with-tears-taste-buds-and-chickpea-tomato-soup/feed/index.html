					<description><![CDATA[I just had to comment tonight because I felt like I owed you a thank you. I began making this soup for my husband when I found it on your blog years ago on a cold rainy day in San Francisco. He quickly declared it his favorite soup ever and I have probably made it at least 50 times since, only now I am making it in snowy Chicago where a warm bowl of this soup can brighten any dreary day. I don&#039;t change a thing. The only thing this soup requires is a good drizzle of quality olive oil over the top and a really crusty baguette on the side. We love it, so thank you for this!&lt;br /&gt;-Abby]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fallen hard for this soup. I make it every week in Winter. Right now it&#039;s mid Summer and 30 degrees Celsius in my city and I just finished two generous helpings of it - it&#039;s just as good in the heat. Thanks so much for sharing!]]></description>

Don&#039;t expect much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.learackley.com/?p=374&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the inspiration :)]]></description>
