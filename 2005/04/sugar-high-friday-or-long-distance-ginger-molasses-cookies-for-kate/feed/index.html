					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I had one of these cookies at your book signing today on Orcas Island.  I was told it was a Macrina Bakery recipe. My favorite ginger cookie recipe is from the now closed Stars restaurant in SF.  I could have sworn it was the same recipe. I had the ginger cookies at Stars,warm out of the oven, and immediately went out an bought Emily Luchetti&#039;s Stars Desserts cookbook.  OK, why am I telling you this?  I now feel I need to have a ginger cookie bakeoff!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So very late to this party, but I wanted to thank you for this recipe...these cookies are amazing. I&#039;ve had requests from friends, wanting me to make them a batch. I&#039;ve started using them to make ice cream sandwiches...very very nice. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know it&#039;s been a month since you posted the recipe for these cookies, but I just tried this today. WONDERFUL! My husband - who usually only eats cookies he knows and knows he&#039;ll like - ate a bunch right out of the oven! :) Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Anonymous!  Funny, though...this post was actually part of Sugar High Fridays, one of those food-blogging events!  I don&#039;t take part in many of them, but occasionally they call for an ingredient or a technique that I want to play with anyway, such as this case.  But no matter what I&#039;m writing about, or what I&#039;m writing for, I try to keep my &quot;storyline&quot; in the fore, as opposed to, say, the themed event that may have inspired the post.  Either way, thank you for the generous compliment!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, can I just tell you that I am so pleased you don&#039;t participate in the themed food blog events? After scrolling (more like scanning) through other blogs, I&#039;m always so happy to come back to your originality. (And not have to read about oranges again.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Zarah Maria, I&#039;m glad we got that straightened out, and how terrific that Amazon delivers in Denmark!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Suzanne, thank you so, so much for your very generous compliments!  I&#039;m honored to know that your students are reading Orangette.  This site truly is a labor of love, and the payoffs have been greater that I would have ever dared to imagine!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I have been reading your blog for several weeks now and adore your writing, yummy recipes and spectacular pictures.  I&#039;m a placement director for a culinary school in the Southeast and have several students interested in food styling and journalism.  I have encouraged them to look to your blog as an example of incredible writing and delightful, intriguing pictures that rival some of the best professional chef mags out there.  Keep up the good work and inspiring the chefs of tomorrow!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Suzanne]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Guess I&#039;m not the sharpest knife in the knife block - Geez! I never realized it was linked, and yes, amazon delivers in Denmark - unfortunately? Fortunately? :-) Thank you for pointing me in the right direction Molly, it&#039;s on my wishlist now, despite the &quot;missing&quot; pictures in it - guess I can just stop by here and have a look at the finished results!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, Zarah Maria, I&#039;m not sure how you can get a copy of the cookbook.  Does Amazon or anything similar operate in Denmark?  Hmmm.  As for photos, I&#039;m sorry to say that there aren&#039;t too many--and they&#039;re all all black and white and small.  Hmph!  But the recipes are spectacular.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nic., as for Easy Spirits, Kate&#039;s really are quite chic, actually.  Little black round-toed heels.  It&#039;s just the *idea* of Easy Spirits that is bad, really.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;E, your Sunday sounds delicious!  As for other suggestions, hmmm, well, I love everything I write about, so I&#039;m hard-pressed to choose favorites.  Have you checked out my &lt; HREF=&quot;http://recipesorangette.blogspot.com/&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;recipe index&lt;&gt;?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Cathy, yes, go look at the book.  It has some great bread recipes as well, and I also adore their chocolate and apricot cookies.  Mmmm.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Julie, let me know what you think!  And three cheers for muscovado!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Kate, ma fourchette preferee, je suis tellement contente de te trouver ici!  Je peux bien t&#039;imaginer sur une moto...c&#039;etait le &quot;700-lb hog,&quot; non?  Je peux toujours compter sur toi pour rapporter des droles d&#039;histoires.  Je t&#039;adore, comme d&#039;habitude.]]></description>
