					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very much a late-comer to the Orangette party, having impulse-purchased your book on one of those &quot;I-need-something-new-in-my-life&quot; days, as much for the color combination on the cover as for the content inside. Fortunately, I wasn&#039;t disappointed. I fell in love with your quirkiness, warmth, and food descriptions immediately as I discovered yet another writer who magically writes the way I think. Discovering that you have an entire blog full of such stories and recipes is really just the proverbial icing on the cake. I&#039;ve been undertaking the mission of reading through the archives on slow afternoons, and today, I arrived here at your asparagus recipe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the many ways I enjoy my asparagus, but it took much coaxing for me to get there. In the beginning, I could eat it only one way, and I find that way is still my favorite, worth sharing: lightly coated with olive oil and (strangely) raw sugar, then quickly sauteed in a very hot pan on the stove. The sugar forms a nice little crust that acts very similarly to your roasting process, locking in the flavor but also adding a bit of sweetness to the concentrated, sometimes pungent green-ness (yes, I think things taste like colors) of the asparagus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for sharing your food/life (is there a difference?) with us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had to let you know that I made this asparagus tonight and it was a revelation.... My family has always been a vegetable-steaming family, and asparagus was always cooked that way, with butter and salt after cooking, so for years I never even conceived of cooking it a different way.&lt;/&gt;Now that I&#039;ve left the familial nest and asparagus is finally a decent price at the Toulouse marchÃ© du boulevard Strasbourg, I&#039;ve had the chance to rebell against my upbringing. It was the best asparagus I&#039;ve ever had, and I&#039;ve sent this link to my parents in hope they might break with tradition and give it a go.&lt;/&gt;I suddenly feel like a vegetable evangelist.&lt;/&gt;Keep up the fabulous writing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazing, I&#039;m glad I&#039;ve found another asparagus aficionado, truly the best vegetable of the season. I&#039;ve been thinking about trying it with some kind of anchovy paste, but really, there&#039;s not much you can do to improve fresh asparagus on its own!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this, Molly. I too love roasted asparagus but last time I made it I drew a total blank as to how long I should have it in there and ended up totally killing it. The asparagus shrivels not only looks unapetzing on the plate, they lost their taste.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Now if MalmÃ¶ would just get on the ball. Asparagus isn&#039;t overflowing the shelves here like it seems to be doing everywhere else.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loving your writing - I hope you&#039;ll never get tired of hearing that, &#039;cause I&#039;m gonna abuse the sentence a couple more times, I&#039;m sure. We had the loveliest day here today, and ta-dah: asparagus at the market. I grilled mine on a grill pan - lovely! But will of course have to try  roasting them soon. Oh, and then I have to try Seattle, too!:-)]]></description>
