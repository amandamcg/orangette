					<description><![CDATA[I love cabbage, and just learning the best ways to prepare it. Just a note: corned beef and cabbage did not come out of Ireland. That is an Irish American dish because Irish immigrants could not afford pork and settled for cured beef that was cheap and easy to get. I am Irish heritage and I refuse to eat corned beef.  When I cook Irish dishes I prefer pork, but salmon and lamb are also classic Irish meats.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I chastised my mom a while back for having never in my entire life fed me a brussels sprout, being that she&#039;s not a fan herself. It was only after reading your entry about the cream braised version that I decided to give them a whirl, and as my roommates can attest, I was pretty well obsessed for a while there. Then yesterday I perused THIS entry, and later when faced with the &quot;stare into the fridge, find something for dinner&quot; conundrum, I spied a fresh bag of sprouts, an apple, and a sweet onion. I sort of remembered the recipe for the sauteed cabbage, improvised, and a new obsession was born! It&#039;s a good thing, because it was getting hard to justify the regular consumption of heavy cream by how healthy the brussels sprouts are.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Molly, I have been reading through your archives, and as an anthropology grad student I found your Bourdieu and Foucault references hysterical!  I love your writing, your ideas, and most of all, your random ethnographic references-- keep up the great work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You have converted a former non-believer.  I just finished making the braised red cabbage with apple and caraway, and it is DELISH! Who knew the unglamorous cabbage could be so tender, so lovely, so sweet? &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I shall now join you in defending cabbage to the death. To the death!]]></description>
