					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve made this soup so many times, and always marvel: how can vegetables plus broth plus salt = magnificent? I think of it as Fretwell Mystery Soup. Thanks for sharing it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, the soup is simmering silently on the oven, it is already delicious and I canÂ´t wait to declare it ready ... and IÂ´m looking for the (generous) leftovers tomorrow, I think soup is always better after a night of rest ... sometimes IÂ´m organized enough to plan a day ahead, but not today ... thanks for the great recipe, thanks to the Fretwells too, for the recipe and for caring so much ... best wishes, eva]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, I just had to comment on this post from years ago, which I&#039;m not sre how I stumbled on, but which made me very excited when I saw the name Fretwell- that&#039;s my name! I&#039;ve never met another Fretwell that I didn&#039;t already know I was related to. I think I&#039;ll make this soup for my family, just to tell them it comes form the Oklahoma Fretwells. Plus, it does sound good. Hello to your old family friends from the Atlanta branch...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a lovely soup recipe - made it tonight on a cold, grey day and it warmed our family up and brightened our day.  Used the last bit of fresh sage from our herb garden.  Thank you so much for bringing such joy into our day.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharon]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the soup! Turned out great for a rainy Tokyo night. Houseguests were pleased. Topped it off with the ginger cake from epicurious that you mentioned in an earlier post (though the more highly rated David Lebovitz version looks amazing too! next time...) and that topped with whipped cream. Yes! Anything that calls for cream, sign me up...]]></description>
