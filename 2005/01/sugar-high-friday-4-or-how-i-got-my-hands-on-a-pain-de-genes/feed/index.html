I love almond paste. So here I am. Now, what happened to Michael and Becky?  What did you do in Paris?  I&#039;m wondering if this cake can be made with almond flour?

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;br /&gt;I am so good at following recipes but lack the creativity of coming up with my own recipes :-( However, I always modify recipes - does that count? I promise to post a really good recipe for some tarts I made last week though :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;As usual, I am hungry by the time I finish reading your post. The cake sounds divine!&lt;br /&gt;Now, here is an interesting observation. Here in OZ I have been telling people FOR YEARS about chicken in Coca-cola and beans cooked in beer. People look at me like I need to get some &#039;professional help&#039; - I am so glad you have validated my memories of such food - I know I was not &#039;seriously tripping&#039; :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the compliments, ladies!  If you like almond paste and appreciate simple, tea-type cakes, this is a don&#039;t-miss.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thanks for the pointers, Debbie, re: copyright!  No physical violence will be necessary.  I&#039;ve been torn for a while now about printing recipes that, in some cases, I&#039;ve only adapted in tiny ways, and I haven&#039;t found a solid solution.  But I, like you, am always peeved when someone gushes over a dish and then doesn&#039;t offer a recipe.  So it&#039;s official: although I&#039;ll carefully consider each case, I&#039;m going with your guidelines.  It just makes sense.  Policy enacted!  See above for the recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a great post! Citroens, Adrienne Rich, and cake all in one story, and the photo is gorgeous. I could strangle you for not posting the recipe, though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I used to work at a major publisher of cookbooks, btw, and my understanding is that as long as you credit the book/author it&#039;s ok to provide a recipe or two. Most savvy publishers realize it&#039;s good marketing for their books.)]]></description>
