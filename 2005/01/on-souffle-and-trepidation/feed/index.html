					<description><![CDATA[I have plans for after I retire. I figure I&#039;ll buy a little building, live in the 2nd floor, and have my bookstore on the 1st. The bookstore will carry only two types of books--cookbooks and poetry. Reading your blog makes me believe that idea is not so crazy after all.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly and all francophile readers,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I just thought that this belated post might help those who are just catching up on the blog (like me!) and who love souffle (like me!).  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;In Paris (7ieme) there is the most amazing souffle restaurant - La Cigale - that serves savory and dessert souffles to die for (or kill for, depending on your temperament).  Highly recommended:&lt;/&gt;http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/France/Ile_de_France/Paris-99080/Restaurants-Paris-La_Cigale-BR-1.html&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Katharine]]></description>
