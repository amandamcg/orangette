					<description><![CDATA[I made this last night - I was time pour so used a rotisserie chicken and then also added peas at the end. Don&#039;t know whether to describe it as a soupy pasta (I went a little overboard on the pasta front I think) or a stewy soup with pasta, but whatever it was it was delicious, and my sick boyfriend was very appreciative of its nourishing qualities. And leftovers will keep us fed for days! Will definitely be making again. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I made this today, using brown rice instead of pasta. I cooked it for about 45 minutes, for the rice to soak up the broth. It thickened up quite well. I also added a bit of fresh ginger to it as well, since ginger is supposed to help with colds. Let&#039;s hope it helps mine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How lovely to see oliebollen on your blog. They&#039;re one of those things I wish I could eat all year, but after Jan 1st, they&#039;re a rare sight. &lt;/&gt;In Holland you can also buy them at stands which are set up during the time around Christmas and New Year. You have a choice of plain, or made with currants. And that with a dusting of powdered sugar, is heaven.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Beth, I&#039;m so glad you liked it!  I just bought some leeks the other day to make this soup.  There must be something in the air!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;But as for the problem you mentioned with the liquid, I&#039;m not sure what to tell you.  Mine doesn&#039;t really thicken either - it&#039;s fairly brothy.  Because it has lots of chunky nubs of chicken and leeks and tiny pasta, I thought it was more appropriate to call it a stew, but maybe that&#039;s misleading?  It&#039;s not as thick as what you might think of as a typical stew...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently tried your &quot;chicken stew with a secret weapon&quot; recipe and loved it. However, the liquid never thickened at all. The only small pasta I had around was orzo. Can that be the problem? Do other types of pasta render more starch?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for visiting, Abbey!  Let me know how you like the soup!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just for the record, despite our closeness and his many lovely qualities, Nicho is currently single!  That’s what made the Vicki’s Secret box so suspicious.  Ladies, take heed.  I’ve got his phone number if you need it…]]></description>
