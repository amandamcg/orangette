					<description><![CDATA[Mark, any idea where I can get my hands on a custard apple?  The name alone is pretty dreamy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Viv, yes, wouldn&#039;t you say it&#039;s something about *Seattle*?  I mean, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pusekatt, no progress yet on the dukkah, I&#039;m sorry to report.  It&#039;s been a busy week.  Sigh.  I&#039;ve really got to get my priorities in order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave, your 22-month-old sounds like quite the champ herself!  It must be fun to watch her tastes change, although I imagine it might also be frustrating?  Since I was something of a food scaredy-cat (or at least not very fun about food) as a kid, I think my father would be *thrilled* to see me now.  I&#039;m sure your daughter is on her way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Thomas, Jenny, and wee Eero, YOU are wonderful.  I hope the leftovers were tasty...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pretty adventurous kid.  My 22-month old had pasta w/ sweet italian sausage in tomato sauce, a handful of roasted soybeans, an apple and some raisins last night.  This array was a little unusual, she usually likes things uncooked.  But, her preferences change daily.]]></description>

Wow, I think at that age I was happy eating a mashed banana, hehe.&lt;br /&gt;The nibbles sounded delicious...I adore salmon.&lt;br /&gt;I will be on the lookout for the name Eero as a future chef...&lt;br /&gt;BTW, any progress on the Dukkah?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow! Eero doesn&#039;t even sound human! If he doesn&#039;t grow up to become a Michelin stared chef, I&#039;ll be amazed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And talking of chocolate apples, there is always the &#039;chocolate pudding fruit&#039; (&lt;&gt;Diospyros digyna&lt;&gt;), which I believe is grown in Hawaii where it is known as the black persimmon. It is the size of a small apple and under it&#039;s green skin has flesh which is soft, sweet, and dark-chocolate coloured! It doesn&#039;t taste of much though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another fruit which intrigues me is the custard apple, which has white flesh which is supposed to have a sweet/sour flavour reminiscent of bananas and pineapples. Oh, the joy of fruit!]]></description>
