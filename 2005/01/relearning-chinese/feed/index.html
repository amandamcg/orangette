					<description><![CDATA[YES!!  Shanghai Garden!!  &lt;br /&gt;my daughter and i were down in Seattle earlier this spring to see Lily Allen and wanted to eat out beforehand.  ended up wandering around for what felt like &lt;i&gt;hours&lt;/i&gt; and ended up in the International District.  stumbled upon this (what i thought was) dodgy looking chinese restaurant. &lt;br /&gt;we ordered the hand shaved chicken chow mein and the ginger (or maybe tangerine?) beef -- soooo delicious!!  i think between the two of us, we finished everything!!  &lt;br /&gt;loved it so much, we wanted to take my husband and son back there for dinner.  in fact, made us wish we lived in seattle so we could visit more often.  now we&#039;ll have &lt;b&gt;two&lt;/b&gt; places to visit next time we&#039;re down there :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, as a new discoverer of your blog - thanks to my aforementioned teenage daughter who discovered you reading &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; &#039;bon appetit&#039;, i have a bone  to pick with you.... i do not enjoy the same willpower of which you boast; those chocolate covered macaroons with do me in for sure!!!!!

					<description><![CDATA[Amy, I will do my best to eat enough dumplings for both of us!  And don&#039;t worry--I&#039;ll seek out scallion pancakes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emmeya, thanks for stopping by!  I hope your dumplings were tasty...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Kate, dahhhlink, I can think of no better co-adventuress than you.  That was definitely one of our finer nights, from eye twitches to the &quot;shag&quot; setting on the vacuum.  And thank you for giving Pusekatt the lowdown on dim sum, since you&#039;re much more in-the-know than I am...]]></description>
