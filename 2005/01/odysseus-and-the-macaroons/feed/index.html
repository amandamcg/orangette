					<description><![CDATA[This recipe makes such sweet and moist macaroons - and they come out perfectly every time. I&#039;d  never made them at home thinking they were far too fussy for me, but after reading your book and finding this recipe on your blog, I finally took at stab at them and was pleasantly surprised. Thank you for sharing this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[you are so right about the macaroons at Max&#039;s. When describing them, I say they are the size of a small Nerf football. Too many times I have eaten there and ordered one for dessert, intending to eat half and take the rest home and ending up going home with nothing (I am a 6&#039;3&quot; 250 lb. male). I have been searching for a recipe that would give me that same dense chewy consistency.  I will try this recipe because you are a fan of Max&#039;s. Look forward to the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these for Passover and people INHALED them. Even my beau, who claims to hate coconut, loved them. These macaroons were one of the most delicious (and easiest) baked goods I&#039;ve ever made. I doubled the recipe and used bittersweet chocolate for dipping, which tasted wonderful. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly - these are astonishingly good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;ve made five batches in the last week and a half or so, making little tweaks as I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My changes/adjustments as time has gone on have been mostly related to perfecting the crispy exterior:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#039;m happier with the &#039;dough&#039; chilled longer than 30 minutes (overnight worked out great) - the colder coconut/meringue mix resulted in a slightly crispier outside to the macaroon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hand-rolling a ball and then pressing it semi-flat has given me the best mix of a smooth (evenly crisp-able) exterior with just enough texture to be interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- With the above two tweaks, I&#039;m able to bake it a little longer - generally about 36-37 minutes - and get a really spectacular crispness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other part I&#039;ve experimented with is applying the ganache; some people found that the dipped macaroons were a little too chocolaty for their tastes.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Molly &#8211; these are astonishingly good!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made five batches in the last week and a half or so, making little tweaks as I go.</p>
<p>My changes/adjustments as time has gone on have been mostly related to perfecting the crispy exterior:</p>
<p>&#8211; I&#39;m happier with the &#39;dough&#39; chilled longer than 30 minutes (overnight worked out great) &#8211; the colder coconut/meringue mix resulted in a slightly crispier outside to the macaroon.</p>
<p>&#8211; Hand-rolling a ball and then pressing it semi-flat has given me the best mix of a smooth (evenly crisp-able) exterior with just enough texture to be interesting.</p>
<p>&#8211; With the above two tweaks, I&#39;m able to bake it a little longer &#8211; generally about 36-37 minutes &#8211; and get a really spectacular crispness.</p>
<p>The only other part I&#39;ve experimented with is applying the ganache; some people found that the dipped macaroons were a little too chocolaty for their tastes. I found that putting the ganache in a pastry bag (ok, a ziploc bag with a bit of end snipped off) lets me get a nice crisscross of ganache on the finished macaroon. Pretty and not TOO much chocolate.</p>
<p>The extra ganache gave me good practice in resurrecting it the next day 🙂</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a pic of some finished, dipped ones:</p>
