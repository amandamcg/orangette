					<description><![CDATA[Liz, maybe all that time spent planning spectacularly smashing outfits has distracted you from the real prize: the potato waffle.  Hmm.  Something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I think you&#039;re right about Napoleon Dynamite.  That&#039;s certainly contributed to the increased attention tater tots are getting.  But I think the hubbub *really* started over at eGullet.org, on the thread I linked to above.  They can&#039;t stop talking about tater tots.  And they&#039;re serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you find room for the duty-free gin in your suitcase?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amy, I think I may have seen this mysterious potato waffle.  Still, a trip to England may be in order...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Dave, thanks for stopping by!  Glad to meet the man behind weber_cam.  Your gnocchi tip sounds INSANELY good.  I love gnocchi in general, so I can only imagine how tasty they&#039;d be after deep-frying.  Yikes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like frozen potato products as well but sometimes think that you don&#039;t get enough tater for your tot. If you&#039;d like to make 2005 the year of the tater tot you should definitely work in a trip to England, where you can meet the tot&#039;s distant relative, the potato waffle. Who needs homefries and waffles when you can have them both in one conveniently frozen shape?]]></description>
