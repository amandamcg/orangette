					<description><![CDATA[As of tonight we&#039;ve made this tart 5 times. We&#039;ve made it w/ greek feta, french feta and chevre. All were delicious but I think we like the french feta the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for sharing this recipe! It&#039;s absolutely been the best way to use up those beets from our CSA box!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Liz!  I was just asking about you a couple of weeks ago, at Ashley&#039;s birthday party, and she told me that you were in Tucson.  Good to hear from you!  And I&#039;m so glad that this tart was a success.  I love the idea of adding some lemon and herbs - brilliant!  Like you, I&#039;ve been feeling &lt;&gt;very&lt;&gt; tired of beets lately, but now, hearing about your variations, I&#039;m tempted to make this tart again...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Molly. I met you and Brandon briefly once over at Ashley and Chris&#039; house during a wedding invitation consult. I&#039;m in Tucson now and your blog has become one of my go-to staples for recipes when I&#039;ve got some particularly lovely ingredient. I made this tart tonight following what seems like the 20th week in a row that beets showed up in the Tucson CSA we belong to. Beets are one of my favorite foods but I honestly groaned to see them AGAIN. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m a &quot;use up what&#039;s on hand&quot; kind of cook and made this tart with one enormous chioggia and one giganticus traditional beet, Greek feta, fresh goat cheese (also CSA) rolled in a little rosemary and marjoram, splashed the beets with lemon juice after roasting, and added perhaps a tsp. of zest. I also confess to using a frozen deep dish pie crust. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;It&#039;s simply delicious and totally beautiful. The lemon a nice addition, I think. I made two in hopes of using up the beets (no such luck) but am now delighted to give one to a friend tomorrow. Thank you for your phenomenal blog. We&#039;ve fallen in with a very food-motivated crowd down here (shocking); know that the orangette gospel is spreading like wildfire in southern arizona!]]></description>
