					<description><![CDATA[I remember as a little girl being introduced by my Polish grandmother to sliced radishes which had been coated with a generous dollop of sour cream and sprinkled with salt.  While butter, salt and radishes are tasty, the tartness of sour cream tastes even better to me!  Try it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now you may see what point I am at reading your blog. I saw Brandon&#039;s name mentioned in June 2005 and was trying to remember when you first started emailing etc.  And the date you met in the hotel - I have been there a couple times and sorry for being snoopy&lt;/&gt;dear writer but you did tell all in the book!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anyway about the radishes- so a nine year old radish disliker- trusted you and me and we tried them and we loved them.  I was so surprised what difference butter could make - and it truly does not take but a tiny sliver of it yet such a gigantic sliver of difference in flavor- Lexi was so surprised at how much it tames the heat.  (My grand daughter) We still have not made the cake but upon telling her brothers of the plan - we now HAVE to sometime.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t explain it, exactly, but I finally tried your recipe for radishes with butter and sea salt on baguette, and I feel somehow. . . rejuvenated. It just feels so good somehow sitting there, like a little bellyful of sunshine. Thanks for sharing, and happy springtime!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;&gt;Merci bien&lt;&gt; to you, Biggy!  And welcome to Orangette - better late than never, I say!  And three cheers for radishes, too, straight from the train.  Here&#039;s to many more, with plenty of butter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Late have I come to Orangette, but very, very gladly. I appear to be posting to this particular entry about a year later than everyone else, but I wanted to say Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Radishes so do remind me of France (as apparently they do everyone), and when I read this yesterday I walked straight to the market from my train and got a bag of radishes and a stout brickette of Plugra. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;It&#039;s no surprise your blog brings all the foodies to the yard, a la Kelis. Congratulations also on the engagement &amp; good luck with the move! Nothing is quite so good as love + food. Many years of happiness to you both.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A great story, Lisa!  It makes me wonder...maybe the French got into the radish-and-butter thing for money reasons too.  Historically, France has been an agricultural country, and its wealth is a relatively recent thing. Actually, I imagine that there might be quite a few similarities, food-wise, between humble, wallet-conscious cuisines in France and America.  Hmm...anyone need a research topic?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hiya Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;This is Lisa, the same one from a month back, with a short note I meant to relate back then.  My mom and dad and I got to talking about radishes, and your suggestion, and I mentioned the bit about how &quot;apparently it&#039;s a French thing.&quot;  And my dad told me he ate radish and butter sandwiches on white bread as a kid in smalltown 1950s Missouri!  I&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s a curious franco-missourian connection, or if my dad and his family ate these sandwiches because they were cheap and money wasn&#039;t plentiful.  No matter what -- a good story!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for reporting back, Michele, although I&#039;m sorry to hear that you and Martha have had a falling-out.  And to think, it all sounded so promising!  I do have to say, though, that I&#039;m honored to know that I may have outdone Martha, just this one time.]]></description>
