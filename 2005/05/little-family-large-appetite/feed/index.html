					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I finally tried the white bean hummus - so wonderful!  I added a teensy pinch of cayenne instead of cumin, and enough parsley to get some lovely green flecks.  This is a new favourite - thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dawna, I think you&#039;ll be very impressed with the white bean trick.  The creamy texture of white beans makes for a hummus that&#039;s smoother than the regular chickpea type, and the flavor is also a bit lighter, a bit less earthy.  Not that earthiness is bad, you know, but variety is nice.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tara, I hope you&#039;ll keep me posted on your weekend hummus-making adventure...and yes, raise your fist for short girls everywhere!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Lisa, great news!  Sounds like a wonderful, wonderful night, so I&#039;m thrilled that Little Family hummus could be a part of it...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly!  Good morning!  Props to you and all your Little People for having such ardent appetites :)  This yummy yummy dip was a perfect and VERY well-received beginning to a dinner party thrown Monday night, in celebration of parents who were able to forge their ways into the wilds of Manhattan from Philadelphia, USA and Raglan, New Zealand.  It was a marvelous night and while the sweet company no doubt had something to do with it, I think the fact that we were all practically mainlining this stuff may have helped.  Yum.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;peace&lt;/&gt;Lisa]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I&#039;d been craving something like this for the last little while, but was wary of a traditional hummus (too heavy). Your recipe sounds perfect! I can&#039;t wait to try it this weekend. One other thing - short girls unite! I&#039;m a whopping 5&#039;2&quot;. I have to get on my tiptoes to hug my 5&#039;10&quot; sister-in-law.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, that looks delicious, and I will simply have to try it for my next batch of hummus.  I&#039;ve heard of using white beans instead of chickpeas, but I&#039;ve never tried it.  You are very convincing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds delicious, Compmouse!  You&#039;re one step ahead of me...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, margrocks, for making the trip over from C&amp;Z--and for such generous compliments!  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And mav, you&#039;re very welcome.  Speaking of storytelling, I found a great quote the other day through my friend Gigi, a fellow writer: &quot;I don&#039;t care how eloquent your phrasing.  Unless you&#039;re a storyteller, you&#039;re not a writer.&quot;  It&#039;s by Isaac Bashevis Singer, and it really resonated with me and with everything I&#039;m trying to do with Orangette.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Stace, thank you!  Jimmy&#039;s quiche is most certainly filling, and the hummus makes a nice-sized batch...good luck filling up those teenagers!  My mom could sympathize with you (although thankfully not because of me): she has vivid memories of buying entire Cure-81 hams for my (then teenaged) half-brother David in the early 1980s...ooof.]]></description>
