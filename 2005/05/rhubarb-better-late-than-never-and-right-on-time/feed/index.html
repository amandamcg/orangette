					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of baking the rhubard and also adding the orange zest. My mother (may she rest in peace) used to pair the rhubard with strawberries and make either a compote or a pie and this helped cut down on the sugar. The rhubard and strawberries are a natural together.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I too am massively behind with this comment but I have only just stumbled on your blog, such is the way of the blogoshere. Anyhoo just wanted to pass on a rhubarb tip my granny taught me: after you&#039;ve trimmed, washed and sliced the stalks, pour boiling water onto it and leave for a minute or so. Then drain and proceed with whatever you&#039;re going to use the &#039;barb for. The boiling water treatment seems to reduce the tartness and you can get away with using much less sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to bake rhubarb and blueberries together - it&#039;s a good combination.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First of all, I have to say, I love your blog - March 2009 cannot come soon enough. I just finished a light dinner of your mushrooms with fresh mozzarella and yum yum, and I&#039;ve several more of your recipes on my radar for this month.  but I do have to say, because greek is my first true love, and latin just a distant boring cousin, that Linnaeus brought a little greek to our daily lives when he coined taxonomy. You have your loves, and I have mine :) &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;PS. congratulations on the first anniversary! Hope the celebrations (and champagne-induced sleeps) keep you away from blogging for a few more days yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m massively behind the times with this one, so I apologize in advance!&lt;/&gt;I saw the first rhubarb of the season last week, and instantly grabbed two handfuls and raced home to find a good recipe for them.  I found yours and immediately set to work to get those gorgeous stalks in the oven.  Mmmm....pure bliss.  &lt;/&gt;I grew up on straight rhubarb pie and rhubarb crisp (no fancy schmany strawberry mixture for us!) and this was absolutely what I was looking for.  I added a touch of vanilla extract and served it with yogurt (no fresh ricotta at the market) and it was quite lovely.&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rinilini, I don&#039;t have a rhubarb scone recipe to speak of (and I&#039;m out of town right now and thus unable to access my cookbooks!), but we&#039;ll see if anyone else replies with one.  I feel as though I&#039;ve seen a lot of recipes in recent years for little rhubarb cakes or muffins...you might look at the treatment of rhubarb in those recipes and, if it seems feasible, work it into your favorite basic scone recipe.]]></description>
