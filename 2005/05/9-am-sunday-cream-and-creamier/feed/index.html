					<description><![CDATA[Quiche is one of those things that I have always made well, but I&#039;m excited to say that this recipe is replacing my old one!  The quantities are spot on, and I love the addition of nutmeg and cayenne.  Really pro.  The 1 tbsp of flour is brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use this crust with white and wheat flour mixed.  Much faster than Martha&#039;s and quite tasty! http://www.food.com/recipe/quick-n-easy-quiche-crust-18185]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For Miss Tenacity: I have a cheater quiche recipe from college days that calls for a bit of Bisquick blended into the egg mixture to help the quiche hold its shape without crust--perhaps that would work. I know...Bisquick...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I should post this anonymously.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amy, in matters of sugar and fat, Jimmy is a man possessed.  I have no idea what time he rolled out of bed, but it must have been pretty early...although I suppose that he could have prepped most of the individual quiche components the evening before.  At any rate, he *does* deserve breakfast in bed (under, of course, his comforter with an enormous, mournful-looking image of Jesus on it; don&#039;t ask), but the man DOES NOT EAT BREAKFAST.  That&#039;s right.  He cooks and bakes all this stuff, and he doesn&#039;t eat it, at least not until after 11am.  Again, don&#039;t ask.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tara, I will definitely suggest to Jimmy that he consider going on tour.  I think he&#039;s already working on his autograph technique...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Miss Tenacity, now that I&#039;ve read your nutritional analysis, I&#039;m starting to feel a strange tightness in my chest. Wow indeed. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Compmouse, if you&#039;re not too frightened by the nutritional information above, give Jimmy&#039;s method a go!  This is truly superlative quiche, and Sundays were made for the occasional indulgence...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Michele, I think of Jimmy as having something of a saintly aura, myself--a notion that would no doubt send him into fits of wicked laughter.  I think he&#039;d prefer your superhero idea.  Maybe he could have his own comic book?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Melissa, thanks for stopping by.  I stumbled upon your site a week or so ago, and it&#039;s beautiful.  I look forward to spending more time there.  And I agree--9 am on a Sunday is madness!  I have no idea why these breakfasts have been set for such an early hour. I just do as I&#039;m told.  But a couple more hours of sleep might have prevented my cream coma!  [Rebecca, Jimmy, are you reading this?  Think it over.]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, fantastic site, inspired writing, addictive anecdotes, great recipes! I could go on, but you get the picture. I find myself looking at food with more humor now, thanks to you. Anyhow, I do have one suggestion for dealing with all that cream and butter at breakfast (it&#039;s taken me years of painstaking research, naturally), which is - everything is more digestible later in the day, so sleep in! Why are you getting up at 9am on Sunday? Madness! That said, if I had someone making me quiche (or anything else, for that matter), I&#039;d probably get up in the middle of the night. Thanks for the laugh!]]></description>
