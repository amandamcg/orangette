					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;/&gt;Thanks for the congratulations!&lt;/&gt;Yes, the crepe pan was a wedding present and my man would be over the moon if I were to surprise him with these pancakes...I know that we are expecting a rainy weekend so these would make for a very special treat...Ok, I&#039;m sold on the idea now!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;PS. I now go by a new identity: &quot;Tisane For One&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, Amy!  I forgot to post the &quot;don&#039;t read this if you&#039;re eating cereal&quot; warning again!  Sorry, m&#039;dear.  Arm yourself with an emergency supply of buckwheat flour and blueberries, just in case I forget yet again.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And welcome back, Pusekatt!  And congratulations on your marriage!  I think your crepe pan (a wedding present, perhaps?) should work perfectly for a morning treat for you and your man...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;/&gt;I have not commented much lately as the forces at work have sapped my energy BUT here I am. I loved the piece on &#039;Saucy&#039; - The buckwheat pancakes sound divine and I have a brand new crepe pan to play with...wonder if pankcakes will be ok to cook on it...Hmmm. Anyway, keep up the great work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, Molly, you really know how to make me wish for a different meal than the one in front of me. The cheerios I&#039;m about to eat wouldn&#039;t woo even the most forgiving of early birds.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Those pancakes, however, sound perfect. I&#039;ll have to make a detour to my English-Swedish dictionary on my way to the cheerios: &quot;buckwheat&quot; isn&#039;t in my Swedish vocab yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, McAuliflower, and yes, from an inside perspective, I&#039;d say this story is more on the bittersweet side...although the sweet in &quot;bittersweet&quot; may well be quite syrupy.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Michele, thanks so much!  These Cook and Tell pieces have been such fun for me; while the theme stays the same, every month feels like a very different exercise.  I&#039;m glad to hear that you&#039;re enjoying it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ahhh, a very nice syrupy story pooled around your pancake recipe... or maybe not syrupy, but bitter-sweet instead.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I like your colophon- cute idea.]]></description>
