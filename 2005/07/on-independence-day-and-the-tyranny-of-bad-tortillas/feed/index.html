					<description><![CDATA[Just started reading and I&#039;m hooked! I love that these are only 4 ingredients. But...I don&#039;t own a cast-iron pan. As a young&#039;un, with very limited kitchen storage (but thankfully with a Le Creuset that&#039;s pretty enough to display), I am wondering if this will work with a regular old pan. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Apparently I&#039;m a little slow in jumping on the make-your-own-tortillas bandwagon, but I just tried the recipe, and it was fantastic.  I cut it in half because I live solo, and it was the perfect amount - about 8 or so. How does the dough keep long-term?  Do you think it would be okay frozen and thawed out later?  Thanks!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At out last girly weekend, my friend made flour tortillas and I&#039;ve been wanting to make them myself ever since. She was a bit vague on instructions, so I&#039;m very excited by your post. You make it look so easy! I do have a horrible, diet killing suggestion for you. We had some of these left over and the next day we made bacon for breakfast, but instead of pouring out the fat, we cut up the leftover tortillas and fried them. I can&#039;t even describe how delicious they were. I almost forgot to feel guilty :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and thank you Brandon for sharing the salsa recipes, the roasted tomato one sounds awesome!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Audrai, I haven&#039;t tried making any substitutions to this recipe, but oil &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; work.  I read somewhere that if you&#039;re replacing shortening with oil (in any recipe), you use only 2/3 of the amount called for.  So maybe try that: 4 Tbsp. oil, rather than 6 Tbsp. shortening.  Or you could try &lt;a href=&quot;http://homesicktexan.blogspot.com/2007/03/and-end-to-my-quest-flour-tortillas.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt;, which only uses oil to start with.]]></description>
