					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to add my birthday greetings as well, Molly. G&#039;day from Oz and many happy returns!  &lt;/&gt;Look, I hope you don&#039;t mind, but I found your blog using &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.thecoolcook.com&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cooks recipes&lt;&gt; as a search term. I&#039;m trying to find  original articles and recipes for my cooking websites.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I can and do use the article directories, but much of the stuff in them is hardly original and gets widely used. I&#039;m hoping to persuade people like you, who have an interest in cooking, to contribute as well. I use a wide variety of articles and styles - just so long as it&#039;s food orientated - and I think the kind of things you write about in Orangette would be very popular :0)&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The quid pro quo is a link back to your blog - or website if you have one. If this doesn&#039;t interest you, please forgive the intrusion. If it does, I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Best wishes&lt;/&gt;Michael Sheridan]]></description>
