					<description><![CDATA[I made this tart back in may 2020,  when my life was so different from what it is now , looking back I still find myself tearing up . 
Well , I wanted to feel that bittersweet aftertaste one last time  , so this morning I made this tart again .
Molly , some of your recipes are more than just recipes . They are a taste of loss and sometimes survival .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dawna, I haven&#039;t yet tried the rhubarb-raspberry combination, but I imagine that if the raspberries were sufficiently sweet, it could be pretty fantastic.  I wonder if it would generally require more sugar than something with strawberries?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Julie, it&#039;s funny that you should mention the dearth of rhubarb in Manhattan--I tried to find it at Fairway about six weeks ago, and no dice!  So strange--and how kind of Long Island to pull through and save the day!  This tart is definitely a very worthy recipient of your precious bounty, or if you want something even simpler, you could try a &lt; HREF=&quot;http://orangette.blogspot.com/2005/03/praise-for-pig.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;crumble&lt;&gt; or my &lt; HREF=&quot;http://orangette.blogspot.com/2005/05/rhubarb-better-late-than-never-and.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;baked version with fresh ricotta&lt;&gt;.  Any way you go, yum.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Molly -- it&#039;s always a fortuitous moment when I happen to visit your blog.  This time, we&#039;ve just returned from a weekend on the North Fork of Long Island, where I discovered a huge bunch of rhubarb at a farm stand for a truly nominal price.  After a season when I could barely find rhubarb in Manhattan at all, and the few stalks I did snag were super-costly, this was a real bonus.  I&#039;d been wondering what to do with my bounty, and suddenly happened upon your latest post.  Once again, thanks so much!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Zarah Maria, since you&#039;re a rhubarb girl like me, I know you&#039;d love this.  Give it a go!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Clare Eats, I&#039;m jealous of your readily available rhubarb!  I saw some beautiful little stalks at the farmers&#039; market this morning, but they won&#039;t be around for too much longer.  Lucky girl you are.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Sue, that&#039;s so funny about the pink-tinted meringue--it must be the light!  But I&#039;m sure you could make a pink meringue without much trouble, maybe using a rhubarb simple syrup, as you suggested.  Italian meringues are made with a sugar syrup, so you could certainly try it!  You might be able to use the leftover syrup, actually, from &lt; HREF=&quot;http://orangette.blogspot.com/2005/05/rhubarb-better-late-than-never-and.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;&gt;.  Let me know if you do give it a try, and in the meantime, good luck with your snails.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Margrocks, you&#039;re a girl after my own heart...mmm, strawberry rhubarb pie!  Yum indeed.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Johanna, thanks so much for making the (long!) trip over!  The food blog world is full of tangled connections, and I know from experience that it&#039;s always a pleasure to stumble upon something new and delicious.]]></description>
