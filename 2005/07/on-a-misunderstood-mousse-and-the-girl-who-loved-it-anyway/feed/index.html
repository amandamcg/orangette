					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been planning to make this for a few weeks already, and I finally did last night, letting it sit in the fridge overnight to cool down.  Well, I just took it out, ready to give it over to my ice cream machine, and I have to say, it took all my will power to freeze it and not just dish it out as mousse right now!  It&#039;s freezing as I write this, and I keep making excuses to walk by, sticking my nose in to inhale the deep, rich aroma, and then sticking a spoon in...just to make sure it&#039;s going all right :)  Thanks for the recipe!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[you&#039;re probably right.  altho&#039; the idea of a bicoastal ice cream maker is intriguing...an ice cream maker more well-traveled, sadly, than i.  ah well...think i found one on craigslist for $20.  cheaper than the shipping alone...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jessie, it&#039;s lovely to meet you. I too have let a few moans eek out while thinking about this mousse, so you&#039;re not alone.  And tell your housemate that when it comes to this kind of porn, I&#039;m happy to provide.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And violet, thank you!  So sweet.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And margrocks, hmm, well, after I posted that comment, I thought, &quot;Wow, what if she really takes me up on it?  That could get &lt;&gt;expensive&lt;&gt;, all that back-and-forth shipping!&quot;  Hmph.  For now, I think we should both hit eBay and find little cheap-but-good ones to cram into our tiny respective apartments...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I was just moaning out loud.  The guy who shares my office is mildly disturbed.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Molly, I find myself talking about you like we&#039;re friends.  You&#039;ve become quite the trusted recipe source, and I can&#039;t wait to go home &amp; share this one.  My housemate is very appreciative--this is a woman who refers, without exaggeration, to the newest issue of Tastes of Italia as her &quot;porn&quot;.  Hedonism is highly valued in our house.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Clare Eats, that chocolate &lt;&gt;is&lt;&gt; so good!  I hope you get to give it a go.  It&#039;s nobody&#039;s chocolate ice cream, but that&#039;s more than okay--I&#039;d prefer this anyday.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Margrocks, I need to get my paws on an ice cream maker too.  Maybe we should do a cross-country time-share?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Zarah Maria, thank you!  You&#039;re too much, m&#039;dear!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And McAuliflower, yes, &quot;quirky&quot; is a good word for this recipe!  It&#039;s not the quickest, easiest in the land, but it&#039;s well worth it.  The complexity of flavor--not to mention the texture--is enough to inspire a lot of bowl-licking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a quirky fussy little recipe!  Caramleizing  the sugar syrup is an interesting step that you don&#039;t see all to often when one isn&#039;t making caramel.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hmmm, she says as she contemplates her evening cooking plans...]]></description>
