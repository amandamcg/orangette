					<description><![CDATA[Stephanie, thanks so much for stopping by!  I read about your bakery in Sara Dickerman&#039;s piece in the Stranger, and  I&#039;ve been dying to try your sweets--especially that chocolate brioche she described so lusciously! Do you, by chance, ever sell at the U District farmers&#039; market?  I feel as though I&#039;ve seen a big &quot;SUGAR&quot; sign there.  And about SF: you should most definitely pay a visit to Miette--that&#039;s where we bought the macaron pictured above--and Tartine.      Very inspirational, no doubt.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Michele, you&#039;re very welcome!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We are about to visit SF in the next few weeks, and since I&#039;m a pastry chef in seattle, I also have Miette Patisserie on my hit list. It&#039;s in that new Ferry Terminal food thingy. I&#039;m from SF and haven&#039;t been back in 5 years! A lot has changed, but Zuni seems to be still around. I guess we&#039;ll have to add that to our hit list as well! Happy eating!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Clare Eats, I hope you found something to lunch on.  As for me, I&#039;m still recovering from our trip, so it may take weeks before these photos arouse any rumbles in my stomach...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Winnie, you are one lucky woman.  I really regret having not tried one of Tartine&#039;s croissants!  I saw a few of them being eaten, and they looked perfect--flaky layers and a chewy middle, and of course, plenty buttery.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Sam, fear not: you are most definitely the reigning queen of the SF restaurant-review blog scene!  In fact, I may have originally heard about Tartine from your post.  As for their meringues, I &lt;&gt;loved&lt;&gt; them!  I&#039;m a great fan of cacao nibs, so that helps. I think they&#039;re much more interesting in the meringues than a normal chocolate chip or something of that sort.  I found their slight bitterness to be an ideal foil to the sugar-rich meringue.  Mmm.  And yes, those picked carrots were a wonderful surprise.  Wish I could replicate them...so peppery, really unusual.  And lastly, the naan: we ate it at Breads of India, at Dwight and Sacramento in Berkeley.  A great little place with a short menu that changes daily, wonderful curries (meat and non-meat), and, as you&#039;d guess from the name, terrific breads.  The naan was different from any I&#039;d had before; wonderfully puffy, moist, and chewy even after it had cooled to room temperature, and with a slight tang, almost like yogurt or buttermilk.  Maybe we should plan to chat over naan the next time I&#039;m down in the Bay Area?  My treat.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Pille.  As a foodie, you would &lt;&gt;love&lt;&gt; San Francisco and the surrounding areas.  Get yourself there soon, definitely!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Conny, have a wonderful time in SF! Take lots of photos, and, of course, do share them with us...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Michele, I&#039;ll say it simply: I love Zuni.  From the copper bar to the enormous windows, airy space, beautiful wood-burning oven, seasonal food, and refined but casual service, it slays me every time.  Brandon, my aunt Tina, and I started with chilled sherry (Brandon) and Lillet (Tina and yours truly) at the bar (along with some Acme pain au levain and delicious cultured butter), and then we split several dishes: a simple green salad with garlic croutons and Banyuls vinaigrette; a minutina salad (looked like grass) with golden beets, sieved hard-boiled egg, and fried breadcrumbs; housemade lamb sausage with tzatziki and crackerbread; Bellwether Farm&#039;s sheep&#039;s milk ricotta gnocchi with yellow and golden carrots; onion and mustard green soup with a poached egg; a slice of Royal Blenheim apricot tart with ice cream; and a slice of gateau victoire (dense chocolate cake) with whipped cream.  Ahhhh.  Ahhhh.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kate, on est la!  Mais ou sont les gin and tonics?  Hmmm?  [P.S. Je t&#039;adore aussi, ma puce.]&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And thank you, Keiko!  We were alarmingly well fed.  Since our return, our mantra has been &quot;salad, salad, salad.&quot;]]></description>
