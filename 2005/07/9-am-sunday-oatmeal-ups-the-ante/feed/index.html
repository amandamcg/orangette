					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s 8:50AM on a cold winter&#039;s morn here in Nasville. Normally, I&#039;m not a morning person...but this recipe caused my left eye to open halfway...salivary glands drooling from those tempting pictures of your hazelnut iced oatmeal cookies...only one question remains to be answered...When is the next batch due out of the oven &amp; can you fax a copy of directions to your home. My imagination thanks you...now for that second cup of coffee.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lisa, your comments always slay me.  I&#039;m so glad to hear that you&#039;ve been eating oatmeal chocolate-chip cookies and getting your fill of perfectly crafted gin and tonics!  I am &lt;&gt;not&lt;&gt; glad to hear, however, that I accidentally deprived you of &lt;&gt;this&lt;&gt; oatmeal cookie recipe by forgetting to put it in my recipe index.  Ooof! No one should &lt;&gt;ever&lt;&gt; be denied brown-butter frosting.  Many, many thanks for the nudge!  I owe you one, m&#039;dear.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lovely Molly!  I think this recipe is missing from your recipe index.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The tale that led me to this discovery:&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;A friend from northern CA is in town - I&#039;m working in the DC area for a few days, staying in a beautiful old farmhouse on 4 or 5 acres.  I thought, &quot;Perfect, I&#039;ll invite her over for an east coast fall dinner -- soup it is!&quot;  I gathered chestnuts from one of the stooping old giants on the property here and set to work on Clotilde&#039;s carrot-chestnut soup.  And I thought warm cookies for dessert would also be appropriately bundle-up-with-a-scarf autumnal.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;But lo, I&#039;m not in my own kitchen, and the weary blender here was just not up to the task of grinding oats into flour for the recipe I&#039;d chosen.  And I&#039;m fine winging it at the stove but the stern old matronly oven is another thing entirely.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;But my friend was due to arrive for pick up at the metro station in under an hour -- what to do??&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&quot;Surely Molly can save me,&quot; I thought with great calm.  And I remembered this recipe, but couldn&#039;t, in my rush, locate it.  I did find your oatmeal chocolate chip cookies recipe which worked a dream --they were, as you say, toothsome, and quite delicious.  The 8 and 11 year olds next door agreed.  And the (scant) leftovers made a tasty breakfast too!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&quot;But I SWEAR she also had a recipe for frosted oatmeal cookies!&quot; I cried to my mother over the phone.  She&#039;s a trusty patient sort, and she steered me to the spot.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;peace&lt;/&gt;Lisa&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;p.s.  I don&#039;t think I told you: but thanks to you, David Rosengarten&#039;s Frosty Gin &amp; Tonic was a welcome personal-happy-hour-on-the-terrace companion all the sticky summer long!  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a feeling the US book left out this (vital!) clarification, and I suspected it must be because it&#039;s not available there, which is a shame. Tasting it was a revelation for me; it&#039;s not as sweet as normal powdered sugar, but has a definite toffee-like bitterness about it. In Australia we can get the Billington&#039;s brand from the UK, but only in very posh and expensive supermarkets. I make my packet last for a very long time - but quite simply, I&#039;ve never imagined plain powdered sugar and water could taste so spectacular. She also calls for it in her Winter Plum Cake, and that icing transforms the cake. Well worth purchasing a packet if you ever locate it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Niki, the cookies taste pretty amazing too, if I do say so myself.   Since you are familiar with this frosting, I&#039;m sure you can well imagine the flavor combination! As for the issue of the brown powdered sugar,  hmmm, well, as far as I know, such a thing doesn&#039;t exist here in the States--or it is very, very hard to come by, at least.  [I&#039;m sure someone imports it and sells it somewhere, but it&#039;s not at my local stores, even the gourmet and specialties places.]  The U.S. version of Nigella&#039;s recipe calls simply for powdered sugar, straight up.  I imagine, though, that the frosting would be even more delicious with an added hint of caramel flavor from brown powdered sugar, if I could find it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazing looking cookies. I seriously feel a craving for one.&lt;/&gt;Re: the brown butter frosting, doesn&#039;t Nigella&#039;s recipe ask for &#039;unrefined&#039; icing sugar? i.e. the brown powdered sugar? It is in our Australian/UK edition of the book. My version of the brown butter frosting came out definitely caramel coloured.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tara, truth be told, I&#039;m most often a cereal-and-paper girl myself.  Except for the fact that my cereal is granola and yogurt, and my paper is usually online.  Not the most romantic morning picture, I know, but it does spare me the black newsprint smudges on my fingers.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And red, these oatmeal cookies are definitely worthy of being craved.  By all means, link up--and thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I will never cease to be amazed at the treats you manage at 9:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning. If I have a bowl of cereal and the paper at that time, I consider it a luxury! Oh, and if Michele is making her way over in her private jet, I may force her to pick up a stowaway from Canada!]]></description>
