					<description><![CDATA[Awesome recipe, Molly, thank you!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#039;t have thyme so added fresh coriander at the end..also fried some chili with the onion, which gave it a Mexican kinda feel.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amy D., I&#039;m so happy to hear that you and the other Ds found the salad so delightfully divine (oof, nevermind; I won&#039;t add to the d-ness)!  And speaking of Nichols Hills, I&#039;m headed there at the end of the month...should I hand-deliver the recipe to Mr. D&#039;s grandparents?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did make this last night and, as predicted, it was divine! Molly, you were right -- Mr. D loved it too, as did sister D who is in town this week from the Big D (Dallas)! Lots of that letter floating around. We&#039;re sending her home w/ the recipe, telling her it came via the web from a cute red-headed girl from Nichol&#039;s Hills, OK! &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;*A]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, keiko, as always!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Clare Eats, hang in there.  I&#039;m sure summer will come to Australia one of these days, and with &lt;&gt;loads&lt;&gt; of corn...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Misa, what a pleasure to meet another fellow Seattlite--and a pastry-chef-in-the-making to boot!  That corn ice cream sounds outstanding--I wonder if your friend just strained the skins out through a sieve before freezing the custard?  That&#039;s one &lt;&gt;more&lt;&gt; thing to work on when I acquire an ice cream maker!  In the meantime, maybe I&#039;ll see you at the farmers&#039; market, preferably near a pile of corn...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Amy, I&#039;m crazy about you, as always.  Don&#039;t worry; I saw that you&#039;d deleted a comment, so I deleted the record of your deleted comment.  Does that make sense?  That&#039;s why, when you came back, you saw no mention of it.  At any rate, back to the food: you know, this salad might be a nice addition to next summer&#039;s (hint, hint) Leo backyard barbeque.  Alongside a not-dog, I think you&#039;d find it plenty satisfying.  And for the record, I hear you on the cold soups: no, no, no.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tara, I&#039;ll have to ask my friend Kate if she ate any corn this way while she was in India this spring.  It sounds delicious...tangy, caramelized, fiery hot!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Molly, my dear name-sharer, I hope you enjoyed your trip to the farmers&#039; market--and, of course, the salad.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Amy D, so good to see you here!  I keep looking for you on the bus, but alas, no.  I think you&#039;d love this, as would Mr. D.  I seem to recall eating corn on the cob with you two once, actually, in your then-new dining room...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Dawna, thank you!  So glad to hear that I&#039;m not alone in my lateness.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Lisa, &lt;&gt;my&lt;&gt; heart goes all a-flutter reading your sweet comment!  I&#039;m so glad to have played a part in improving your day.  But seriously, next time, you&#039;d better invite me to dinner. Grrrr...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my, Miss Molly.  I was having a very crabby day indeed.  I read this post and my heart was all a-flutter -- at the way you wrote about eating through the year, and at the possibility of brightening my day with fresh corn.  I had to seek out a Thursday farmers market but in this city of abundance that was not so tough.  And it was SO pleasant to prepare ... it took some time, but it was simple step after simple step, and even in my tiny hot kitchen I began to calm down.  We ate it on the terrace with some spinach (lightly steamed, with a little red pepper-infused sesame oil) and hunks of hearty bread.  Yum, yum, yum.  Heavenly.  Thanks.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;peace&lt;/&gt;Lisa]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow - awesome new graphic!  Looks, great, Molly.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Last night I had corn on the cob for the first time this summer, so I guess I&#039;m a little behind schedule, too.  It really does make it feel more like summer, somehow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In India, fire roasted (read: blackened) corn is frequently sprinkled with limes and Kashmiri chili powder before serving. I immediately thought of that when reading your vinaigrette. Absolutely gorgeous! I love the pairing of radishes with the sweet corn in this recipe — I&#039;m sure their crisp sharpness would be a perfect match.]]></description>
