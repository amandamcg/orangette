					<description><![CDATA[Your soup was delicious even though I modified it for a vegan crowd. The vanilla pairs so well with the sweet pear and squash. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I finally tried your butternut squash soup with pear, cider and vanilla tonight. Yum yum! I paired it with the cider glazed salmon from your book for a very special dinner. We actually enjoyed everything so much that I posted it on my little food blog. Nooncafe.com. Thank you for your delicious recipes!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve become a hopeless addict to this soup.  I&#039;ve made it 4 times since November and will probably develop a lovely shade of orange to my skin (my new winter tan).  Anyway, thanks a million for your site.  I am working my way through it (to the detriment of my bum, but hey that&#039;s what Wii fit is for).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, that green cabbage welcome takes some getting use to...I found the chocolate-n-orange header so sooothing.]]></description>
