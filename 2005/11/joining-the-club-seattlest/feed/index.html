					<description><![CDATA[Awww, Melissa, thank you.  You&#039;re killing me.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And thank you, Ruth!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;S&#039;kat, I dare you.  Get out that baking sheet and fire up the oven!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And margrocks, thank you!  As for this orange cauliflower business, I seem to remember hearing of it somewhere, but I haven&#039;t yet seen it.  I&#039;d be curious to know how it differs from the white stuff.  I was surprised to find, actually, that green cauliflower seems to caramelize a touch better than its white sibling.  Maybe it has more natural sugars?  Hmmm.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Nicky, thank you!  I&#039;m blushing over here.]]></description>
