					<description><![CDATA[Shauna, my dear, speaking of braising, you seem to be a master in the making.  For our next cook-fest, how about your braised lamb shank AND some braised leeks?  I&#039;m so pushy, I know.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Cathy, thanks so much for getting back to me with the name of that cookie!  My mother has that Maida Heatter cookbook, actually.  Something tells me I might be able to sneak it off her bookshelf and into my suitcase when I&#039;m in Oklahoma for Thanksgiving next week...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly - I&#039;ve had them in biscotti like you - just delicious!  I was thinking they were in this other cookie, but now I remember that was anise seed.  They&#039;re the Tijuana Fiesta cookies from the Maida Heatter Cookie book.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;PS - I bought a couple of fennel bulbs, so braised fennel is in my (near) future!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly: &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You see, I go away to LA for the weekend, and I miss so much! This braised fennel sounds gorgeous. You and I share an affinity for Zuni Cafe foods. Add another one to the list. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And this autumn and winter is when I&#039;ve finally learned how to braise. I&#039;m going to try this soon. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Now, I wonder how braised leeks would be....&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;So good to see you back, my dear.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awww, foodiechickie, thank you.  I am indeed slowly on my way...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tanvi, you are most certainly welcome. This is a great entree into fennel, if I do say so myself, and I hope you agree.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tana, I should have known you&#039;d be a fellow braising fan.  Speaking of which, your &quot;Braisin&#039; Hussy&quot; gear is pretty damn cute!  Thanks for the heads-up...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Zarah Maria, that&#039;s right: he bit into it like an apple.  It was about two years ago, and though my memories are a bit blurry, I seem to recall that he also was popping some pretty funky-smelling homeopathic pills.  Hmm.  I&#039;ve told Brandon about the fennel bit, and he didn&#039;t seem to think it was too strange--maybe it&#039;s his hippie upbringing?  Whatever.  I&#039;m glad to see that you find it as bizarre as I did!  And as for the parmesan, excellent thinking, my dear.  I&#039;ll remember it for next time.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Your &quot;funky&quot; vodka risotto sounds very intriguing, aficionado, and I&#039;ll bet fennel &lt;&gt;would&lt;&gt; be delicious with it!  And as for your blog, thanks for letting me know. I look forward to giving it a read...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Melissa, well, I suppose Manuel &lt;&gt;does&lt;&gt; have to have some faults.  All we can do is pray, my dear, and keep braising.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Cathy, I&#039;ll be curious to hear what you think.  I can&#039;t imagine that you  wouldn&#039;t be won over, but well, I&#039;m obviously biased.  But as for fennel seeds, do you have a cookie recipe you might recommend?  I&#039;ve had fennel seeds in biscotti and loved it, so I&#039;m open to suggestions...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Derrick, I&#039;m not at all surprised to hear that you&#039;re well-versed in the arts of braising.  And ceviche-style fennel?  I&#039;ll take a bowlful, please.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kayenne, I can&#039;t say that we eat much pigeon over here--many people see them as dirty (&quot;rats with wings&quot;) and would likely be averse to eating them--and I unfortunately haven&#039;t ever seen this intriguing &quot;black chicken.&quot;  I&#039;d love to hear more about it...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Pearl, you&#039;re welcome.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Keiko, thank you!  And yes, I&#039;m slowly improving.  Eating lots of vegetables, drinking water, sleeping wondrously soundly.  Slowly, but surely...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Amy, I had forgotten about that pizza!  You are to be commended for facing down your fear of fennel.  Should you choose to forge ahead and braise some, yes, vegetable broth will be just fine.  As a matter of fact, when I first made this recipe, I was still a pseudo vegetarian, so I used vegetable broth too.  And as for serving suggestions, serve it as you would any other vegetable side dish.  I&#039;ve got my fingers crossed...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A former fennel-hater myself, I&#039;m slowly starting to like the stuff (ordering that fennel pizza this summer was a rather bold move for me, you know...). Now I think I&#039;m ready to give this a go. Could vegetable broth be substituted successfully? Any serving suggestions?]]></description>
