					<description><![CDATA[thanks for that red salad recipe.  i had made it quite a few times a number of years ago and loved it passionately.  i am having friends over for dinner and thought about making it and looked on her site but couldnt locate the recipe, i kept looking under red cabbage...and kept getting a heated one.  then i thought i will just try to remember it and at the last minute i remembered that it was called red salad.  i dont have radishes so i used red peppers sliced and will throw a handful of dried cranberries in at the end.  hooray i was so happy to find it, many thanks, suzy]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just moved to France, and am still in my month of living at the high school where I am teaching English. The BTS students I share my kitchen with are very nice, but not at all tidy. It hardly matters, though, because we have only 2 burners and a microwave at our hands. I cannot cannot cannot wait to move into my apartment so I came make all the recipes from your November 2005 archives! Thank you for loving brussel sprouts and sausage!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Um, can I just say YUM?!??!???!&lt;/&gt;I will be making this A LOT, let me tell you. I will also be making your carrot salad (had that last night) and your asian noodle salad with roasted eggplant (had that the night before) a whole heckuva lot.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Molly, I gotta tell you, you have made me enjoy cooking. I am totally serious here. I absolutely love your blog...it&#039;s my first stop for new recipes. Before I found it, I never enjoyed cooking, as much as I tried. But I have seen the light, lady, and it&#039;s because of you!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Now, I have to go eat my salad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tara, it is &lt;&gt;never&lt;&gt; too late for adopting Nigella-esque hairstyles and Nigella-speak!  I mean, really, if I hadn&#039;t had to do those dishes, I might well have been in front of the mirror, trying to coax my here-there-but-not-everywhere waves into perfect, buoyant, ladylike curls.  Then again, perhaps the dishes were a good thing after all.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Gigi, fellow daughter of a no-sugared-cereals mom, merci mille fois.  As you know, this post was a bit reluctant in its birthing, so your midwifing was greatly appreciated, as always!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Foodiechickie, I agree on all counts.  I don&#039;t yet own any Donna Hay, but well, Christmas is on its way!  And as for Martha, you know, I have nothing but appeciation for her.  She is a little stern and stiff, but bless her, she taught me to make &lt; HREF=&quot;http://orangette.blogspot.com/2005/02/pte-brise-for-pillow.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pate brisee&lt;&gt;! What a woman.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Melissa, I too resisted Nigella.  I only bought &lt;&gt;Feast&lt;&gt; very recently, despite having used a number of her recipes from the &lt;&gt;New York Times&lt;&gt; and elsewhere.  Sometimes she is just too cute and too perfect, and that doesn&#039;t always work to her advantage.  But in the end, I&#039;ve been won over by her recipes, plain and simple.  And she has a lovely, intimate writing style.  And yes, that chocolate banana cake is pretty fine--it&#039;s homey goodness done right. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kickpleat, I remember your post about that salad!  I actually followed the link from it to the recipe, and I too made it and loved it.  This is a subtle twist on that, with a red theme, and the radishes are a great addition.  More than anything, I admire how well-balanced the flavors in the dressing are.  Nigella has a very trustworthy palate, I find.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Johanna, maybe there will be reruns?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Dawna, my sentiments exactly!  Sometimes eating your words winds up tasting pretty good...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Michele, I&#039;ll have to see if I can find some of her old shows on video or something!  I&#039;ve only seen one or two episodes, and neither involved pajamas!  Grrrr.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, very funny story! I always loved to hate Nigella. And I relished the moment at the end of the episodes where she would sneak down to the kitchen in her pj&#039;s and stuff her face with whatever it was she had made during that episode. It was so not befitting of a proper English woman, and it was as naughty as it got on a cooking show. Ok, so maybe I loved her more than I hated her.. its true..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was a bit reluctant to like Nigella at first - I&#039;m not really sure why.  I think it was all the glamourously silver blank pages in &quot;How to Eat.&quot;  I did, however, get completely sucked in eventually.  First, because the food on her tv show looked so delicious, and secondly, because a friend living in London had become a fierce devotee.  Then I started trying her recipes, which, as you say, work beautifully.  Now, I own my own copy of Feast, and have a lot of recipes ear-marked for testing.  Everything I&#039;ve tried has been delicious.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a nice twist to her Vietnamese chicken cabbage salad, of which I&#039;m such a fan. But this is much much prettier! I love all the pink and red and I couldn&#039;t think of a better meal for a northwest winter!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Beautiful post! I&#039;ve always strangely resisted liking Nigella - despite the fact that I surreptitiously read her cookbooks in the store and have even been known to get out of bed early on Saturdays to watch her on TV - but your unashamed devotion has got me doubting my resolve. Maybe I&#039;ll just have to try this recipe and see for myself. p.s. Is the banana chocolate cake really &lt;&gt;that&lt;&gt; good?]]></description>
