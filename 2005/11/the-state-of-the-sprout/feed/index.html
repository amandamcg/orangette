					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely. Lemon makes many things better. But my favorite way to eat roasted brussel sprouts is with a bit of maple syrup, cider vinegar, and mustard. mmmmmm. I want to try the cream-braised brussel sprouts you posted but it may be a while before my hips can stand it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alison, I&#039;m sorry to hear that this recipe wasn&#039;t a success for you!  Say, do you ever squeeze a little lemon juice on your roasted Brussels sprouts?  I&#039;ve been doing that lately, and it really perks them up and balances their flavor.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love brussel sprouts, but I have to admit that these really didn&#039;t do it for me. I made more than a pound, so maybe I didn&#039;t pump up the other stuff enough, but I was underwhelmed by the flavors. I still haven&#039;t found any method I like better than roasting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly!&lt;br /&gt;I just grabbed your book to give my mother for her birthday. I decided to give it a look see to see if she&#039;d like it, and 1 long subway ride later - decided to keep it for myself! &lt;br /&gt;I love that you have this Brussel Sprout recipe in here! In 1997 or so I made homemade cookbook of collected recipe&#039;s - and this was in it. &lt;br /&gt;My friend Kimmarie made them for a NYC orphans Thanksgiving - and being a new cook, she was mortified to see how much they cooked down! They won me over to brussel sprouts though, and I&#039;ve been making them ever since. In fact, I think it may have been the first time I said &quot;you have to give me that recipe!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these years later I&#039;m on edition 4 of the cookbook I compiled back then - and I use it all the time. Can&#039;t wait to add your sin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lovely book. I lost my dad a few years ago - and it was wonderful to hear you talk about yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats on the book&lt;br /&gt;Samie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know this post was written forever ago but, thank goodness for it! I, too, bite my lip with anticipation for autumn brussels sprouts. I like to roast them, halved and generously doused with walnut oil and a healthy grating of parmigiano-reggiano. My heart is racing just thinking about them!]]></description>
