					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post! I&#039;m coming to it almost ten years late, because I wanted a simple &amp; new sausage recipe and figured your blog would be a good place to start looking. I think I&#039;ll try to make this tomorrow, but I&#039;m just wondering why you move the sausages to a glass baking dish. If you brown them in the cast-iron skillet, why not just add the grapes to the pan and then put the whole thing in the oven? Let me know if you get a chance before tomorrow - otherwise I&#039;ll let you know how it goes! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing you&#039;re missing here is a little Bourdieu. Too lazy to dig out the old grad school text, but I&#039;m sure Laada would back me up on that one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, sausage and grapes have cross-class appeal, and sound to me like the perfect dish for the dumping downpour we&#039;re having today. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love your blog, haven&#039;t yet read the book (but congrats!), and am very much looking forward to trying the pizza which, coincidentally, is walking distance from my house!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, you have proved a goldmine - I made the sausages on Friday night and they were delicious... and I felt like some kind of magician! Thank you!  It&#039;s you and Madhur Jaffrey in my pantheon of worship-worthy cooks...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Keiko, thank you.  As of today (November 30), I am officially three days into feeling &quot;normal&quot; again, after about seven(!) weeks(!) of feeling sub-par.  I think I may be turning a corner, so knock on wood for me...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kayenne, stand tall.  Ain&#039;t no shame in loving sausages!  And with mustard?  Even better.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Mamster, alright, alright, I&#039;m kicking myself.  Don&#039;t rub it in!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Ruth, isn&#039;t it just amazing, all those  varieties of sausage at Whole Foods?  Our Seattle store has no less than a dozen different types, each more delicious-sounding than the next.  My eyes glaze over just looking at the display case...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tara, I love your terrible geekiness.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Luisa, the sausages will wait.  Travel safely, get that obligatory turkey out of the way, and then, &lt;&gt;sausages&lt;&gt;, sweet sausages.]]></description>
