					<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh, this is an old post to comment on (but selfishly I&#039;m not writing to share a story of mono, and hopefully by now you&#039;ve recovered ;) )  But I am wondering........where is the roast chicken recipe?!  Am I missing something?  I can only see the comments.  Love your blog and have been cooking from it like crazy.  Thanks for the wonderful posts and great recipes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I thought you might enjoy my Jewish mother&#039;s lengthy, entertaining and wise instructions for roasting a chicken... the emphasis is more prophylactic than aesthetic:  http://davidsfoodblog.blogspot.com/2005/07/how-to-roast-chicken.html&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;If you go to the home page of my food blog, the most recent entry is a recipe that was delicious and I think is pretty original.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks for all the tales and ideas over the years.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Bon manger,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;David Smith]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[I&#039;m going to break tradition and reply to you all in one general comment, dear readers and friends, but please forgive. This girl&#039;s working with limited resources!]  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you thank you thank you for your kind words and well wishes.  I don&#039;t get sick often, so it&#039;s been hard for me to suss out or make sense of this nagging sense of not-rightness, and although I now know that it&#039;s nasty horrible mono, it&#039;s almost a relief to just know what it is!  I figure I&#039;ve had it since October 8, and the worst part is that I *didn&#039;t* get it through kissing, since Brandon, that lucky dog, is fine.  But luckily, I seem to have a mild case, or maybe I&#039;m already through the worst of it.  Either way, my main symptoms right now are just a very mild sore throat, slightly swollen lymph nodes, slight fatigue, and an unusually great propensity for crying.  I&#039;m operating at about 80% of normal, energy-wise, which ain&#039;t too bad.  But I&#039;m going to be taking it easy for a little while, just to avoid prolonging this any further.  I am still working, but with shortened hours, and you&#039;ll be pleased to note that I have been taking my natural remedies, reading trashy magazines, eating well, drinking lots of water, and resting.    Thank you again for your sweet thoughts and words, and now, go on, get back to your own blogs, so I have something to read!  Pretty please.]]></description>
