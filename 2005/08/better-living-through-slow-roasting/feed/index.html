					<description><![CDATA[Made these this morning (all morning :) and I have to say, while they were yummy, they are even better made with halved cherry or grape tomatoes.  They don&#039;t need quite as long in the oven and turn into tomato candy.  Also the roma tomatoes, even after 6 hours in the oven, were still somewhat watery inside, and even a bit mealy. (I guess I&#039;ve never been a great fan of romas).  But don&#039;t get me wrong, they were still fabulous in a grilled chevre and roasted tomato on whole grain bread :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve oven-dried romas for about 8-9hours...large ones leaving the seeds in...by the end, they&#039;re still a little soft and flexible, not like the dried ones found in stores, then I stored them in a sealed glass container in e.v. olive oil, with a garlic clove &amp; basil to help preserve in the fridge.  After 3 weeks, there was mold on top and I had to throw them out.  I want to use them primarily to eat straight or in salads and not in sauce.  Was thinking of popping the whole container including the olive oil into the freezer, instead of freezing just the tomatoes on cookie sheets.  I read your comment that freezing them on the sheets make them mushy and icy and not suitable to eating straight.  Has anyone tried to freeze them in the olive oil?  Alternatively, how can I get them to last longer in the fridge.  2 weeks is insufficient time to use them up when I make a big batch in the summer.  I&#039;m thinking that perhaps I didn&#039;t dry them out enough.  Some websites are suggesting that this sometimes takes 12 hours to get them sufficiently dry.  I do however, prefer the softer texture and don&#039;t want to dry out to a fully leathery state.  Any help or insight please?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been hooked on this recipe for the past month, making at least one batch of slow-roasted tomatoes a week - and by &quot;batch,&quot; I mean 15-20 tomatoes! I&#039;m using Roma tomatoes - it is one of my least favorite varieties for eating fresh, but slow-roasting makes them so much more delicious. I end up eating nearly half of them immediately after they come out of the oven... Whatever is left is quickly consumed within the next few days as a favorite mid-afternoon snack, in salads, and as part of lunch at work, with homemade farmers cheese and mixed greens sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. Yum! I shared the recipe with my mother and she made a batch last weekend - she is addicted too now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just to let you know - I&#039;m making these tonight (a hybrid between this recipe and that posted by Nicky over on DD). We&#039;re having people over tomorrow night and I&#039;m using them in an arugula salad with parmesan (or chÃ¨vre) and balsamic. A perfect salad course, in my humble opinion - thanks!]]></description>
