					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I just finished your book and loved it, but as a proud Madisonian - home of the Wienermobile, it appears that you refer to our company as Oscar Meyer, when we refer to is as Oscar Mayer...why the misspelling? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#039;t imagine it made it into your book and onto your blog as an error. Is it a copyright thing? Please, enlighten me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, I hope you find it soon, Steph!  I was just thinking about that book - and remembering that raspberry cake - when I was in Oklahoma a couple of weeks ago.  I was tempted to bring the recipe home with me and try it again, but then I forgot, and before I knew it, I was on the plane back to Seattle.  Harumph!  Next time, next time...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny, I&#039;ve read your blog before, but I never saw this post... I was googling out of curiosity to see if anyone mentioned the Superlatives cookbook online. My maternal grandmother and aunt and some of my mom&#039;s cousins were in the OKC Junior League in 1984 so several of the recipes were actually family staples (some dating back to my great-grandparents, etc.) There were certainly some interesting food items in that thing. I wish I could find mine... I have my grandmother&#039;s copy of the book somewhere, but I just can&#039;t find it right now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Violet, you know, this all &lt;&gt;does&lt;&gt; sound pretty 1950s, doesn&#039;t it?  Thank  goodness my mom had retired her kidney pie recipe by the time I was born!  Oof.  And as for your taste, I assure you that there are plenty of exquisite  palates in the anti-caviar camp!  Plus, how good can airplane caviar be?  I mean, really.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Julie, we&#039;ll have to swap more childhood food stories on Wednesday, m&#039;dear.  I&#039;m really looking forward to it...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Charming food memoir, Molly. Yours seems like a particularly American childhood, so much like mine.  We too were great devourers of caviar on special occasions (which I think of as being due at least in part to our Russian heritage), champagne, good French food.  And we also had our various fondnesses for grilled American cheese on white, salami, hot dogs, cheese-peanut crackers, lemon cake made with mix and lemon jello...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I loved doing this meme also -- and I&#039;ve really enjoyed learning these bits of other bloggers&#039; food histories.]]></description>
