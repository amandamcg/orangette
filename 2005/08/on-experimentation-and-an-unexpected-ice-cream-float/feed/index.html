					<description><![CDATA[I can so relate to being the cautious baker to my husbandʻs maverick chef. And my mother says the exact same thing about following a recipe exactly the first time! The Maui brewing company makes an excellent toasted coconut porter. I had a float with that and a scoop of tahititan vanilla bean ice cream at the Kona Brew Fest one year--divine!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Even though this post is ages old, I wanted to throw in my two cents. I love doing something very similar with Peche or Framboise Lambic and either a creamy french vanilla ice cream or a mango ice cream I found at Safeway. It&#039;s more summery with all that fruity goodness and the mango works well with both the peach or raspberry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made black-and-tan floats once by making a batch of Guiness ice cream (you reduce two cans of beer to a syrup and add to the custard before freezing) and seving it with Bass amber lager.  Very tasty!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I stumbled upon your excellent post because I wanted to see if anyone out there had thought of a beer float, too. I made myself one tonight on a whim. It was not the most optimal pairing--the decidedly Texan combination of Shiner Bock and Blue Bell Old Fashioned Vanilla--but it was an excellent start. I immediately thought that I needed something heavier, like a porter or a stout, but I think coffee ice cream would have gone just fine with the bock. I love the idea of the lambic/vanilla float. What inspired me to try this was Amy&#039;s an Austin-based ice cream shop with stores here in Houston. They encourage their staff to come up with new flavors, and they always have at least two or three alcoholic flavors. They often feature beer flavors, such as Guinness, Shiner Bock, Saint Arnold, etc. and usually have something with a liquor and/or liqeuer. They are generally very innovative with ice cream--recently they were serving &quot;Cop Stop&quot;, which is coffee ice cream with bits of doughnut in it. So maybe the next step for you is to buy an ice cream maker and start churning up some beer ice cream. Keep experimenting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I once shocked a waitress and several dining companions in a restaurant by actually ordering a small dish of chocolate ice cream, a can of Guinness and an empty pint glass to make dessert.  I think this combination works even better than vanilla, although I love the idea of vanilla with a lambic.  My friend remembers the story:&lt;/&gt;http://grocersdaughter.blogspot.com/2005/08/little-red-apron-guinness-and.html]]></description>
