					<description><![CDATA[Hi, so, I made the brownies last night and brought the pan into work today and everybody loves them.  When making them, it looks like the recipe isn&#039;t going to work.  The butter and the chocolate melt together but the misture is very wattery and when you add the sugar, it doesn&#039;t all melt and so I was convinced the whole thing would be a disaster, but no...they are wonderful and such an easy rwecipe! I can whip these up any time.&lt;br /&gt;Also, i used galaxy chocolate and some dark lindt and all worked out great.]]></description>
