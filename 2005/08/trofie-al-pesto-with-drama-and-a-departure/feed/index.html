					<description><![CDATA[Thank &lt;&gt;you&lt;&gt;, Rose--you certainly know how to pull &lt;&gt;my&lt;&gt; heartstrings.  Brandon is a rare find--a handsome man who spends entire days researching the perfect recipe for x?  yes, please!--and at this point, I&#039;m just saying lots and lots of thank yous.  Thank you for helping me remember to say even more.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And margrocks, great news!  We both have Jimmy to thank.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Jen, it&#039;s a pleasure to meet a fellow Okie, if you&#039;ll forgive me for using the term.  [Oof!]  Thanks for stopping by, and of course, for taking the time to comment! To answer your question--don&#039;t worry, not too nosy--I went to Casady.  It&#039;s a fact I&#039;m pretty neutral on.  Great education, but perhaps not the best social setting for me.  [Then again, I&#039;m not sure that high school is a good social setting for anyone!]  Before going there, I went to Westminster for preschool through 8th grade.  I think of myself much more as a Westminster kid than a Casady teen.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And foodiechickie, I had a feeling...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;ve been reading for a few months, and I must say.. your writing sends me further and further into this warm fuzzy foodie stupor. I think I drooled on myself a little. I can&#039;t wait to try some of these recipes.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m intrigued that you&#039;re originally from Oklahoma City! I&#039;m here, born and raised in OKC, and looking forward to a Bay area move in the next 18 months. I want to ask what high school you went to, but I don&#039;t want to be too nosy.. the internets are public, after all. :)&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Keep up the good stuff, lady.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, &lt;/&gt;I&#039;ve been reading your blog for a while now (though I don&#039;t think i&#039;ve posted before) and boy, do you know how to pull a foodie&#039;s heartstrings. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You always evoke so much emotion into your thoughts on food, it&#039;s really beautiful to see it written out with such elegance.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I hope to find someone with whom I can share my passions with as much as you share yours with Brandon&#039;s.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Violet, SF has my heart too, but sadly, I don&#039;t live there.  I apologize for the confusion--too many places in one post, it seems!  I went to college in the Bay Area and often visit friends and family there, but I live in Seattle--for now, at least.  I&#039;ve got my heart pretty spread around these days...NYC, Seattle, SF, and always a little in Paris.  Here&#039;s a little toast to both of us making as merry as possible with so much bicoastalness.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Jennifer, thank you.  So much.]]></description>
