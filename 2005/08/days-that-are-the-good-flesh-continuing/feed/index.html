					<description><![CDATA[Shauna, m&#039;dear, thanks so much for reporting back!  I&#039;m thrilled to hear that the experiment went well--beautifully, even!--and it&#039;s wonderful to know that I&#039;m not the only one who goes weak at the knees when faced with salt cod tart!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Much later now, but I have to give everyone the update: I made this luscious salt cod tart with a gluten-free crust, and it worked beautifully. I used the Gluten-Free Pantry perfect pie crust mix (unfortunately, on this i&#039;m reduced to using mixes), and other than that, made the recipe as Molly wrote it. It was fabulous! One of my friends said of it last night, &quot;That one made my knees melt.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tara, thanks so much for the Rob Feenie link.  I don&#039;t think I would have ever thought of serving brandade croquettes with tapenade, but now that I consider it, it sounds pretty luscious....&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And farmgirl, thank you for weighing in--feel free to jump on your soap box anytime!  I&#039;m not sure how much this lamb weighed, but I could probably find out from Nicho or from his parents, who raised it on their farm.  The meat from their sheep and lambs has incredible flavor, regardless of the animal&#039;s age.  I&#039;ve eaten their lambs, roasted this way on a spit, and I&#039;ve also eaten chops and other cuts from their older animals.  You&#039;re right--so much of it is in how the animal is raised, how much or how little stress it encounters, and what it eats.  And, of course, how you cook it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a great post--and party! Do you happen to know how much that lamb weighed? I&#039;m just curious, as I, too, raise grass-fed lamb. We&#039;ve never cooked one that way, though. Regarding the whole lamb/mutton/etc. argument/classification, I can&#039;t help putting in my two cents. So many people are terrified of the word &quot;mutton,&quot; and yet the taste of the &quot;lamb&quot; really depends on how it is raised--not just the age and weight. I have had lambs butchered at 16 months of age that were anywhere from 100 to 135 pounds (that&#039;s standard butcher weight, but small for that age), and although people would shudder if you told them that, the meat was incredibly tender, with a wonderful flavor. And yet, technically, this was mutton. When animals are force fed in feedlots, etc., they gain weight much more quickly than nature intended. A grass-fed animal, on the other hand, gains weight slowly and ends up leaner because it is exercising while it eats. Plus, of course, it is much healthier and happier. &lt;&gt;Phew!&lt;&gt; Didn&#039;t mean to get so carried away. Down off my soap box. . . : )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Leslie, I assume your reference to presentation is about the tomatoes, right?  If so, I&#039;m sad to say that I can&#039;t take credit for those...that lovely work of culinary art was done by Kate&#039;s friend Charlotte.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Pille, yes, your description of Estonia does sound an awful lot like Seattle, although it stays fairly mild here year-round, so for better or for worse, we don&#039;t get much snow.  But if you drive even an hour or so away, there&#039;s great skiing.  At any rate, I think I&#039;d be a great fan of Estonian summers!  And as for the lamb roast, yes, it did have a Greek angle, what with the dolmas, baklava, hummus, ouzo, and, of course, the lamb.  By the time all the guests had contributed their own wares, though, it was more of a multiethnic, globe-trotting affair...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Foodiechickie, I hear you! It&#039;s days like these that help me to appreciate--and to really understand, soak up--this amazing part of the country.  Sounds like you&#039;re due for another Seattle vacation, m&#039;dear.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Shauna, I know--I see from your site that you too have been enjoying the Seattle summer and all its glories, edible and otherwise!  As for the salt cod, I bought mine at Whole Foods.  Not cheap--$12.00 for about a pound, in a cute little wooden box--but worth the splurge.  And I&#039;m sure it would be absolutely delicious with a gluten-free crust.  Hop to it!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Brett, well, I hear you about the fog, but when it comes to comparing San Francisco and Seattle, I&#039;d say that 90% of the time, your weather wins!  Even in the summer.  But that said, if you need a foggy-day cheer-up, Mediterranean-style, I think a salt cod tart would do the trick.  Until you can get back to Spain, of course!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tara, thank you.  I was very, very happy with this tart and would definitely recommend it, especially to those who are already lovers of brandade!  Your croquettes sound wonderful...I&#039;ll look into that next time.  Mmmm.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And margrocks, thank you!  I never intended to be an ambassador for Seattle, but sometimes I can&#039;t help myself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The tomato tart looks picture-perfect, and the lamb so very succulent. My only experience with brandade is with Rob Feenie&#039;s brandade croquettes (coated in panko, deep fried), and I&#039;m curious to try your method. The buttery crust must pair beautfiully with the filling. A nostalgic and poignant post, all around!]]></description>
