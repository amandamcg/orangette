					<description><![CDATA[Hello, lady. Wild -- I see I&#039;ve left two other comments here, and wow, what a trip down memory lane it is to consider where I was, what filled my days, who I was eating my dinners with, when I wrote those. Anyhow! Just popping in to say I&#039;m making this right now. I haven&#039;t made it in ages, but it was a standby for years -- not sure why it fell out of the rotation, but I&#039;m so happy to bring it back to the fore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope all is very well. I should email you the thing I&#039;m &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; eating for dinner -- a little treat Arlo and I whipped up today. Not, perhaps, as healthy as kale and chickpeas, but still pretty nutrient dense, and I think it would have been just the thing back in my early nursing weeks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Juliann, this can definitely be made ahead and reheated, but I think the texture and appearance will be nicest if you make it the day of.  Plus, it&#039;s so quick to make!  It won&#039;t take up much of your day.  If it makes the job more appealing, you can trim and wash the greens the day before, so all you have to do is throw them in the pan on the day of.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi!  Just wondering if the greens can be made a day ahead and reheated?  I&#039;ve recently discovered how fabulous winter greens are and am thinking they would make a great Thanksgiving side dish, but try to do the least amount of cooking possible on actual Turkey day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hiya missy -- whoa, it&#039;s been almost three years since I first left a comment on this one!  Who knew then ... that I&#039;d be writing to tell you I&#039;m going to hand out this recipe at market this weekend (and perhaps link to it from our farm blog, if I can get to it!!).  Three years on, it&#039;s still a go-to recipe for all the greens I adore this time of year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Plain Jane, no way!  I love this blog and I love this recipe.  With fresh, organic black kale from the farmers&#039; market and lovely plump chickpeas, it is immediately a staple.  I had it for two lunches and a dinner (with poached egg atop) already, and no boredom yet!  Thank you, Molly!]]></description>
