					<description><![CDATA[Happy new year, Molly! Your leek and tarragon tart looks absolutely delicious - I have a feeling I&#039;ll be making that sometimes in 2006. Sooner rather than later:)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Nicky.  Happy New Year--and happy hunger pangs--to you too!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Ruth, I&#039;m delighted to share my family&#039;s feast. Goodness knows there was &lt;&gt;plenty&lt;&gt; to go around!  Happy 2006 to you.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Ivonne, I&#039;ll see what I can do about that adoption.  In the meantime, enjoy the leeks, and happy eating in the New Year!  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anonymous, thank you for catching my spelling error!  I can never seem to remember that pesky &quot;c&quot;!  Maybe, for spelling&#039;s sake, I should resolve to buy more of the ole Veuve in 2006.  That&#039;ll teach me, no doubt.  Happy New Year!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly,&lt;/&gt;Wow, that sounds like a real Christmas feast! Something the way you describe food, goes straight to my tummy and creates a feeling of hunger each and every time! How do you do it? &#039;Wish you all the best for 2006 and for us a lot of more enjoyable posts from Orangette ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ACB, you know, I&#039;m almost ready for another Christmas meal myself...maybe another slice of turkey with giblet gravy, a dollop of butternut puree, a wedge of chocolate-pecan tart, and certainly another heap of bread pudding!  And while I&#039;m at it, I wouldn&#039;t mind a slice of your salmon too.  And speaking of so much gluttony, I will most certainly find a way to get you my mother&#039;s recipe for mincemeat bread-and-butter pudding!   Absolutely.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Cookie Club, how was the banana cake?  Hope you found it as delicious as I do...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Foodiechickie, your comment is a Christmas present in itself!  If I ever need a favorable reference, my dear, you may be hearing from me.  In the meantime, have a very happy New Year.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Fran, you&#039;re very welcome.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Shauna, &quot;decadent&quot; is definitely the operative word here.  It &lt;&gt;was&lt;&gt; wonderful, although I must admit that it&#039;s also nice to return to the simple things, like the roasted fennel I just ate with lunch.  That&#039;s pretty wonderful too.  Happy New Year to you, my dear.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Rose, I hope your LES celebrations will be fueled by something tasty.  Happy New Year!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Yoony, you&#039;re not the only one!  I got hungry just writing about this stuff.  It&#039;s dangerous!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kickpleat, it &lt;&gt;was&lt;&gt; pretty incredible.  I feel very lucky to be a part of such a food-centric family.]]></description>
