					<description><![CDATA[The quantity is massive...we don&#039;t have an army to feed, just the three of us.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This recipe was not &quot;dreamy&quot; at all and I had to add additional ingredients to spruce it up and bring out the flavour: fresh squeezed lemon juice, fresh chopped parsley, extra virgin olive oil, sea salt.  I think a bit of finely grated parm reggiano would also be nice but didn&#039;t add it. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re welcome, MArgarita!  I apologize for the delay in replying to your question, but you&#039;ll be pleased to know that the answer is &lt;&gt;yes&lt;&gt;.  You can most certainly use canned white beans.  According to the original recipe, you would use 4 15-ounce cans, rinsed and drained. Follow follow the recipe as stated, with only a couple of exceptions: you will need to put less water in the pot when you simmer them, and instead of simmering for 45 minutes, you&#039;ll do only 30.  Hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lynn, thanks so much for coming back with the lentils-and-Scotch details!  It sounds like perfect post-holidays winter fare, and I can&#039;t wait to try it.  Happy New Year to you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here are the proportions for the lentils: 1 T butter, 1 C minced onion, 2 cloves garlic, 1 C French green lentils, a bay leaf, 3 C broth or water, salt and pepper and one-quarter cup Scotch. Carmelize the onions then add garlic, and every thing but Scotch. Season with sea salt and pepper and add Scotch just before serving. We had your leeks (I added fennel too) with tarragon. Just terrific. Happy New Year.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, now that I reflect, none of those items I mentioned have appeared on my blog! Must do something about that. There is a wild mushroom lasagna there, which also works.&lt;/&gt; &lt;/&gt;The butternut squash/ hazelnut lasagna appeared in an old Gourmet, and was wisely reproduced in the new &lt;&gt;Gourmet Cookbook&lt;&gt;; the galette is a variant on a Deborah Madison recipe from her &lt;&gt;Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone.&lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I think Deborah Madison is brilliant-she has a great sensibility, invents truly original dishes that work, and writes a well thought out recipe. Her new little &lt;&gt;Vegetarian Suppers&lt;&gt; is inspired. There&#039;s a brussel sprouts ragout with herb dumplings in there to die for.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The cauliflower is just my own.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good catch, foodiechickie!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;GooberNgrape, your &quot;softball-sized glutinous extrusion&quot; stories are horrifying--and completely hilarious!  But while I do love a little intrigue at the dinner table and elsewhere, I&#039;m ultimately with you: please pass the squash ravioli with greens and beans!  Sounds like &lt;&gt;heaven&lt;&gt;.  Now I only hope the &quot;dreamy&quot; white beans can live up to their predecessors!  Merry merry to you and yours.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tara, the truth&#039;s out!  And by god, I plan to keep him anyway.  And as for this toasted baguette idea, yes, please!  Excellent thinking.   &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Lynn, those lentils sound &lt;&gt;wonderful&lt;&gt;!  I absolutely love caramelized onions, and my boyfriend loves caramelized anything, so they&#039;d be a clear winner at our table!  Plus, the scotch?  Wow.  I can hardly wait to try it.  For precision&#039;s sake, how many cups of dry lentils do you start with?  And as for the lima bean puree, I&#039;ll have a scoop of that too!  I love lima beans, and actually, I seem to remember my mother once making a lima-pecorino puree for slathering on little toasts.  It was delicious, and it&#039;s high time it was resurrected.  Oh, and as for the seaweed, no, I haven&#039;t tried that tactic.  It&#039;s worth a go, though, and I certainly will try it soon.  Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll try the white beans. Have you ever cooked your beans with kombu seaweed? It&#039;s supposed to help you digest them. My son, a senior at Reed, is a vegetarian and I really love making vegetarian holiday food. One of my favorites is lentils simmered with a cup on onions, carmelized in butter, with garlic a bay leaf and veg broth. At the end stir in one-quarter cup single malt scotch. Don&#039;t skimp of the scotch. You can taste the difference]]></description>
