					<description><![CDATA[Irina, I can&#039;t say for sure, but I&#039;m inclined to think that the humidity is at fault.  I know that meringue-based baked goods can be very finicky about that kind of thing.  That said, though, I have never tried baking or cooking with matzo meal, and I&#039;m not sure how it would work here.  (Although, like you, somehow I doubt it&#039;s the problem.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these macaroons today and they turned out DELICIOUS but for some reason the crust is not crisp at all... This is fine by me as they are great anyway but I&#039;m wondering where I went wrong. I did use matzo meal instead of regular flour, but the recipe only calls for two tablespoons of flour, so I doubt this could have made a difference. Is it the humidity in the air, perhaps, with the rainy weather outside and the other cooking I did after the macaroons were ready?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Emmeya, that sounds &lt;&gt;terrifying&lt;&gt;. I&#039;m so glad you could seek refuge in some good, spicy Thai food, the perfect anti-cheese ball weapon!  [Shudder.]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My friend&#039;s brother owns an excellent Thai restauarant where I live and he made wonderful Thai food for us on New Year&#039;s Eve, and the appetizers were appropriately exotic. But this one woman brought a port wine cheese ball, and I don&#039;t think I saw her eat anything else! My eyes were glued to it, it was horrifying, all crusted in almonds slivers that were dyed red from the cheese. Ah. Cheese balls.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[Oh MY.  I have gotten heinously behind in replying to comments!  Mea culpa, dear readers.  Please forgive.]&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nic, until I tasted Tom Douglas&#039;s version, I thought I was solidly of the dense-macaroon camp.  But the wondrous lightness of these, coupled with their delicate chew, is enough to plant me firmly on the fence.  Looks like I&#039;ll be alternating recipes--now dense, now light--from now on.  Could be worse, eh?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Monkey Gland, I understand completely.  You can never go wrong with chocolate, and anyway, who doesn&#039;t love a bad boy?  I mean, really.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Shauna, thank you!  I&#039;m not sure how these would work with unsweetened coconut, but you&#039;ll most likely need to add more sugar.  With a little tweaking and your magic touch, you should come out with something delicious...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tara, these macaroons deliver on rich coconut flavor without all the lead-in-the-stomach results.  Sounds  like they&#039;re tailor-made for you! The sweets table calls...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oh Emmeya, that was &lt;&gt;nothing&lt;&gt;!  My dear, you must see a cheeseball &lt;&gt;in person&lt;&gt;, and then you can truly squeal.  [Shudder.]&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Dave, I&#039;ll have to look up that Cook&#039;s Illustrated recipe.  Christopher Kimball usually hits the nail right on the head.  Thanks for the tip!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m one who loves making rich desserts, but rarely can actually eat very much of them. So this etheral alternative to the favourite dense macaroon may be my undoing this holiday season ... I won&#039;t have my &quot;oh no, I can&#039;t, too rich&quot; excuse to get away from the sweets table!]]></description>
