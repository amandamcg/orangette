					<description><![CDATA[Christina, please accept my apologies for not getting back to you sooner with a reply!  The pesky but lovable beast of Christmas had me waylaid for a while there.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;At any rate, your question is a very good one, and actually, it is one that my mother and I puzzle over each time we pull out this recipe.  The way I have typed it here is exactly the way it was given to us by our friends at the Wooden Goose Inn, and frankly, I&#039;m unsure myself of what it means!  This year, Mom and I chose to measure 1 1/2 cups whole almonds, but as I mentioned in the directions, our crust then needed a bit more water.  Perhaps it would be better to do 1 1/2 cups ground almonds?  Either way, you can&#039;t go wrong; it really is a very forgiving dough. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I hope that helps, and happy holidays to &lt;&gt;you&lt;&gt;!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hi molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;don&#039;t know if you&#039;ll get this question on an old post, but i&#039;m wondering about the ground almonds for the crust: should i measure 1-1/2 c. whole almonds before toasting in the oven, or 1-1/2 c. of the ground mixture?  maybe the difference is subtle but i want to be sure to get the measure right!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;many thanks for a beautiful and inspiring blog.  all the best for a warm holiday season and a very happy new year to you &amp; yours!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad to see you spent your Thanksgiving doing what really mattered! ;) And I&#039;ll echo all your other admirers - gorgeous photo and beautiful writeup. I&#039;m usually more on the raspberry side of the fence than the cranberry, but any tart that has held you captive for ten long years sounds awfully tempting...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awww, yes, Julie, the spice of love is mighty delicious!  And your linzer biscotti look pretty damn fine, too.  I like your idea of making some with raspberry preserves and some with apricot--and with a little nip of liqueur in each!  Sounds wonderful.  As for my mom&#039;s cookies, I had planned to make them this weekend but got sidetracked with macaroons and chocolate-capped fruit-and-nut balls.   Next weekend, I hope...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awww, Molly...there&#039;s nothing like the spice of love to make our holidays absolutely delicious.  I&#039;m so glad that you&#039;re enjoying them!  And I&#039;m so glad to know that you too are a linzer lover.  I&#039;d love to see your mom&#039;s linzer cookie recipe -- and check out my linzer biscotti, posted for Cookie Swap.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It was pretty delightful and delicious, Anonymous, although I must admit that my youth certainly wasn&#039;t all fairy tales, all the time. I &lt;&gt;did&lt;&gt; grow up in Oklahoma, you know.  But yes, I am eternally grateful to my parents, who had--and still have--the generosity and the good taste to make sure that I  had some wonderful experiences.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Shauna, ma cherie, you&#039;re pretty splendid yourself!  And as I mentioned today, I think this tart would lend itself quite handily to a gluten-free variation.  Yum.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anonymous, thanks for the tip.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And kickpleat, we&#039;ve got to get you a food processor immediately, my dear!  I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d do without mine.  If you want to give this a go sans Cuisinart, though, I think you&#039;d be alright, as long as you have some other way of grinding almonds to a fine meal...or maybe buying almond meal?  Keep me posted!]]></description>
