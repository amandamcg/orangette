					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;My father-in-law in a huge fan of pistachios and he&#039;s coming into town this evening. I&#039;m thinking of making these for him, but I&#039;m missing crystallized ginger. So I&#039;m going to try increasing the amount of pistachios and making these sans ginger. But I have a feeling the flavor might not &#039;pop&#039; as much. Fingers crossed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After reading your book I just had to try these scones.  I used your base and did my own twist: 2 mashed bananas, 2 teaspoons cinnamon and 2/3 cup toasted chopped pecans.  I had to add a 1/2 cup more flour because of the stickiness of the bananas but they turned out great!  I can&#039;t wait to continue making variations on your great starter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blogged about them....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://theviewfromthe32ndfloor.blogspot.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, for some reason I couldn&#039;t sleep on Christmas, so I got up at 4am and read for a while and then hopped on your blog and decided to make your scones. They turned out beautifully and Cornelius awoke to warm cranberry walnut scones with orange zest, freshly squeezed oj and coffee. Yum!! Thanks for posting this and I&#039;ll try to refrain from making these every day :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have returned at long last from the faraway lands of our nation&#039;s capitol, full of scones and absolutely &lt;&gt;tickled&lt;&gt; to read all your warm wishes!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;My Christmas &lt;&gt;was&lt;&gt; pretty wonderful, thank you, with plenty of egg nog, two mornings&#039; worth of Lisa&#039;s scones (orange-cranberry, ginger-apricot, lemon, and apple-cinnamon), many tinkly glasses of champagne, a 25-lb turkey, and 15+ family members.  Pretty dreamy!  But more on that later.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;In the meantime, dear readers, I hope that your holidays were and are warm and wonderful, and with a well-stocked table, wherever you may be.]]></description>
