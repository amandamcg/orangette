					<description><![CDATA[Hi, the end of 2013 here, and have to say, I&#039;ve been making these every holiday since you posted them - they&#039;ve become my number one gifting cookie.  Something about dried fruit, nuts and chocolate is pre-commercial, classic Christmas.  And they&#039;re gluten free!  Thank you ~~~]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Made these for a party last night -- they&#039;re wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except ... the dipping. I do not have the patience to dip 47 little balls of fruit and nuts into chocolate, so I just upended the bowl and drizzled like mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked -- the chocolate got on the cookies. They were not beautiful, but they were (and are) delicious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have waited 6 months (since getting the book) to make these.  Forgot 2 ingredients (it&#039;s one of those holiday seasons) and they&#039;re still fantastic.  Can&#039;t wait to try them in their full form.  They will become a cookie staple in the inventory!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am wondering if it&#039;s OK to freeze these fruit and nut balls. This would be my first time making them, and I&#039;d like to mail some to a friend living on the other side of the country. I thought that freezing them before mailing would help them emerge in better shape on the other end. What do you think?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[M - I really should have paid attention to HOW MANY you fit on a cookie sheet! I fit about half as many. Serves me right for having eyes bigger than my stomach. :-0&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;PS - CONGRATS on the nomination!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fatemeh, they&#039;re gorgeous!  But yes, I think they are best kept down to a two-or-so-bite size.  It&#039;s amazing how rich and dense--and, of course, delicious!--a ball of dried fruit and chocolate can be.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Good questions, onehsancare.  The chocolate here seems to work just fine--and have a nice snap, even!--without any tempering, and I&#039;ve never seen it develop a bloom.  I have about 2 or 3 of these left in my fridge right now, actually, and at three or so weeks old, the chocolate still looks and feels lovely.  Hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Molly! Happy New Year to you, as well!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I thought you might like to see how mine turned out: &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/melaniewong/80648682/in/set-1723189/&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fruit &amp; Nut Bombs&lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I think I made mine about twice the size they should have been. Most people only managed to finish half of one at a time. I split the leftovers in half and wrapped them up to enjoy with a glass of scotch in the evening. Yummy!!]]></description>
