I too have a hard time finding enough hours in the day for all the blogs I love to read, so I&#039;m especially grateful that you made your way over to Orangette--and took the time to comment, no less!  And as for hunger-inducing posts, your peanut butter cookies sandwiched with chocolate mousse are mighty drool-worthy.  Yeow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am overwhelmed with hunger reading your posts. There are always so many blogs I just dont ever seem to have time to really enjoy them, so I am super glad I made the journey here today, because it seems like things (food and otherwise) are going really well.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And those mini cakes? Just about the most adorable thing ever!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Pille!  And you know, the foodie thing &lt;&gt;is&lt;&gt; nice, but I say three cheers too for a man who&#039;ll eat whatever you cook!  Brandon has yet to agree to eat Brussels sprouts, one of my favorite winter vegetables, and he&#039;s reticent about raisins and figs.    Grrrr.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Ruth, you&#039;re very welcome.  Reading this post makes me miss New York too...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, that&#039;s such a sweet story and yummy pictures! I&#039;m smitten with someone with rather similar locks&amp;looks, and although he has a healthy appetite (and eats everything I make with gusto), he&#039;s no foodie (he&#039;d happily eat spaghetti with ketchup for weeks). You&#039;re one lucky girl;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amy dear, don&#039;t beat yourself up too much.  You&#039;ve been busy with other NY-area things, anyway, like frozen custard and the best open-faced tempeh sandwiches around.  And honey, I &lt;&gt;know&lt;&gt; you must have gotten your share of love+gelato, or at least the Swedish version, &lt; HREF=&quot;http://amylou.blogspot.com/2005/06/tip-top-krlek_10.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;love+Tip Top&lt;&gt;.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;S&#039;kat, you know, I used to be afraid of New York too, or at least in some respects.  Sometimes I&#039;m baffled by its bustle, by all the dirt and trash and smells and tired faces on the subway.  But with Brandon&#039;s help, I&#039;m seeing it in new, more nuanced way--or some of it, at least...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Michelle, I actually have a couple more NYC food finds to share with you, if I can only find the time to write about them!  Grrrrrr.  And next time, I&#039;ll remember your suggestion: mini cakes and gelato in the same mouthful.  Mmm.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, like Tara said, you are so darn cute! Its great fun to read your posts now that your head is in the clouds :)&lt;/&gt;Im very impressed with the food finds you&#039;ve made in NY. That gelato looks fantasticly chocolatey. I cant help but wonder what the mini cake would taste like with some of that gelato on it :)]]></description>
