					<description><![CDATA[I know I&#039;m almost 5 years late to this post, but I just discovered your blog recently (I&#039;ve been steadily reading your posts, working backwards in time :)).  I have absolutely been engrossed from the moment I started reading it, and I plan on purchasing your book ASAP :)  I tried the recipe for the Chana Masala last night, and it was amazing (although I did substitute a couple ingredients due to my lack of having them in the pantry, and my laziness at not wanting to travel to the grocery store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that this post is about pizza, and especially Brandon&#039;s love of pizza, I was wondering if you or he had ever tried New Haven, CT pizza.  I&#039;m from CT, so maybe I&#039;m biased, but I think that New Haven has some of the best pizza restaurants in the USA.  If you by chance are ever in CT for a visit, or book tour or something, be sure to try out the pizza here!  Some good places to go are - &lt;i&gt;Pepe&#039;s&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sally&#039;s&lt;/i&gt;, and my personal favorite &lt;i&gt;Modern Apizza&lt;/i&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know I am so late in commenting to this post - but I just wanted to let you know how happy I am that you loved this pizza so much.  I grew up only a few blocks away from Di Fara and can say with no reservation that it is the greatest pizza I have ever had in my life.  My dad waited TWO HOURS for a couple of pies last week when I was home for the weekend, just because he knows of my unparalleled love for the stuff.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[DH &amp; I just spent the Christmas holidays with his daughter in NYC.  Based on your post, upon arrival, we made a beeline for Di Fara&#039;s and indulged in a regular cheese pie.  The pie &amp; the venue were all as you said.  FABulous pizza and the devoted regulars who were there that night were right there rooting for us...excited for us to have our first taste.  It was a great experience.  Thank you so much!  ~LadyJayPee]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Question for Brandon. I have lived 1 block from Di Fara for 15 years and am well acquainted with it. I have watched Dom make the pies for all those years and I see you are trying to recreate. You mention the oven temp. which explains why one can&#039;t do it at home. but the mystery that&#039;s plagued me for years, is why can&#039;t another pizza joint get close to the product he makes? It can&#039;t just be the temp because pizza places have these hot ovens. Or even the ingredients because those can be reproduced. The key may be THAT particular oven. Then there is the myth/theory that he is some sort of higher being, which is good for business. But my guess is that the magic happens before the doors open, during the making of the dough (combined with all the other factors -- oven , heat, ingredients, etc). Still, it&#039;s just a guess. After all these years, it&#039;s all I have. Maybe other pizza chefs just don&#039;t care as much...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I have a whole mini-memoir I could write on my relationship to this place, but I&#039;ll spare you. Suffice to say, it was much different when I could walk in any time of day or night and get a slice, or even a hero or an entree (also sublime, but there is no time to make them any more.) But I scored two slices last night, and I am still feeling good. It&#039;s not just food.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, Molly -- thanks for the shout-out.  I had such fun with you on our downtown splurge.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I curse the fact that somehow during my twelve years in Brooklyn I never made it to Di Fara, although I used to go to an amazing Turkish restaurant in Midwood (Sahara by name).  You see, thanks to a Seattleite this Uptown New Yorker will now have to make the trek back out to Brooklyn for a DiFara slice.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Next time you&#039;re in New York, we&#039;ll have to hit Arthur Avenue...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[KibitzingShiksa, I &lt;&gt;love&lt;&gt; your name.  And now, do tell: what part of NY did you live in?  And what was the name of this &quot;TO DIE FOR&quot; place, hmm?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Lynn! You&#039;re so sweet to stop by!  I&#039;m very glad that you approve of Brandon.  And speaking of men who are some-sort-of-gorgeous, that grandson of yours quite a pretty picture too.  I saw some photos of him taken on Tina&#039;s recent trip up to Tahoe, and I can&#039;t believe how he&#039;s grown!  Aaaa-dorable.  And as for Woodstock, yes, it&#039;s been far too long since I&#039;ve been to Vermont, so a road trip may well be in order. ..]]></description>
