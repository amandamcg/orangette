					<description><![CDATA[When I was in Kindergarten, the one place I wanted to visit was New York City. I pined after the tall spires, and cold weather through many years of my life. I dreamed of the fashionable boutiques and the warm, fresh bakeries filled with love, and tasting reminiscent of sunny days with good friends. Finally, when I was a Senior in High School, I got the opportunity to visit New York City with my school. How I wish I had been aware of your blog then, and all your helpful food suggestions. Even though I visited years ago, and for only a scant few days, I know in my heart that I will go back to New York City one day.

					<description><![CDATA[Shauna, it does feel like something of an oasis, doesn&#039;t it?  These days, there are of course &lt;&gt;tons&lt;&gt; of places to find great (and organic) produce in NYC, but the Union Square Greenmarket, smack in the middle of so much *city,* seems to grow straight out of the pavement...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And Amy, your Finger Lakes getaway with Erik sounds dreamy.  I may have to try to wangle a weekend like that myself, although it will likely have to wait until next summer at the earliest.  Sniffle, sniffle.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t get to the greenmarket in Union Square nearly enough when I lived in NYC. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I did however, make it to the finger lakes. A few summers ago Erik and I went camping, swimming, hiking, and wine tasting up there. Highly recommended getaway. Unfortunately, we didn&#039;t get to Chateau Renaissance. Those fruit wines sound (and look) amazing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love that Greenmarket in Union Square. One day, several years ago, I stumbled on it after finishing a yoga class, heading toward the subway. This was its first year, maybe even its first weeks. Nothing made me happier in that moment than finding authentic, organic produce in Manhattan. I went home with bags and a grin.]]></description>
