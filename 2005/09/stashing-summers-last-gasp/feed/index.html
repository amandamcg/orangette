					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://orangette.net/2005/09/stashing-summers-last-gasp/#comment-71614&quot;&gt;Amy&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi, Amy -

Both the ingredients list and the instructions are correct! The total amount of cake flour you&#039;ll need is 2 cups 8 Tbsp (in other words, 2.5 cups). The cake batter uses 2 cups 6 Tbsp of it. And then remaining 2 Tbsp flour gets tossed with the blueberries and raspberries before you fold the berries into the batter. It&#039;s explained at the beginning of the final paragraph of the recipe. Happy baking!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly, 
Super old post but hope you still read the comments..
Your cake was the first on my to-bake list once I finished your book, however I&#039;m frustrated because the ingredient list says 2 cups 8 Tbs flour, but the instructions give you 2 cups 6 Tbs! I came over on the blog to verify but just found the same error. Could you tell me which one it is? All the best, Amy]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m dying to try this but is it crazy that I can&#039;t find a 9 CUP bundt pan anywhere? Even on the web! They all seem to be 10 cup or 9 1/2 inch. I know that I can use a 10 cup, but I don&#039;t want a skimpy cake. What am I missing??]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just delicious!  Used frozen blackberries and fresh raspberries. Omitted kirsch, and replaced with 1 tsp each of lemon and vanilla extract. Took longer to bake...approx 1 &amp;1/2 hours. Turned heat up to 350 for last 10 min because it didnt appear to be browning.  Absolutely light texture, with perfect amount of sweetness!  Love your blog! Just purchased your first book at the great February discounted rate on Amazon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ellen, I am so sorry for this slow reply!  Your comment somehow was caught by my spam filter.  Apologies.  In any case, the baking time in the book is correct, so I&#039;m not sure what went wrong!  I wish I could be more helpful.  The baking time for the recipe here on the blog is longer because you don&#039;t preheat the oven ahead of time, a recipe quirk that I thought better of when I retested and reworked the recipe for the book...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just finished reading your book and couldn&#039;t resist trying this recipe.  The recipe in the book indicates a baking time of 1 hour to 1 1/4 hours.  The toothpick came up clean at the 1 hour, 5 minute mark but the cake fell apart when I tried to get it out of the pan.  When I read the recipe on this site, it showed a baking time of 1 hour, 25 minutes.  Is that the correct time?  Also, I didn&#039;t have kirsch, but I did have an airline sized bottle of Chambord, which I used instead and it tasted fine.  Can&#039;t wait to try your other recipes.  Thanks.]]></description>
