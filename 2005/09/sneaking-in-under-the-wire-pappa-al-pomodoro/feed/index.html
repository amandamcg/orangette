					<description><![CDATA[Ah ah, definitely more of a porridge than a soup. Agree with you Molly.  Glad I stumbled upon your blog as I was writing my recipe, as well as the history behind pappa al pomodoro. I ended up using a similar recipe to yours from an italian website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.196flavors.com/2015/07/26/italy-pappa-al-pomodoro/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made this (finally) with cilantro instead of basil, because that&#039;s what came with my CSA. Also added a glug of white wine just before the tomatoes. Fantastic. Thank you so much for this recipe--it&#039;s really killer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, you didn&#039;t say to double - no, triple? - this recipe.  OH. Ohhhhhh...!  Comfort in a cup. Comfort in 3 cups in a row... and now...*gone*. thank you and thank goodness for this recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awww, Clare, you&#039;re too kind.  You know, I &lt;&gt;was&lt;&gt; wearing fishnets through this entire wind-battling exercise, so I suppose that counts for something.  Still, it wasn&#039;t one of my finer moments.  But pappa al pomodoro certainly was!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Gina Louise, I am horrendously jealous of you, what with all that French yogurt you&#039;ve got on hand--not to mention the fact that &lt;&gt;you live in Lyon&lt;&gt;!  Sigh.  But say, have you tried Mamie Nova yogurt?  It comes in a little paper cup rather than a cute glass container, but it makes up in flavor (rhubarb! pistachio!) what it lacks in presentation.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;S&#039;kat, this may well be just the dish for you, and at just the right moment.  And as for public transportation, yes, I certainly appreciate it, but there are days when I just want my car, silence, and garage-to-garage transport...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Teri, thank you!  Lovely to meet you.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Foodiechickie, your comment made my morning! Magazines, cookbooks, and the like?  That&#039;s the dream, m&#039;dear.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Amy, I&#039;m so sorry to torture you once again!  In the future, maybe you should only visit when you&#039;re having fika?  Preempt the suffering, you know?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Dawna, that&#039;s exactly it!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Carol, I just hopped over to Celadon Cupcake, and I see that you&#039;ve been dining at Zuni recently!  I&#039;m very, very jealous.  I make their roasted chicken all the time--the &lt;&gt;best&lt;&gt; method--but I have yet to do the accompanying bread salad.  It sounds astoundingly good.  It may be next on the docket...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nwsjournalism, if you do try it with gluten-free bread, please let me know what you think.  I&#039;d be curious to hear how it turns out, since g-f breads have such a different texture and flavor from wheat-based breads.  Good luck!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Jason, let&#039;s see what I can cram in a nutshell.  I come from a very food-centric family: my mother is a great home cook and baker; my father was a wonderful, fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants cook; one of my half-brothers went to the Culinary Institute of America and now owns four restaurants; my other half-brother is a great home cook; and my half-sister is a terrific home cook and baker as well.  I grew up sitting down to dinner every night with my parents (my half-siblings are older, and were thus already out of the house), and holidays were and are days for huddling around the kitchen.  So I grew up knowing that food was important, although it didn&#039;t really hit home until I was 17 or so, when I had a personal food epiphany of sorts over breakfast at a b&amp;b in Maine.  That breakfast lit the fire, so to speak.  [Speaking of which, I wrote an essay shortly after that fateful morning; I may have to pull it out of the ole dustbin!]  At any rate, in the past ten years, I&#039;ve worked for a caterer, interned at Greens Restaurant in San Francisco, and worked at Whole Foods, and I&#039;ve eaten, read, and cooked a lot.  And of course, I still do.  So there you have it: a life, as told through food...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Michele, I agree completely.  Miam, miam indeed!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Rachael, the Zuni cookbook is wonderful, isn&#039;t it?  Some of the recipes are a tad labor-intensive, to say the least, but it&#039;s all such rustic, lusty, beautifully balanced food.  And I love the intimate feeling of Judy Rodgers&#039; detailed, step-by-step instructions.  Now, get to work with those tomatoes...]]></description>
