					<description><![CDATA[I know I am quite late in commenting ad this post is from 2005 but.... I have grown up making ricotta balls with my mom... and just as a suggestion... next time try assing some raisins to the batter (small ones though b/c they plump up) and for alcohol we usually use a splash of dark rum and a more generous splash of grand marnier... SO delicious, and the raisin adds that little extra bit of sweetness and chew!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;love this blog!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[They weren&#039;t quite &quot;fritters&quot;, at least not as I normally think of them, but my ex-MIL used to fry up ricotta (which sounded like riGOtta when she said it) for a treat. I don&#039;t remember her adding anything to them but I&#039;ll have to ask. I thought she just flattened a bit of cheese in her palm and then fried it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Michele, really, it doesn&#039;t get much better than deep-fried ricotta.  And if I may be so bold, I think the Knights&#039; love for me grew exponentially that night.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tanvi, thanks for thinking of me.  I&#039;ll get right on that meme!  And you&#039;d better do the same with your fritters...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Ruth, since you and Tanvi have both tagged me, I can&#039;t help but comply!  Off to the archives I go.  Thanks for thinking of me...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And thank you, LisaJoy!  This is one addiction I&#039;m happy to enable.]]></description>
