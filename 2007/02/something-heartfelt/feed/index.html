					<description><![CDATA[Carrie, it&#039;s never too late to comment. In fact, I just recently found Orangette (featured in ELLE) and tracked down this chocolate tart for my hubby&#039;s birthday. It&#039;s in the oven now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run wine tours in Italy (La Dolce Vita Wine Tours), and here are a few perfect chocolate pairings. While Pinot Noir is often teamed up with milk chocolate, this calls for something else. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Option #1: Marsala. Don&#039;t wrinkle your nose. Just buy a good bottle of Marsala Superiore (such as Pellegrino or, if you really want the best of the best, Marco De Bartoli&#039;s Masala Superiore.) To Die For.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Option #2: Port wine. Again, avoid the bargain-basement version. Try instead of LBV, or Late Bottle Vintage, which is a poor man&#039;s vintage. Smith Woodhouse&#039;s unfiltered version is opulent and deep. Or go for an aged Tawny, like Grahams 10 or 20 Year. They cost a bit, but the tawnies last opened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Option #3: Brachetto d&#039;Acqui. This is a light frizzante dessert wine from Piedmont. It&#039;s like Moscato d&#039;Asti, but it&#039;s red. Sooooo yummy. It&#039;s like drinking red raspberries, so it&#039;s a great match with chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try all three at your next wine club!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I realize the last post made was in 2007, and it&#039;s, um, 2011, but I have more recently been directed to your blog by a good friend - the same good friend who has issued an Orangette food challenge whereby we select a recipe, make it, and review how the process went. As I am hosting February&#039;s wine club (yep - not book or knitting - wine), and as it&#039;s February, I wanted to make something lovely for the girls. This seemed to fit the bill on screen and if the initial waftings that are coming from my oven are any indication, it shall be just the ticket in real life. I was going to serve it with a nice Cabernet, but I&#039;m thinking with the bittersweet, maybe something lighter, like a Pinot Noir. If you have recommendations (that is, if you check blog posts made 4 years past inception), I&#039;m all ears! If not (wine club is tomorrow - I made the tart today on purspose, though, because I hear it&#039;s tremendous day 2) - thanks for the lovely dessert idea and recipe! I shall review it well!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yep, Michelle, you found me!  So glad you did.  And as for the Mediterranean Deli, I know - isn&#039;t the falafel terrific?  Some of the best I&#039;ve had in the States, for sure.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nico, I think you&#039;ll really like Portland.  Summer should be gorgeous there, too.  E-mail me - cheeseandchocolate (at) gmail (dot) com - and I&#039;ll pass along some recommendations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds like Portland is the place to be. It turns out that I&#039;ll be living there due to an internship throughout the summer. Any tips food or non-food related are highly appreciated!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello,&lt;/&gt;I think this is the blog of the gal that I saw on the TV commericial. Let me know. I thought this was such a cool story that I immediately got up from the TV and came to my computer to try and find this blog ... and here I am. I was just happy to see that two people were as into food as much as I am. Love the blog and the reicpes and plan on visiting again. I was surprised to see that Oklahoma City was your home town as that&#039;s where I&#039;m from, and I love the falafals at Mediterranean Deli!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lovely to meet you, Michelle.  I&#039;m so sorry, though, to hear of the demise of your food processor - and in the middle of making Little Family hummus, no less!  I feel responsible!  That&#039;s really awful.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;But you&#039;re smart, though, to be thinking already about replacing it.  I &lt;&gt;love&lt;&gt; my food processor, and it&#039;ll be a sad, sad day when it dies on me.  Mine is a Cuisinart with an 11-cup bowl (the Prep 11 Plus), and it works beautifully.  I find that it&#039;s just the right size - not too big for making a batch of pesto, say, but big enough for pureeing winter squash and making big batches of hummus.  My only quibble with it is that its feed tube is pretty narrow.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;More recently, we got a smaller version as well - the Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus - and it&#039;s nice too, although too little to use for much.  I like it for pureeing bananas, and Brandon has used it for some salsa-type things too.  But in general, I&#039;d recommend an 11-cup.  Hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly!  I&#039;ve been coming to your site for some time, but have never made a post.  I&#039;ve used a few of your recipes, all of which were fantastic.  Thank you for creating such a great site.  I also love to tweak and adjust recipes, and it&#039;s interesting to read what someone else has to say about such things.  I do have one question: you use a food processor frequently.  What kind do you have?  I *used* to have a little one, up until earlier tonight when mine broke while making your Little Family hummus.  (Now I have to figure out what to do with half-chunky, half-creamy hummus, hehe.)  I need to get another one, but I thought I&#039;d ask what kind you prefer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I so agree with you.  My husband I have so many more meaningful memories during the year, that Valentines day seems sort of superficial in a way, so we usually don&#039;t do anything too big.  Thanks for sharing the Chocolate Tart recipe.  It sounds delicious and I know I am going to be using it soon!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That sounds like a great trip Molly!  I have been hearing great things about the food in Portland - and Chocolate and Almodovar really &lt;&gt;does&lt;&gt; sound like heaven. Gotta hit the hay now... I am getting up early to make your doughnut muffins for brunch tomorrow morning!]]></description>
