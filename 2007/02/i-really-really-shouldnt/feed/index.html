					<description><![CDATA[Something about these old posts makes me so nostalgic that I keep coming back for more . AT the time this recipe was posted I wasn&#039;t into cooking yet as I was 13 ! It took me 3 more years to bake my first cake ... 
I was searching for something to bake next weekend because I will be spending a couple of days at my sister&#039;s , something 3-year-old-friendly as my niece is not so much into cake , sigh !
A futur cake recipe makes me excited . That&#039;s the magic of it and mainly why I never stopped baking ever since that first cake 11 years ago !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks to the Spilled Milk banana bread episode, I am now on a mission to make all of your banana breads. Unfortunately, however, I made this one and then immediately had all of my friends and family ask me to make it  for them. This recipe adapts well to a mini loaf pan (reduce baking time to about 40 minutes)!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this recipe exactly as it was written and I can say, without a doubt, it is one of the most delicious banana breads I&#039;ve ever had. And I was really shocked that it held together without egg-- the texture is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love your very personal, very beautiful site. Thank you for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These were intensely coconut-y when baked with half butter, half coconut oil.  I also swapped in the multigrain flour mix from Good to the Grain for half the flour - and baked them as muffins.  So fragrant and tropical for the beginning of summer!]]></description>
