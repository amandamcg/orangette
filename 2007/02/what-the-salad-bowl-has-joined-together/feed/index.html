					<description><![CDATA[My escarole was bitter, but still very good!  I just bought it for the first time (by accident).  When I tasted it plain, it was definitely bitter, about on par with lettuce stems in summer.  I then added a dressing of equal parts pomegranate molasses, balsamic vinegar &amp; olive oil.  I had no problem eating it all, the assertive dressing stood up to the bitter.  But don&#039;t feed this to your friends who are used to iceberg lettuce...  My escarole was purchased from whole foods at the end of March, and grown in mexico.  Maybe it changes with the season.]]></description>
