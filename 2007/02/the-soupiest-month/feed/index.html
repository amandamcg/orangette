					<description><![CDATA[Molly! I love your blog and have been reading through the archives because I only discovered it a few years ago. I am so happy to see this recipe! I was an exchange student to Ecuador when I was in high school (many, many years ago...ahem...), and Locro was one of my favorite foods there. I have not eaten it for 23 years! I will very happily try out this recipe soon. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In rifling around the internet looking for an interesting soup to make with my turkey leftovers, I came across this post. I remember seeing the recipe when it came out in Gourmet, but my family is from Ecuador and I grew up eating and making locro at least every other week in the winter. Some notes from our house...You can heat the oil and achiote in the microwave for a couple of minutes on med-low (I use a Pyrex measuring cup so I can judge the color and pour it straight through the strainer into the pot). And I have successfully used skim milk and whatever random bits of cheese are in the fridge. I just cook the soup down until the potatoes fall apart, but with some chunks left. Mashing a little with the wooden spoon is as far as I go. Also, it&#039;s traditionally served with rice cakes--just leftover cold rice mixed with beaten egg, salt &amp; pepper, and pan fried (like fritters). One more really nice addition is some quick pickled red onions. Slice a red onion thinly, and stir in the juice of a lemon and a bit of water. Cover and microwave for about a minute. Chill until ready to serve. We ladle up the soup, and everyone helps themselves to the condiments: avocados, rice cakes and onions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#039;s also nice to use chicken broth (preferably from a chicken roasted with plenty of cumin), leave the soup a little brothy and chunky, and add some toasted tiny bowtie pasta near the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone eats this soup--from my narrow-minded grandfather who believed potatoes came from Ireland, not South America, to picky children who usually subsist on chicken nuggets and the occasional grape. Glad you tried it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My apologies for taking so long to reply to your question, Sally!  But I&#039;ve been thinking about it, and you know, I just don&#039;t know that there&#039;s a good way to make this soup dairy-free.  Its flavor and texture are so dependent on both the milk and the cheese - I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s not worth the trouble to try to get around them.  If you do find a way, though, please let me know!  I&#039;d love to hear...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve made this soup and loved it . . . but now I&#039;ve been diagnosed with a dairy allergy (along with wheat, soy, and others).  Any suggestions for a substitution for the whole milk?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Latin American variations are particularly interesting to me.  That&#039;s where potatoes started, and for some reason they just have the best variations on the theme.  ;&gt;  Not bland.  Smooth and rich and flavourful instead of stodgy and boring.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I usually substitute cilantro for the guascas, because it is a major pain to get in the states.&lt;/&gt;http://www.b-and-t-world-seeds.com/86392.html&lt;/&gt;The above link describes guascas, and has a recipe similar to mine.  (It&#039;s like chicken soup, no two are exactly the same.)  I get my guascas when Dad goes back to Latin America for a trip.  ;&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hmmm...  And I didn&#039;t mention before, but traditional ajiaco has as many kinds of potatos as you can get.  In the Andes, 8-10 varieties are easy to come by.  I must warn you, though, that purple potatoes will turn your ajiaco an odd grey color.  It still tastes dandy, but the color is ... interesting.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, Christina, that sounds SO good.   Thank you for sharing your formula!  I love the thought of the chicken and corn in there.  One question, though: what is guascas?  Is it an herb?  Help!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Try ajiaco if you like potato soups. It&#039;s the national dish of Colombia. It&#039;s like chicken soup, in that it comes in many forms.  My recipe, you cook a chicken (with a bay leaf, a lttle salt &amp; pepper, and a little onion,) and set it aside to cool.  Skim the broth, and cook poataoes in it, along with guascas if you can get it, and cilantro if you can&#039;t.  Take about half the potatoes and blend them.  Add broth until you like the texture.  Add the chicken meat, corn, onions, salt, pepper, maybe a little more cilantro or guascas, and the bay leaf from earlier, and then cook until the onion is tender.  Throw the rest of the potatoes back in.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Serve with heavy cream, sliced avocado, and capers.  Pour in the cream until the stew is more soup-like. The potato stew, avocado, and cream all have a rich, smooth flavor, and the capers adds a sharp counterpoint.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Yummy!]]></description>
