					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;Somehow I am always commenting years behind your posting..but I&#039;d like to let you know--vive los soba noodles! Just made them last night in San Francisco and they came out beautifully. We may have gotten a little out of hand with the siracha, but delish nonetheless. My food photography can&#039;t compete with yours, but I thought you/Brandon might get a kick out of this: http://www.flickr.com/photos/50562616@N04/?saved=1]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so tired of the boxed annie chun&#039;s peanut sesame noodles i&#039;ve been making to take to work...you&#039;ve shown me the light! i had to use lemon juice instead of lime, and i cooked a few too many noodles, but it came out delicious. and i&#039;m certainly happy to have tons of leftovers for the rest of the week.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my goodness...thank you thank you for linking to this in your recent post.  I just made it for lunch with the veggies I had on hand: mushrooms, thinly sliced spring onion (green and white parts) and raw asparagus - I had the ends saved to make soup or some such thing but I decided to try out Harold McGee&#039;s &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/dining/06curi.html?scp=1&amp;sq=harold%20mcgee%20asparagus&amp;st=cse&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; theory&lt;&gt; and slice them into little crunchy disks.  It worked perfectly, and the dressing is fabulous!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anonymous, you&#039;re fine to eat it on Friday.  This should keep in the fridge for a few days, easy.  The chicken might shorten its lifespan a little - I don&#039;t like to eat chicken more than three days after it has been cooked; maybe I&#039;m weird? - but it&#039;ll be just fine for Friday.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made this last night, and it was lovely - just the perfect easy, fresh-veggie-ful meal you want to make after the holidays. We added some leftover chicken and quite a bit more hot sauce and it worked well. One final question: how long will this keep in the fridge? Tomorrow is New Year&#039;s but I&#039;d really like to take the leftovers to work on Friday...Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this for dinner tonight. It&#039;s the first time I&#039;ve cooked something from the site and it was wonderful! I used lemon juice instead of lime and added some thinly sliced cabbage and stir-fried chicken. I think I overcooked the soba as it was a little hard to mix but I can&#039;t wait for leftovers tomorrow!]]></description>
