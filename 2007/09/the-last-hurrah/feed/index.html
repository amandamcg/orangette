					<description><![CDATA[I took the tapenade and some gorgeous ripe tomatoes and a baguette to a dinner gathering last night and we all loved it.  I used the bright green olives castlea....something and lots of basil from my garden.  It was amazing - I drizzled the vinegrette all over and passed the tampanade and bread. The plate did not need to be washed!!! Thanks for the idea, we are all kinda burned on the capreese at this point.  I&#039;ll definitely make this dish again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a coincidence, Toni!  I&#039;ll have to look up that recipe...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Julie, I still hold out hope for that man of yours!  Brandon was an olive hater too until just a few months ago.  He&#039;s still picky - he likes picholines best, and Nicoise, but absolutely nothing oil-cured and wrinkly - but he&#039;s finally eating &#039;em.  &lt;&gt;Phew&lt;&gt;!  I&#039;ve got my fingers crossed for G...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I like the idea of that, jules - passing the tomato relay baton!  Take it and go forth, lady.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;(Lauren, thank you for e-mailing me about the meatballs!  I&#039;m ridiculously late in replying to these comments, as you can see, so I&#039;m glad you took the bull by the horns and dropped me an e-mail too.  Hope those pine nuts are behaving now...)&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, Maryann!  Hello to you too.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you, 11frogs!  And I love the idea of your pesto party.  I&#039;ll have to steal that one of these days...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tomatoes in fish sauce, Lynn?  I can&#039;t quite imagine what it would taste like, but I&#039;m game to give it a go!  Thanks for the suggestion.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oooh, Misti, I&#039;m jealous.  Tomatoes from October to May?  Too good to be true.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I love that, logos mori!  Scarpetta, is it?  I&#039;ll have to remember that.  (And roasted boar with leeks?  Wow, wow, wow!)&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Emilie, have you tried slow-roasting those tomatoes of yours?  It&#039;s a really good way to make use of lots of them at a time.  &lt; HREF=&quot;http://orangette.blogspot.com/2005/08/better-living-through-slow-roasting.html&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&#039;s&lt;&gt; how I do it.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Well, thank &lt;&gt;you&lt;&gt;, Thea!

					<description><![CDATA[Delurking to say that my most favorite word that I learned while in Italy on my honeymoon was the word for mopping up &quot;slurry&quot; with bread -- &lt;&gt;scarpetta&lt;&gt;.  A wonderful waiter named Firenzo even showed us how to add to the slurry with extra olive oil and salt and pepper and enjoy every last bite.  We didn&#039;t have any room, but we weren&#039;t going to let the  juices of roasted boar and leeks go to waste!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here in Florida tomato season is about to start up again. Our season is from around October to May and then it wanes in the heat and rains of the summer. I&#039;ve been missing them all summer and am ready to get them back! Probably one of my favorite things to grow! &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And caprese salad...mmmmm!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely agreed with the hurrah! We had a pesto party last week - each and every dish on the buffet contained pesto, just to get us appropriately sick of it before winter. It didn&#039;t work, of course, and I have a year&#039;s worth in the freezer. Great recipe, and what a beautiful wedding you had - congratulations!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a wonderful site you have here! I wanted to stop by and give a hello :)&lt;/&gt;It&#039;s always the same every year with the tomatoes. They appear and you are in love. Then, the flood and you kinda get sick of them. Then they are gone and you miss them so much haha]]></description>
