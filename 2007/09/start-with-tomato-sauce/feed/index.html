					<description><![CDATA[A little late to the party, but I can&#039;t say enough about this sauce, thanks to this blog. Initially, I used the DOP Italian imported tomatoes Whole Foods offers, then tried Costco&#039;s brand of diced tomatoes, and finally, tried Muir Glen&#039;s. I have to say the 4+ dollars I spent on the 28 oz. can of DOP Italian tomatoes was well worth it. The others yielded really good sauce, but the Italian tomatoes were sublime. Somehow, they&#039;re smoother. No matter what--the sauce is killer good.]]></description>
