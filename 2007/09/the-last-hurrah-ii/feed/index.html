					<description><![CDATA[This recipe popped in my head last night out of no where and the three super sweet ears of corns I had just bought got cooked in a pot of brown butter-- and hoo-ly why didn&#039;t I try this before?

					<description><![CDATA[dinner tonight: a handful of fresh arugula, this corn (you may have had your last hurrah 3 months ago, but sunday at the farmer&#039;s market, the white corn was so sweet and poppy that they had a bowl of fresh, raw kernels out as samples) spooned over the arugula while still hot to just wilt it a bit, and homemade breadcrumbs, toasted in the leftover butter with sage.  soooo good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I have been an avid reader of your blog for the last year and just love reading your posts! I absolutely love corn and wanted to suggest that you visit a restaurant called &quot;Al di la&quot; the next time you visit NYC (http://www.aldilatrattoria.com) . It is in Park Slope, Brooklyn and while everything they serve is simply masterful (think the trattoria in &quot;Big Night&quot;), their Tortelli with Corn filled with fresh sweet corn, mascarpone, and truffle butter is truly one of the most heavenly things I have ever eaten. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks for the recipe-- i will try using it before the good corn goes away....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh.My.God.  This was so good!  You posted right after I bought corn and picked lemon thyme from my garden, so this recipe was tailor-made for us.  Thank you for such a simple and spectacular dish!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jamie, that Bundt pan trick is genius!  Thank you.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;It was most definitely memorable, Kate!  Worth getting off the couch for.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;So, mb, how did they like it?  I hope it was a big hit...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;That&#039;s an excellent rule to live by, Kevin.  Very, very smart.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hillary, that&#039;s sweet of you to think of me, even though - I have to admit - I&#039;m a little skittish about memes.  But as for those five foods I&#039;m ashamed to love, hmm.  Let&#039;s see.  I guess I &lt;&gt;do&lt;&gt; feel a little lame about my love for Frosted Mini Wheats, and I really love hot dogs, no matter how nasty people tell me they are.  You can also count me in on those Nabisco Pinwheels cookies, the ones with marshmallow and chocolate.  (Oh, sweet sweet Pinwheels!)  And though I haven&#039;t had them for a dozen years or so, I&#039;ll bet I&#039;d still love Cheetos...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oh no, Maryam!  That&#039;s terrible.  You should start some sort of campaign.  Edible corn for Marrakesh!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oh, I&#039;m so glad, Marika.  So glad to know you liked it.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks for the ginger tea suggestion, Caroline!  Our friend Sam recommended something similar, but at the time, in the thick of my stomach ache, it just didn&#039;t sound good.  It&#039;s a smart thing to have my arsenal of remedies, though.  Most definitely.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Terrific, Natalie!  So glad to hear it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought corn was over for the season... I am happy to think I am wrong!  I missed corn this season.  Somehow I was just looking the other way and all the good corn days slipped right by me.   But, alas... perhaps not too late afterall!  I will try it this week.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Every try fresh ginger tea on the tum?  I peel a huge piece and slice it up (1/2 -1 cup at least) and boil it in a small pan of water.
