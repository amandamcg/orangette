					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a long-time &#039;lurker&#039; but have recently joined the blog fray. Love your site (and wish you all the best with the wedding)! On morels, wondered if you had read Barbara Kingsolver&#039;s &quot;Animal Vegetable Miracle&quot;? She has a receipe for Asparagus and Morel Bread Pudding (http://animalvegetablemiracle.com/BREAD%20PUDDING.pdf).  Thought it sounded good but after reading your post, I think I prefer the simplicity of yours that really showcases the morels. I&#039;d love to try them but haven&#039;t been able to find them anywhere (is it because I&#039;m in Canada?).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had to report back that I went straight to the forager and snapped up a big bag of morels, threatened by the heat wave and their absence next week.  So morel week at our house consisted of a pasta with sauteed shallots, morels, sea beans and a bit of cream, with shards of assiago.  i had bought a few giant ones and stuffed them with chevre and herbs and roasted them.  heaven, i tell you.  there are a few wobbly ones left, perfect for toast for lunch tomorrow, just for me.  my family tells me they are tired of funghi - i just can&#039;t comprehend this!]]></description>
