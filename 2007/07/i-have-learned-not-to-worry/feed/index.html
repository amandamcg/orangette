					<description><![CDATA[Apparently it &lt;&gt;really&lt;&gt; resonated with me - what I wrote under the just-posted photo of Ali and me matches the mood and pace of your ruminating here in this post very closely!  And then the final words are so similar!  Wow, I didn&#039;t mean for that to happen -- milestones do get us all thoughtful, don&#039;t they? &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you SO much for your excitement and encouragement!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heya - I&#039;ve wanted for a long time to say how much I loved this post.  I remember reading it last summer and deeply appreciating how honest it was - about the hugeness and seriousness of what you were doing.  Rereading it I&#039;m grateful again.  It helps remind me that all these details really will get worked out and become something very lovely indeed ... and also, well, I can&#039;t think better how to say it ... how you say it really resonates with me.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;(Welcome back!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I saw the little piece on FoodNetwork that they air during comercials about you and Brandon. It took me a moment to realize it was you, until I saw the shot of you reading the blog. Brandon is such a cutie and you, dear Molly are so very lucky. May you botht have much happiness and be blessed with many children.]]></description>
