					<description><![CDATA[No problem, Julie!  By &quot;strips of lemon zest,&quot; yes, I do mean thin strips of lemon rind.  I shave them off with a paring knife, taking just the yellow rind and not the white pith.  Hope you enjoy it...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Big congrats on your upcoming Big Day, Molly! And thanks for taking the time to post your special lemonade special. Think I&#039;ll give it a whirl (one for the kids, one for me, er, properly enhanced with vodka).&lt;/&gt;But I have a stupid bad home cook question: *strips* of lemon zest? What&#039;s that? Do you mean thin strips of lemon rind? Can somebody reading these comments fill me in? Sorry, I&#039;m a total neophyte on these matters. Cheers! Julie&lt;/&gt;www.badhomecooking.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i tried my darndest to be the MOST un-obnoxious bride in history.  and i think i succeeded.  probably mostly because our wedding was so very simple &amp; laid back.  i didn&#039;t even consider wearing a veil.  my shoes were flip-flops from old navy.  my flowers were daisies.  i got married in a park.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;as long as you are doing what YOU want to do &amp; makes YOU happy, don&#039;t worry what anyone says or thinks :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this just last week!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I was thinking about trying it with cilantro instead of basil.  And also trying to figure out how to use grapefruit instead of lemons. Not that I don&#039;t like lemonade -- it&#039;s just that grapefruit and cilantro sounds awfully appealing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your wedding &lt;&gt;is&lt;&gt; a party, one of the biggest you&#039;ll ever throw (not necessarily just because of the guest list but because it is, you know, a rather important day).  So of course there are details and bits that make you go &quot;blaaaagh!&quot;.  But as a wise priest once told me, &quot;If you show up and he shows up and I show up, then by the end of the day, you&#039;ll be married&quot;.  That&#039;s all it takes, the rest is just for fun.  Do try to have fun with it and promise yourself to be present at your own wedding.  (You don&#039;t know how many women I know who have virtually no recollection of the day because they were so obsessed with details).  Have fun, love him and enjoy yourself.  That&#039;s a pretty good recipe for a successful marriage, too!]]></description>
