					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://orangette.net/2007/07/all-so-pretty/#comment-60751&quot;&gt;Shula&lt;/a&gt;.

Shula, I didn&#039;t scale up this recipe much to make my wedding cakes. I made only two at a time, I think, because I only had that many pans. In any case, the recipe doubles beautifully, and I&#039;ll bet you could scale it up even higher with no problem. For a gluten-free version, I think the best and easiest solution is to replace the flour with unsweetened cocoa powder. Go for it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello! I know this was a very long time ago, but I&#039;m planning on making my own wedding cake (with a twist: gluten free). Did you make any changes to the gÃ¢teau au chocolat fondant when you scaled it up for production? I don&#039;t anticipate it being difficult to do gluten-free, with such a small amount of flour being called for, but I was thinking of doing 1 tbsp all-purpose GF flour plus another tbsp of almond meal to add a little more stability? Any advice is greatly appreciated!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received your lovely book as a present recently from someone who knows just how much I love your blog :) I just finished making the pickled carrot recipe, and I was quite alarmed when the garlic turned a bright as the summer sky blue. I read something about why this happens (the sulfates in the garlic reacting with copper in the water/vinegar/pan/etc), but I&#039;m not sure what can be done to prevent this! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have any wise words of wisdom for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love your blog, and so happy for all the happiness that has found you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XOXO Danielle]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wendi, I just asked Brandon about this, since he&#039;s the main pickler in the house, and he says that you can reuse the brine.  Absolutely. You can either:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) use it cold.  Prepare your carrots, put them in jars, and cover with cold brine.  They will take longer to absorb the brine and taste right than they would if the brine was hot, but it should work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) warm it slightly.  Put your prepared carrots in a microwaveable bowl.  Add the brine.  Microwave briefly, just until the brine and the carrots are warm.  This will encourage the carrots to start to absorb the brine faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you just don&#039;t want to reheat it on the stove, because boiling it again would change its flavor balance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, hope you check your older posts for comments since I couldn&#039;t find a newer reference on the site for the pickled carrots.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;m wondering what you do with the brine once the carrots are all gone.  Do you think it is safe to reuse for another batch?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Finally. Your life together has been christened by, I&#039;m sure, a truly lovely event.  I hope it was all that you hoped for. Now, relax.  Unwind.  Breathe.  Take it all in.  Enjoy this new beginning.  On the day of your wedding, there was only one moment in the universe that was yours alone--with the two of you, surrounded by those you love, speaking words of love and commitment.  For so many other people, it was an ordinary day, the world continued turning.  But for you, this was a moment in time, where time stood still--pausing, as if to take note.  A lovely thing has occurred, two lives have become one.  It is a marvelous thing.  Congradulations.]]></description>
