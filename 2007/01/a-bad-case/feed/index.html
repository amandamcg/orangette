					<description><![CDATA[My whole family was blown away by this soup. My 5YO and 1YO both had seconds leaving no seconds for the DH and I. :( &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#039;t have enough celery root so I add one baked potato at the end and we also added chopped parsley instead of chervil. This was marvelous. The color was gorgeous and the texture was wonderful. I would also add that using a hand blender made it extremely easy to blend in the pot instead of blender/food processor. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another recipe hit that the whole family enjoyed!!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just tried this for the first time the other day, inspired by this post and an article about root vegetables in the last food issue of the New Yorker---it was great! Will definitely be making again. Loved the smell of the celery root when dicing it...filled up the whole house.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had an over abundance of celery root from our CSA and made this soup.  Everyone loved it.  We had it for one meal just as your recipe was written.  For the next meal I added some seafood to the soup(bay scallops,shrimp &amp; surimi). It was delicious.  Made a lovely dinner.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, I tried this one with turnips a few days ago. In place of the celery root here, I used 2 medium sized turnips. I peeled the turnips (one advantage: they&#039;re a LOT easier to peel than celery root) and cubed them just like one would cube the celery root. The resulting soup was near-identical in texture to the original, but the color was different. It was a tan-ish brown instead of the pale green version that the celery root produced. That&#039;s to be expected, I suppose. As far as taste goes, the turnip flavor was a little pronounced, but it really wasn&#039;t bad. Ordinarily, I don&#039;t much like turnips, but I simmered the soup for about three hours before pureeing, and the flavor mellowed out and smoothed into something different than what I usually associate with turnips. It was still earthy, and you could tell that you were eating root vegetable, but it didn&#039;t scream &#039;TURNIP!&#039; to me, as many turnip dishes do. Overall, I think I liked the celery root version a little better, but the turnip version was very successful. I tested it on my family (who were visiting over Christmas), and my mother liked the turnip version better than the celery root version, so they were close enough that the difference  may come down to personal taste. I would certainly make it again (there are a few turnips waiting in my crisper as I type), and I&#039;m thinking about topping it with cheddar or Parmesan next time: it seems like it might take the cheese flavor well.]]></description>
