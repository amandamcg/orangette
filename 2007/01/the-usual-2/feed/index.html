					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I know you wrote this post 3 years ago, but I always go to you first when looking for a recipe.  This was a great one, as usual.&lt;br /&gt;I know you get hundreds of comments on every blog post, but I just wanted you to know how much your blog has meant to me.  I am not overstating things when i say that it has changed my life.  Yours was the first blog I ever read, about a year and a half ago.  I loved it.  I was inspired to start my own and began a journey that has been incredibly rewarding and fulfilling.  So thanks.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I linked to the recipe on my blog, Picnics in the Park, but gave you full credit, of course.  Probably that marmalade cake will be next!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again, Molly for following your heart and dreams.&lt;br /&gt;Greta]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[God, I love scones.  Really, they&#039;re my favorite baked sweet item.  Thing is, I don&#039;t have one recipe that I think is the ultimate platonic example of a scone.  I wish I did, but I actually like most types, except the very sweet, leaden ones.  I&#039;d like to try the macrina recipe for sure, and I&#039;ll go look up your sister&#039;s as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, as far as I know there was only Seattle Scone Girl mix available. It was produced by a local woman, using her family recipe.  I used to find it at Met Market (then Thriftway) and occasionally QFC.  They sold the company to Fisher Fair Scones, and I haven&#039;t seen it on the shelves since.  I bought my last batch at the space needle gift shop, if you can beleive it, when I had out of towners here.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;This link tells the story, but the links to the company no longer work.  http://www.therecipereader.com/sg-scones.htm]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The new recipe sounds delicious - as does the old. I&#039;m a nostaligic and loyal baker too.  I find subcategorizing helps - I&#039;d never prepare your sister&#039;s recipe with fennel seeds and currants or the scones nouveau with crystalized ginger or one of her other specialties.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Long time lurker and big fan here, I just had to drop you a line and let you know that I laughed aloud at your post. I am totally the same way -- I&#039;ve been making the same oatmeal cookie recipe since I was twelve. I discovered the recipe in Joy of Cooking, modified it, loved it, and never looked back. You&#039;ve inspired me to try the next good looking oatmeal cookie recipe I run across. Thanks!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kristel &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;(www.thebestsoupever.blogspot.com)]]></description>
