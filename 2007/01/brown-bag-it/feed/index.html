					<description><![CDATA[As I stared at the uninspiring contents of my pantry, my gaze came to rest on a can of long forgotten chickpeas.  Damn, what was that yummy salad I used to make from a recipe on Orangette way back when.  A simple search and there it was, from 2007!  Thank you for the inspiration that still makes us happy 7 years later. Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, came across your blog a while ago. Keep following it ever since. Really loved this chickpea salad and also the soba noodles. Also made your roasted rhubarb recipe several times last spring. I am from Switzerland, but spent a year in Oklahoma for a high school exchange program and later worked in other parts of the U.S. for a while. Love staying connected to the U.S. culinary scene through your and other blogs. Orangette is my favorite though, your writing and the aestethic of your blog are outstanding!]]></description>
