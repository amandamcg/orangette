					<description><![CDATA[This is quite an old post, but I merely wanted to comment after I noticed that you wrote that Peter Fortunato was your professor at one time... WOW! I only just had him last semester, and I found him amazing... I could completely imagine him saying exactly what you had said, with that enthusiasm of his.. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Not sure if you&#039;ll ever read this comment, but I thought, why not? hehe..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly - the book sounds just delicious. I cannot wait to read it! And I can&#039;t tell you how much I just nodded my head at your description of writing. Oh, so much..it&#039;s all so very true. I&#039;m in the place right now (I think our deadlines are close to each other) where I&#039;m going frantically between glee at how it&#039;s all coming together, and absoulute horror at how it&#039;s NOT coming together. Frightening when I go back and forth on a near hourly basis at this point. ;)&lt;/&gt; Wishing you well as you keep on writing!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your blog is always so gorgeous and inspiring, Molly. I have no doubt that your book will be even moreso. Congratulations, and happy writing! Thanks so much for the soup recipe as well!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, &lt;/&gt;I look forward to your book so much - I hope there are repeats from your blog, as it would be great to have them in paper form, too. My kitchen has too few counters for my laptop to find space when I cook, so I always have recipes from blogs scrawled on the back of a scrap of paper as my guide. By the way, I have made your warm butternut squash &amp; chickpea salad w/tahini 2 times now.  It was very popular at the potluck I took it to on Friday - I came home with only 2 lone chickpeas rattling around the container.  By the end, everyone was taking large bites directly out off the serving spoon. That dressing is funny - it never tastes quite right on its own (too much lemon?) but on the squash, it&#039;s perfect - almost tastes like yogurt with its tang.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good luck with the book! I&#039;m a first time poster, but I hosted a dinner party last night that was full of Orangette recipes with great success. Vinegar-roasted shallots as an appetizer, and roast sausages and grapes for dinner alongside braised winter greesn with chickpeas and garlic. Delicious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Delurking to say hello. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The photo of your kitchen provoked a Proustian moment for me. After my husband and I were married, we splurged and bought some of the items from our registry that we hadn&#039;t received as gifts, including that very sculptural Calphalon tea kettle. Over time, hard water pitted the interior and we had to chuck it. Our current tea kettle is serviceable but nowhere near as attractive.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m really looking forward to reading your book when it&#039;s released. All best as you work toward &quot;delivery&quot; date.]]></description>
