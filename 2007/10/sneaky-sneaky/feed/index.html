					<description><![CDATA[10 years later and this may still be the best salad in the world! I visited Morito (Moro&#039;s sister) in London last week and had this salad and I have been searching for a recipe to recreate it since I got home. 
How I love the internet. Thank you so much for this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This salad was so good!  I didn&#039;t have tahini, so I substituted some prepared basic hummus and stirred that into the dressing with 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest.  I will definitely make this again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this last night but I messed up the dressing entirely so instead i quartered 2 onions and roasted them with the squash to add moisture. I laid the salad on a bed of lemon fragrant rice to add bulk and added a dollop of hummus on the side. Beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;My own blog http://thecreamteadiaries.blogspot.co.uk/&lt;br /&gt;twitter https://twitter.com/#!/CreamTeaDiaries]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was lovely! I did, however, add much more lemon juice and some green salad leaves which resulted in a fresher, lighter tasting version. Another keeper recipe from the Orangette! Thanks! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. scattering some pumpkin and/or sunflower seeds works really well too!]]></description>
