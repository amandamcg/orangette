					<description><![CDATA[Late to the party here as well!  I made a batch of these delicious cookies tonight.  Ten seems to be the lucky number of minutes in my oven.  Spoonfuls slightly more than a tablespoon gave me 27 cookies.  I have a feeling I&#039;m going to have to make more before taking them to work on Thursday. 

Also, all I had was nonfat Greek yogurt, and it worked just fine.  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, I know that this is such a late comment after you posted, but I&#039;m so intrigued about yoghurt as an ingredient in cookies. I&#039;ve almost always got yoghurt on hand, but unfortunately I&#039;ve got low fat in the fridge at the moment. How do you think it would affect the end result?]]></description>
