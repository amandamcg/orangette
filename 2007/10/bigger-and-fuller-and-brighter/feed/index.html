					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m late to the party!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to say...I have been cooking my way through your list of recipes for a few months now, and I&#039;m in love with your food perspective.  My parents were foodies, but of the brut-hardcore, old-world New England meatasaurus style...lots of finicky French cream sauce bases, 20 lb roast beefs, etc etc...and that is all well and wonderful (childhood holiday memories will attest), but it&#039;s, you know, a bit overwhelming when you&#039;re first on your own in a tiny apartment kitchen with a limited big city supermarket budget and schedule, and some new-school health and animal well-being concerns.  I love your recipes, and your approach in general.  I keep singing your praises to anyone who&#039;ll listen, and even though I&#039;m late to the party I feel like this is the perfect time to have found ya--I just snapped up your (fairly new) book, and get excited every time I see it in a walk-in bookstore (!), I discovered your marriage story just shortly after getting engaged myself, and I really Spring and Summer are your time to shine (all those wonderful salads boasting fresh flavor and produce bounties!).  You talk a couple times about turning to certain food experts with the hope they can make it all better, make it simple, make it foolproof now that you&#039;re on your own.  I totally hear you, and--ta-da!--you along with Beth Hensperger and Joyce Goldstein have proved to be those kind of comforting resources to me.  I have yet to make a single dish you&#039;ve mentioned that wasn&#039;t delicious and easy.  I don&#039;t have that kind of track record with ANYBODY--not even the Chris Kimball and crew or Mark Bittman.  It is awesome, and I salute you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It has been cold &amp; raining/snowing(!) here the last few days. I made this wonderful recipe again and it was perfect for the weather.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I find eating it with a spoon as well as knife and fork is best - a spoon ensures the scrumptious sauce, compote &amp; brat are present in every bite. I find for two that the compote is enough for two meals.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks Molly!&lt;/&gt;c2c&lt;/&gt;from your honeymoon Island]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly - do you know you have been mentioned in an article about food blogs in the English magazine The Week (&#039;the best of the British and foreign media&#039;) of 1 December?  In case you can&#039;t get a copy, it says:&lt;/&gt;&#039;This addictive blog is the work of Molly, a &quot;pretty redhead&quot; from Seattle, who seems to live for food.  She has an easy, informal style that is both &quot;witty and eloquent&quot; (she won the best writing category in last year&#039;s Food Blog Awards), and her &quot;mouthwatering&quot; recipes are brought to life with &quot;beautiful photography&quot;.  She is currently hard at work on her own cookbook.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The words in &quot; &quot; are taken from other write-ups, as this magazine is a sort of digest of the world&#039;s media.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I was so thrilled to see my favourite food writer at the top of the list, where she surely belongs!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Love from your fan Elizabeth]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just started reading your blog a few months ago and love it.  I made the brats and apples for some friends last night.  They were a huge hit!!  My apples turned out much creamier (oops), but it all worked out and got rave reviews.  Someone told me about the European Sausage shop on Olympic (if there are any other Angelenos reading) - and their fresh-made sausages were divine.  Thanks for the recipe!  And all the great stories, photos, inspiration, etc... good luck with your book!]]></description>
