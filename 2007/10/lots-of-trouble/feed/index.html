					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, thank you, thank you! You should call this Danger Sauce because I ate way too much cappellini in an effort to consume as much sauce as possible. I used Plugra instead of regular butter, to great effect. My new desert island kit includes San Marzano tomatoes, Plugra, an onion, and some pasta.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is my first time commenting on your lovely blog. &lt;/&gt;I am not a chef, (my husband is a fabulous cook) but I am definitely a foodie. When I get a bee in my bonnet and decide to venture into the kitchen, I want to make something yummy and EASY. So thank you for the inspiration for this fantastic salad. I changed it a little...only because I didn&#039;t have a white vinegar so I used lemon juice and made a tangy vinaigrette which worked well with the DELICIOUS pear I used, and I used ricotta salata instead of parmesan, but that&#039;s only because I love ricotta salata and use it whenever possible. The end result was delicious. My mouth is watering thinking about it, so I guess I&#039;ll have to make it again tomorrow. :)&lt;/&gt;Thanks again!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes things just don&#039;t work out and that&#039;s all there is to it -it just happens that way sometimes.  At least you can salvage it by making applesauce -  sounds like a fantastic accompaniment for roast pork!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry your apple dessert didn&#039;t turn out as planned, but that was such a funny post :-) I&#039;ll have to try this salad, though...mmm.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And by the way, some of my favourite simple recipes come from your site, especially the chickpea salad with lemon and parmesan.  Simple but not too simple.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I run into the same trouble because I want my food to be very easy .. no fool proof. I&#039;m not a great cook, but so often what I make tastes like nothing. The salad sounds delicious though. See... redeemed. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Vida, I would &lt;&gt;love&lt;&gt; to see your recipe!  Would you really e-mail it?  That would be wonderful.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Mercedes, thank you for posting your cake!  You were smart to increase the sugar, lady.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And thank you to those who&#039;ve asked to hear more about the book!  I&#039;d love to tell you about my process, and I&#039;ve been meaning to for a while, in fact.  The whole thing feels sort of overwhelming at the moment - a little disorganized, and more than a little daunting! - but it would be fun to write about for next week&#039;s post.   Stay tuned...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;In the meantime, thank you all for understanding why I can&#039;t reply to every comment these days.  Eeep!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had a heartbreaking experience with an orange-flavored cornmeal/olive oil cake just last night.  I think my pan was too big (9&quot;, recipe called for 8&quot;), but it was all hilly around the edges and the center slumped in.  I&#039;ve switched pan sizes before with no problem--usually you just end up with a thinner cake.  Not this time.  My thought are with you in your hour of need (although likely you&#039;ve recovered by now--I hope :) ).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I once had a recipe that added 3 tbsp of salt to 3 lb tomatoes while slow roasting. Since that was my first time slow roasting and didn&#039;t know much about it, I went with it...little did I know that batch was never to see the light of the day(and yes, I tasted one....and drank like a gallon of water later)]]></description>
