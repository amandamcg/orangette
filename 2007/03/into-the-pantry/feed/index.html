					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://orangette.net/2007/03/into-the-pantry/#comment-76964&quot;&gt;Brenna&lt;/a&gt;.

I just came across your comment and it made me smile. I too relied on mjadara last year during the pandemic. Out of boredom and practicality.  I ate tons of lentils and cabbage . Mainly mjadara and sauerkraut.  It was only this week that I was courageous enough to cook some more lentils and gosh I don&#039;t regret it]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been making this recipe for years, returning every time I needed a refresher on the ratios, but never left a comment. Perfect pantry staple for these stay-at-home times. Thanks for sharing this - it&#039;s kept me and mine happy &#038; fed for the better part of a decade.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just found this blog when following a link for a peppermint bark recipe (thanks!).  For mujadara, I&#039;ve had a recipe from my best friend&#039;s husband&#039;s mother, who was Lebanese and a wonderful cook. It calls for a pinch of cloves stirred in with the onions after the lentils and rice are cooked.  Some of the caramelized onions are reserved to top off each serving.  It&#039;s delicious! And one of my winter staples. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think a friend of mine has been working his way back through your archives -- he just posted a wonderful picture of this with a link and a note to add nutmeg if you&#039;re out of basmati and have to use brown rice. The two of you combined have me drooling.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made mujadara tonight, and I was digging through the web for other variations when I stumbled upon this older post of yours. So hello! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, the recipe that inspired me to make mujadara tonight had the strangest ingredient: buttermilk. I omitted it because the idea of mujadara with a cheesy aftertaste just didn&#039;t sound appetizing, and I&#039;d never seen a mujadara recipe calling for it. Have you ever heard of such a thing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made the Mujadara and it is absolutely fabulous!! As you suggested I patiently caramelized the onions, stirring them lovingly for about 35 minutes. Can&#039;t wait to have some for lunch tomorrow as well, to see how the flavors develop. Thanks again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You have such a beautiful blog. I love your style of writing. Couldn&#039;t wait to read the actual recipe. I&#039;m so glad I stumbled upon it and I can&#039;t wait to try your recipe for Mujadara. It will have to wait until the weekend though, when I can give enough attention to caramelizing those onions! Ohh....I&#039;m excited!! Thank you for sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OH MY GOD, this recipe is so wonderful and simple!!! I come very late to the Mujadara party, but I needed to tell you how much I enjoyed this. I made a few mods following some of the comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- made twice as many onions, and serve half of them as a garnish on top. (I&#039;m a bit obsessed with caramelized onions.)&lt;br /&gt;- added half a stick of cinnamon and 1 tsp. of cumin at the &quot;rice&quot; stage.&lt;br /&gt;- added lemon and a bit of fleur de sel at the end&lt;br /&gt;- served with wedges of za&#039;atar-sprinkled toasted pitas, and a cucumber/mint salad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO SO SO GOOD!!!! Perfect autumn dish.]]></description>
