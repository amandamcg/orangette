					<description><![CDATA[I had a bunch of carrots in the &#039;fridge that were nearing expiry, and soup was not an option in this 28 degree weather!  So, on a hunch, I went to your recipe index.  My husband and I have eaten this 3 times in the last week, and love love LOVE it.  Thanks so much, Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Austrian Airways does serve very good food &amp; stunning desserts and some REAL bread! n general, the food in European Airlines tends to be better than American airlines - which is not saying much I know! ( Unless you land a bummer like Alitalia - dont know why anyone at all will fly this airline run by Thugs &amp; thieves!)&lt;br /&gt;But the portions are tiny - really tiny to sustain anyone on long distances!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My girlfriend and I have been making something very similar to the fritata for a protein-laden breakfast after our morning workout.  We&#039;re looking greatly forward to the U-Dist market to fire back up to start really playing with the ingredients.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;http://cooklocal.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!8EA3FDF3A5125398!211.entry&lt;/&gt;and&lt;/&gt;http://cooklocal.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!8EA3FDF3A5125398!188.entry are our first two reviews of our efforts.  We never thought about bringing them on a flight...  Now I want to travel again.... =)]]></description>
