					<description><![CDATA[Fab cookies!  I made these over the weekend during a particularly strong rush of domesticity.  They are just as you described: chewy, soft and crispy cracked on top.  My in-laws thank you :)  I&#039;m making another batch today and am using half golden syrup, half treacle because it&#039;s hard to find light molasses where I live (good old Dublin) and as you predicted, they were a bit too Christmasy for June when I used molasses in the last batch.  You&#039;re the best!  Thanks for sharing your kitchen genius with us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I started making these cookies a few years ago. They are most certainly my favorite and a definite must-bake during the holidays (and always a favorite at cookies swaps). I highly recommend letting the dough sit overnight or even 2-3 before baking off the cookies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ena, I hope this reply isn&#039;t too late!  I don&#039;t know much about substituting honey for molasses, but I don&#039;t imagine it would change the texture, no.  That&#039;s my best guess!  It would certainly change the flavor, though, so that&#039;s something to keep in mind.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I avoid baking at most costs, but w/ the first snow of the season and Thanksgiving around the corner, I awoke thinking about trying to bake ginger chocolate chip cookies and went in search of a recipe.  I knew just what I wanted to make and rejected countless recipes before stumbling upon yours--there it was!  Exactly what I was envisioning.  I&#039;m the 5th of 6 kids so know all about delayed gratification--glad it led me to persist in finding this recipe.  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just had guests for dinner and everyone proclaimed these cookies to be outstanding.  I substituted two tablespoons of cocoa for some of the flour in memory of a fabulous Martha Stewart ginger and chocolate chip cookie recipe I had made many years ago.  I think the cocoa added a slight depth of flavour that is not really noticeable yet makes a difference.  This cookie has the perfect balance of flavours and texture.  Thanks for the recipe...and the story of its many predecessors.]]></description>
