					<description><![CDATA[I made Heidi&#039;s Salsa of the Year (http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/000325.html) (2005!!) a month or so ago and it was pretty awesome but maybe not what I had imagined it to be. I can&#039;t wait to try this! Also, I would like to respectfully add to the chorus of requests for the coconut pie recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting this recipe. I&#039;ve been making a bunch of hot sauces recently and gave this one a shot. Turned out awesome although I seem to have glanced over the part about browning the pumpin and sesame seeds and deseeding the Chiles but I have enough to try a second batch more closely following the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After making the sauce I decided to make some black/pinto bean dip and used 1 Tbsp. of the pressings and this has got to be the best bean dip ever. I&#039;ve copied the recipe below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2 Pound black beans&lt;br /&gt;1/2 Pound pinto beans&lt;br /&gt;1 onion diced fine&lt;br /&gt;1 lemon&lt;br /&gt;1 lime&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup cilantro chopped fine&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp cumin&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp celery powder&lt;br /&gt;1 tspc orriander&lt;br /&gt;salt to taste&lt;br /&gt;1 tsp. pepper&lt;br /&gt;Secret Ingredient - 1 Tbsp.  pressings from Rick Bayless&#039; Chile De Arbol sauce recipe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put beans in a pot with water in a 4:1 (water to bean) ratio and bring to boil, turn off and let sit for an hour. Change water while reserving 2-3 cups for later use bring new water and beans to a boil for 1/2 hour or until tender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add beans in batches to blender or foor processor and puree using the reserved water. Result should be a smooth consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove to a bowl and combine ingredients. Adding water for a smoother consistency as desired. Serve warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it could probably use a bit more of the pressing but I tend to go overboard sometimes and decided to limit myself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This looks delicious, but how does one find raw pumpkin seeds (short of carving one&#039;s own pumpkin)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello from Toronto, Canada.  &lt;/&gt;I&#039;ve been trying to find &quot;dry&quot; chiles (de Arbol) and did, in a market today.  They are DRY, ie. brittle.  Is that how they&#039;re supposed to be?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Best,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;SabinaKatrina]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Victoria, we&#039;ve got to find you some arbol chiles!  Hmm. Did you try a Mexican or Latin American grocery?  I&#039;m sure they&#039;d have them.  I&#039;ve even bought them at Whole Foods, in the aisle where they have various Mexican products and canned chiles.  Hop to it!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Otherwise, though, Brandon wants me to assure you that he thinks most any dried chile will work - it&#039;s just that the flavor and heat will be different.  You could always give it a go...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry for the double post Molly, but now I have a chile question. I looked all over Manhattan for arbol chiles or any of the equivalents listed on a chile thesaurus I found but to no avail, so have settled for some thin red ones that were labelled only &quot;red indian chiles.&quot; Do you have any idea if these are a worthy substitute or should I keep up the search? Perhaps Brandon has experimented with others, Ancho was what I found the most of. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rave reviews!  Miss13, that&#039;s what I like to hear.  So glad you like it!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Victoria, that&#039;s a great question.  We actually really like Bragg&#039;s too.  You can use most any brand, so long as it&#039;s *real* apple cider vinegar.  You wouldn&#039;t believe how many brands say &quot;distilled vinegar with apple flavoring&quot; on the label.  Grrr.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, I was wondering if you have a preferred brand of apple cider vinegar?  I lean towards Bragg but am going to try making this and want it to be the best it can be!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree it changes over time, I think maybe the apple cider vinegar &quot;sets in&quot;. I served it along with some vegan green goddess pizza this weekend and everyone gave it rave reviews ^_^&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I will definitely be making another batch ! Thank you for sharing !!&lt;/&gt;(plus I counted and we have 7 hot sauces for now ;))]]></description>
