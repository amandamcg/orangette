I&#039;ve only frozen the baked cookies, but you could also freeze the dough.  Either way!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, Long-time lurker, first time commenter! Love your blog. You mentioned freezing the cookies. Did you freeze the baked cookies or the cookie dough? These look great as party favors for my husband&#039;s big birthday. But, I&#039;m looking for recipes that I can bake as far out in advance as possible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are delicious and everyone who has tried them has loved them, although my daughter says she would prefer chocolate chips. I made them with gluten free flour mix replacing the wheat flour and that worked well. Thank you for this recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So this week we got a (beautiful) new (to us) fridge, and yesterday we finished transferring everything from the old to the new. And in the back of our old freezer I found a quarter log of these cookies! I do not remember when we made them -- praying it was not actually 2007. I&#039;m testing their mettle by baking them up now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aria, I don&#039;t think I would put candied ginger in these.  I think it would overpower the delicate flavor of the buckwheat, and I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m just afraid it wouldn&#039;t taste &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt;, you know?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I&#039;ve been dying to make these cookies. I need to make some &quot;asian inspired&quot; cookies for a big event this week. How do you think these would be with a little candied ginger thrown in with the cocoa nibs?]]></description>
