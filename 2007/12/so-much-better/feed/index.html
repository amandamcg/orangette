					<description><![CDATA[This recipe was amazing. The combination of the brown butter, vanilla, sugar, and just a little bit of jam takes me right back to the jam cookies of my childhood.  I just tried it as a thank you gift to my preceptors (I am in nurse-midwifery school).  I can&#039;t wait to make these again for myself!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these for the first time the other day, using melted chocolate instead of jam and brought them to a committee meeting. They were devoured within minutes and I had two friends arguing over who could have the privalege of marrying me. Molly these are fantastic. Time consuming, but well worth it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[oh, this is the first time i&#039;ve tried one of your baking recipes, molly, and it was SO good! my coworkers have been giving me that wide-eyed frantic &quot;give-me-recipe&quot; look after the first bite.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;i found that baking to a warm golden brown gave my cookie a couple more points for flavor. I&#039;m definitely using a variety of jams next time. Or maybe this cookie is just a delicious excuse to go jam collecting...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, thank you for reading my mind - I was thinking about that article not two weeks ago (is it really from years ago?). I loved the author&#039;s description of the cookie and how special they were to her. I&#039;m so happy to have the recipe again and will make them this time - thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Molly (and Beth)&lt;/&gt;I had the same problem as Beth with these cookies.  They are so delicate that I am unable to pick them up without them falling apart. I followed recipe closely and everything seemed to work perfectly until the end.  Anyone else having this problem?  Any ideas?  It seems like such a great idea.  &lt;/&gt;Thanks!]]></description>
