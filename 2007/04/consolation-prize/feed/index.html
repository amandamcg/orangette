					<description><![CDATA[This has become a family favorite!  My husband and I ADORE this soup.  I&#039;m making it tonight, yet again.  Thank you!!  Also, here&#039;s a link to a recipe passed down to me by my aunt.  It&#039;s coconut custard pie.  Not sure if it&#039;s exactly what you had in mind, but we love it (and it&#039;s super easy to make, too).  :-)&lt;br /&gt;http://flashbangfibers.blogspot.com/2010/05/coconut-custard-pie.html]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made this, and it&#039;s delicious and somehow meaty.  I followed the idea you floated, Molly, about halving the butter and adding the spices to the softening onions and garlic.  Best lentil soup I&#039;ve had in a long time!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My boyfriend and I fell ill on the same afternoon. After work, wondering up the huge hill that took me twice as long to climb today, I pursued a tasty soup recipe from my favorite food blog. And again, you did not let me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added some leftover roasted chicken and substituted chicken stock, and it was absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend looked up from his empty bowl and said, &quot;this soup is better than I deserve, I&#039;ve been so lazy.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny, this soup is so easy, that&#039;s just how I felt!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We had this soup for dinner tonight, and it was delicious!  I discovered your blog this evening while searching for a green lentil soup recipe.  What a delightful surprise!  I loved reading the story of how you met your husband and about your background and current successes in publishing.  I also look forward to trying out your Seattle recommendations when I&#039;m in the area next summer.  I&#039;ll be back soon to read more of your blog.]]></description>
