					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly - I just read your last post while coming to this site for this recipe. I made it the Christmas after it was posted, and I wanted to make it again this year. Like you I&#039;ve had a lot of changes in the years in between, life focus has changed, loved ones have been lost.  It is one of the best things about food - which is basically the theme of your food writing - that food is a constant in an ever changing world and life. 

Thank you for all of your work here, for all that you&#039;ve shared with us, and for keeping it here for reference. I miss your voice but am delighted that you&#039;re still writing.  All the best to you Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made the lemon cake and I completely understand what you mean about if it&#039;s too dry that it&#039;s hell on earth.  I was very grateful about the glaze, for sure, when I made it this week.  The cake I made was just borderline, you know?  Anyway, I&#039;m a new reader and just wanted to say thanks and hello.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[And I thought my recent disasters were all down to my pregnancy... Well, actually they are, and my lack of bloggin is attributable to that too. 3 months of &#039;full moon&#039; so far, I hope to snap out of them pretty soon and my husband is looking forward to that too...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi-&lt;/&gt;I think that you got that how to cook hard-cooked eggs info from me! I&#039;m a cookbook author (missing IACP this year or I&#039;d look you up) and last year my &quot;The Farmstead Egg Cookbook&quot; came out. Around Easter I was interviewed by a number of different newspapers, so perhaps you saw the method there.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;ve got hens in my backyard and am very fussy about eggs!&lt;/&gt;Check out my Web site (I&#039;ve got a live streaming Web cam in my coop - silly fun) and I write a blog about all things chicken. www.hencam.com.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Does it make you feel any better if I say that the Asparagus vinaigrette is quite yummy?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I think we&#039;ve all had awful weeks like that. By far my most horrific memory was not timing the additions of various vegetable for a soup I was making correctly out of nervousness (I sort of dumped them all in) and discovering that the broccoli had turned to mush. My rice noodles also turned mushy.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;This was the first meal I ever cooked for my in-laws and after my husband mentioned how much I liked to cook, my brother-in-law snarked &quot;she really needs to practice more then&quot; It really damaged my ego.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I laughed when I read this because I just had that same thing happen to me 2 weeks ago. I made 3 things that no matter how hard I pretended, I couldn&#039;t post about them. The kicker was  a zucchini/avocado soup that despite being very photogenic,  turned out to just be a big bowl of guacamole -- which we ate anyway. There&#039;s a reason why people don&#039;t tuck away that much guacamole in one sitting!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anyway -- glad that you shared this with us, and the asparagus dish just went on my list of recipes to try.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Molly. All good cooks have weeks like that at some time or other.  Not to worry.  You still rock! Just saw the video from the Food Channel and loved it!  You two are so cute!  And not blinky at all, despite your nerves! &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Have a stellar weekend!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Pam]]></description>
