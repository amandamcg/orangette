					<description><![CDATA[My grandmother and my mother made similar biscuits but they had a large enamel pan that was kept with flour in it.  Every morning they made biscuits by making a well in the center of the flour then scooping a small ball of shortening out with their fingers and placing it in the well.  They then worked the shortening into the flour as they poured the buttermilk in at the same time.  They always made a high pan that held over a dozen but never measured anything and never had any dough left over.  When the dough came together they pinched bits off and rolled them in their floured hands then place them in the pan a patted them a little to flatten.  I can&#039;t make them this way I have to measure but they sure were good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly. I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re still receiving comments for this post or if I&#039;m sending this question off to the vast emptiness of the Internet, but if you do get this I have a biscuit question for you... I&#039;ve made these from your recipe once before on a Thanksgiving many years ago, probably before I had kids and definitely before my husband and I decided to invite both of our families for the first T-Day we&#039;ve ever hosted (our bold act of hubris this year). I recall them being beyond amazing. This year I&#039;m on a mission to make lots of them, and am wondering if you&#039;ve ever made these ahead, frozen the dough and then baked them straight from the freezer? I&#039;m nervous about doing it that way without having ever tried before, but can&#039;t give up the dream of serving these this year! 
For anyone who&#039;s read this far... Thanks for indulging my comment novella. If it&#039;s not obvious, my post-election sadness and anxiety is taking the form of an all-consuming biscuit obsession.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are my absolute fav biscuits, light and fluffy and not sweet at all to my taste (and I don&#039;t like sweet rolls so I would notice). The recipe I got for these calls for 1.5 c of white lily and just a TB of sugar, I use a scant TB ... just yummy and so easy!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE your blog and loved your book! Molly, you have a way of making me want to try everything you write about! ;)&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made these.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are phenomenal, and the act of gently tossing them or even pursing your lips for a moment and blowing off the flour made me feel... artful.  There&#039;s something restorative about it.  Just loved it, thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I also found these disappointing, but it may be my fault for making a substitution. They came out quite wet in the center, after 20 minutes in the oven. I substituted the southern self-rising flour with 2/3 c Wondra (as suggested) and 1 1/3 c AP flour (not suggested) with 1.5 tsp baking powder and a total of 1 tsp salt. So that&#039;s what NOT to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All substituting aside, I also found them WAY too sweet. They were, as another poster said above, like cake. Or muffins. Or pancakes. (But not biscuits!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#039;m going to try again, with the AP flour and Wondra... only up the salt to 1.5 tsp, the BP to 2 tsp, and decrease the sugar to a tablespoon. And if that doesn&#039;t work I am going to mail-order White Lily :-) (and still cut the sugar!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the recipe though!]]></description>
