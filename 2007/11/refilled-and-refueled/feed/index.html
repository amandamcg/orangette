					<description><![CDATA[I just finished making, eating, and putting up the dishes from this meal, ahh I just remembered that I forgot the cream. Oh well, it was good anyway but in trying to incorporate more vegetables into my diet I used spaghetti squash instead of pasta. Kudos. I love the blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I discovered a recipe in the mid-80s in a vegetarian cookbook for sauteed finely sliced sprouts with mushrooms.  I&#039;ve been making it for years and converted lots of folks to that old staple vegetable.  I&#039;ve never added pine nuts, but have upgraded it with portobello mushrooms and as always lots of garlic.  I used to serve it as a side dish, but when I tried the leftovers on pasta - culinary delight!  And now I&#039;m old enough to afford the best reggiano, it&#039;s even better.&lt;/&gt;I love this blog and will now have to buy Bon Appetit. Congratulations  - they are lucky to have you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this last night with some brussels sprouts for out weekly CSA box delivery, grown just outside of Seattle-- wow, it was so delicious.  We made one modification:  sautÃ©d some baby leeks and garlic. Next time, I plan to use fresh pasta.  Its definitely a keeper.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[we tried your Brussel Sprout recipe, but tinkered a bit, using mushrooms instead of pine nuts, and sour cream instead of plain cream.  The mushrooms were lovely; the sour cream perhaps not liquidy enough, despite our adding cooking water.  Thanks, though!  We had your Celeriac soup tonight, and it&#039;s a keeper.]]></description>
