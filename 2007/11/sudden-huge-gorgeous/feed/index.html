					<description><![CDATA[I just have to tell you that over this holiday, I made my usual fare, and then used 2 of your recipes to wow the crowd. And wow them isn&#039;t even the tip of the iceberg. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I had to make the Cranberry Chutney a day ahead because I just couldn&#039;t stand it anymore, and I&#039;m glad I did. I&#039;m having on toast with goat cheese for breakfast. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The roasted pears impressed everyone, especially when served warm and spooned over vanilla frozen yogurt. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks for the recipes. You are a constant source of inspiration.]]></description>
