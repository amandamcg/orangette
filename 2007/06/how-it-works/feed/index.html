					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been bemoaning the loss of Burritoville&#039;s salsas for over a decade now and just thought to google recipes and stumbled across your decade-old post. Any chance Brandon ever tried his hand at the green salsa recipe?? Regardless, gonna try to make this tonight!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I forgot how good charred salsas are! No grill handy, so I made this in a cast iron skillet on the stove yesterday and am in love. I woke up this morning thinking of Brandon and feeling guilty for having chips and salsa for breakfast. Delicious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looks delicious. I like adding a bit of cocoa to my salsa and a healthy dose of ancho. The smokiness lends depth and cocoa adds an element that no one can ever identify but they keep trying because it makes it so tasty.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I whipped up the recipe today; it took me like 30 minutes in all, with about &lt;10 minutes of actual prep/assembly time. DELICIOUS and PERFECT! I never knew how simple it would be, funnily enough. And for £1.90 for the ingredients, with a yield of 0.6 litres, I am hella chuffed! Thank you Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, yes, the fiery green salsa!  I still make that one, based (loosely) on Brandon&#039;s instructions in the comments of the original post.  It&#039;s very like a Peruvian salsa that is served with Aji de Gallina, so I use it for that, too!]]></description>
