					<description><![CDATA[There will &lt;&gt;always&lt;&gt; be a cup of coffee here for you.  I am enamored of hot drinks, and I think it&#039;s because of a passage in &lt;&gt;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&lt;&gt; -- I think I mentioned that once upon a time in some comment here.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m afraid I ate the whole torte my own damn self, minus the one wedge Ali had the first night -- had the last bit while driving to market early yesterday morning, and only dropped jammy apricot on myself twice.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;But no fear.  I&#039;m about to tackle an orange and chocolate version of your yogurt cake, and if you can get here in time for tomorrow&#039;s potluck...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, this blog is such a wonderful resource - you know that, yes?  Take me, right now, for example, with an enormous bowl of apricots on the counter from yesterday&#039;s morning market, a free-ish afternoon because it&#039;s a holiday, and a strong desire to do something unrelated to farming.  I come here ... et voila!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;ll report back.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this cake with some pluots. It was perfect. The pluots were a little tart, which made a nice contrast with the rich cake. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I think I&#039;m going to try making this with cherries next.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hate to be a downer, but this recipe didn&#039;t work for me. While baking, about a 1/2 cup of butter oozed out of the springform pan (fewer calories!)onto the floor of the oven and started burning and smoking up the house. Then the cake still stuck to the parchment paper. Haven&#039;t tasted it yet, but I think I did something wrong.]]></description>
