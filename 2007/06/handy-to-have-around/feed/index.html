					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I must thank you again for an excellent recipe. I made these on Wednesday, using ordinary small onions (shallots are prohibitingly expensive here and hard to find anyway). 500 grams of onions (halved or quartered) for your amounts of oil and sherry vinegar, and you know what, they were absolutely delicious. K. was especially keen on them:) And they&#039;re lovely cold, too - I had some on toasted and buttered rye bread this morning for breakfast:)&lt;/&gt;So, THANK YOU! You&#039;re a star!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I also have to admit a shameful tendency of letting foods age past their prime while in my care. Shallots are a paticular problem, but hopefully with this recipe,  they&#039;ll be put to better use!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;oliver&lt;/&gt;www.chocolateshavings.ca]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m addicted to shallots. Sometimes I fry up a whole bunch (either leave it to a nice soft caramelized state or fry them to a crisp depending on what I&#039;ll be adding them to) and add it to anything and everything I&#039;m eating. Brandon&#039;s way is genius! I&#039;ve never baked them with olive oil and vinegar before.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Imbricated, huh? I like that, Monkey Wrangler.   &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;They &lt;&gt;are&lt;&gt; pretty wonderful, Pink!  Hope you enjoy them.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Yup, State of New Jersey, I certainly did. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nosheteria, I had a good chuckle at your comment!  Fortunately, I&#039;m pretty sure that we ate all the shallots.  Next time we&#039;re in Oklahoma, though, I&#039;ll keep an eye out for them...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oh, thank you, Mercedes!  You&#039;re wonderful.  Eeeep!  Thank you!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Good luck with your new site, Candy!  I wish you all the best.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Does this restaurant serve the shallots alongside something else, Planethalder, or alone, as a dish in and of themselves?  I&#039;d love to know how what else they might pair them with...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks, Joey!  We&#039;ll see what we can do...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You&#039;re most certainly welcome, Erika.  My pleasure!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Michelle, it really &lt;&gt;is&lt;&gt; some sort of monsoon season, isn&#039;t it?  I was talking with my mom yesterday, and she said it was raining AGAIN.  Geez.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks, Buffy!  Here&#039;s to the Fridge-Nazi Brigade. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Dave, I love the way you and your wife chose to do your wedding.  That&#039;s so lovely and romantic - and MUCH easier, I imagine.  Brandon and I want our wedding to be a big party with all our family and friends, but as it turns out, that adds up to a &lt;&gt;lot&lt;&gt; of people.  Eeek.  A lot of work, too, but so very worth it!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Good luck with your wedding planning, Miss13!  Very exciting.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I hope you enjoyed them, jennbecluv!  And as for cooking in my wedding dress, you know, I just might have to try it - &lt;&gt;after&lt;&gt; July 29, of course. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I love it, Stephanie.  Fossilized spices?!  Hilarious.  (Unless, of course, you have to cook with them, which is not so funny.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hilarious... I can&#039;t believe all these crazy mothers! Mine is just the same. And you should see her pantry!  It&#039;s impossible to cook at her place ... you see the spices are all there, then you go to use them and realise they&#039;re fossilized!&lt;/&gt;I think with her, it&#039;s a combination of obssessive compulsive behaviour, obsessive hording, and frugality â€” when I try and throw something out she&#039;ll say something like &#039;you didn&#039;t grow up during the depression!&quot;... Neither did she, but it doesn&#039;t stop her fighting me when I try and discard ancient foodstuffs. But maybe there&#039;s a grain of truth there. Maybe our generation has had it too easy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;m just going to have to make a quick alteration to the recipe I was planning to make tonight just for these shallots.  I think they will make a great complement to carmalized onions.  Thanks for the idea!  As for taking it easy on the blogging these days, I think it&#039;s entirely justified.  Afterall, one can&#039;t cook in a wedding dress!  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Sorry, off topic.  I just saw your foodtv vid.  Sooo cool!  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Good luck on the wedding.  My wife and I just did our vows together and invited a million friends over for a party and when they got to the party, we told them we got married.  Very stressless.  Each their own.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Best,&lt;/&gt;Dave]]></description>
