					<description><![CDATA[Favorite banana bread recipe! Thank you Molly! I was out of regular sugar, so I subbed in that. I also...totally forgot to add the eggs. DOH. But I think the bananas did some of the job that eggs usually do in quickbreads...the consistency was moise, dense, and still a little fluffy. Need it this week, post-election horror :-(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first discovered this recipe two years ago and loved it so much I went on to make it as a host gift for all of my visits that summer. I came back to it today when I needed to do something with old bananas - in Khujand, Tajikistan.  I wanted to let you know that the recipe has traveled all the way to Central Asia, and is just as good here as in the U.S. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations on the baby!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made this for the first time; why did I wait so long? It&#039;s so, so delicious. Having a piece at my desk right now is making this Friday extra happy. I&#039;m already plotting making a second batch over the weekend. Thanks for putting your writing and recipes out into the world for us to enjoy, and congrats on your newest addition! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This recipe was wonderful, considering I made a spontaneous decision in the midst of the grading and comment writing last night--and discovered I was short a banana fruit....so I added blueberries in place of the &#039;naner and the consumers were in still in favor! Thanks for this! My first hand at banana bread and I&#039;m hooked!]]></description>
