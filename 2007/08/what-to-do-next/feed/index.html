					<description><![CDATA[About Polenta fries! When I was a kid we had &quot;corn meal mush&quot; for breakfast on cold mornings. My mom always cooked extra for chilling and frying the next day.  We ate it with syrup (if available.  During WW11 we never knew for sure what would be available..jelly, honey, syrup or a homemade syrup my mom made with brown sugar and water, or syrup made with the remnants in several jelly jars mixed with some water and boiled down).

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly! I just serendipitously met Mara tonight on the bus on the way to dinner at the Gourmet Institute, and she reminded me that you&#039;d been to her farm on your honeymoon, so of course I had to come back and read this again.  She is really great, and the place looks wonderful - I really hope to go sometime. We basically eloped on Whidbey Island, the few days we spent up there were wonderfully relaxed, much like your trip!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a part-time resident in Cowichan Bay I can attest to ALL the amazing facts! The jelly bean is to stop drips from the bottom of the cone bye the way... &lt;/&gt;So glad you enjoyed the Cowichan Valley. I did for 3 weeks this summer and leave a pc. of my heart there everytime I visit. Next time make a run into Duncan ( 8 min. from Cow Bay) and what appears to be  small town with Walmart,gas stations etc actually has a downtown with some amazing specialty shops where you can spend an afternoon. Not to be mised are the local wineries and vinyards, our favs being Blue Grousse, Cherry Point ( oh the Ortega, a wonderful white)and Godfrey-Brownell( a red named &quot;The Scarlatti Sisters&quot; is memorable)....the list has over 10 within 10 minutes of anywhere! We made a birthday appointment at Venturie-Schultze and yes, their balsamic is stellar, almost as fine as one tasted in Reggio-Emilia last year! Their wines are first class and their  sparkling varieties are amazing for summer dining!&lt;/&gt;As you can see I could go on and on. Better yet, come out and see for yourself. The Cowichan Valley has been dubbed &quot;the new Provence&quot; and I can see why...did I forget to mention the lavender farm, the saskatoon berry farm and the glass blowers?.....&lt;/&gt;Congrats on the big step into marriage. I made the step 31 years ago and it is amazing. You need to return for your first anniversary!&lt;/&gt;Ciao!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been waiting for some time to read up on all the details of your wedding, and couldn&#039;t believe my eyes when I scanned through the pictures and recognized the shots from the Boathouse.  My husband and I honeymooned there in late September 2000, and it was so tranquil and perfect after the madness of the festivities.  We were lucky enough to stay several nights, and enjoyed glasses of wine on the dock in the evenings, watching the seals at play.  We boated to Butchart Gardens one day, and boated to dinner at the same place I&#039;m sure you visited.  We ate outdoors, under the heaters, and I don&#039;t remember the food at all, but I do remember the setting...the whole visit was fantastic. Thanks for your recount of it.]]></description>
