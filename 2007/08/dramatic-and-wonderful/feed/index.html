					<description><![CDATA[Hi - my name&#039;s Jessica and I too am de-lurking for the first time.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Many happy returns...really. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The tomato sauce recipie is one of the all time best, most reliable, totally satisfing, gratifyingly effortless and completly perfect recipies known to man or woman. How fitting that you have chosen to preface such a charming post with one the top five stand-alone recipies of all time, and, in case you hadn&#039;t guessed, a personal favorite.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Also loved reading about your friend the baby water-buffalo who&#039;s tounge is the colour of dried lavender...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;May you always protect eachothers privacy.&lt;/&gt;May your innocence be fullfilled.&lt;/&gt;And may your love find its living image - a child - who will grow up sheltered and cradled in the harmonious spaces between the two of you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congrats to you both!  It looks like an amazing and delicious event.  I am a new reader to your blog and have been working my way through many of your recipes during my daughter&#039;s naps.  Before she came along my husband and I took a similar trip to your honeymoon and stayed at Fairburn Farms.  It sounds like they have hired a chef and are catering to a more &quot;foodie&quot; crowd....but I must say that it sounds amazing.  Those water buffalo are pretty incredible!  Anyway - Best to you and your new partner in life and food!]]></description>
