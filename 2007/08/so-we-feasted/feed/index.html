					<description><![CDATA[Hi there, I just recently was assigned to do a project on your blog for my journalism class, and let me tell you - I am SO EXCITED! I love food blogs, and yours is amazing.  I&#039;ve only gotten to this post in my &quot;research&quot; so far, and I love it.  And, actually, I go to university at the University of Victoria, and it is very nice to see that you love British Columbia (or, should i say, our beer?)  I can&#039;t wait to get to the rest of your blog entries, and you really are quite an inspiration to bloggers! Thanks for being so lively and captivating!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly...it is wonderful reading about your wedding &amp; Ciao Thyme. We are now on the beginning of summer 2009 and I thoroughly enjoyed meeting you last night up here in Bellingham at Ciao Thyme. The corn cakes with bacon/tomato, the meatballs &amp; the french lemon yogurt cake all were delicious. As I told you when meeting you, your sharing about your Dad touched my heart down to my soul as it was as if I was hearing about my Father who passed away in 2003 in his early 70&#039;s and loved cooking, traveling the world &amp; food/wine. This Bellingham gal thanks you &amp; your hubby, Brandon, for sharing of your life &amp; passion for food.&lt;br /&gt;In peace~~~Ann]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Jessica!  I loved the look of the cakes too.  As for the stands, I wish I could tell you where they came from, but they weren&#039;t mine.  They belonged to our caterer.  So sorry about that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a new comer to your site, and my first read was the day prior to  your wedding, reading about pickles and stress.  I didn&#039;t revisit your site until this weekend, which I have spent catching up, kind of like when you&#039;re sick, and they are showing a marathon of Project Runway.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anyway, I, myself am a newly wed (two months now) and so enjoyed reading the details of your day.  But your final paragraph summed it all up so nicely.  I remember the moment when we were able to sit down to enjoy dinner, and sitting at the head of the room, I was able to take in everything; the lighting, the bundles of sunflowers streamed everywhere, the music and all our friends and family surrounding us.  I never felt so relieved in my life.  It was a success; the planning was worth it all.  But it was also all done, and now, we were going to be able to continue on with our life together...and I was so excited.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you for your note, and reminding me of that moment.  Good luck and congratulations!  You sound like a match made in heaven!]]></description>
