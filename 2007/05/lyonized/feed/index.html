					<description><![CDATA[Dear Orangette lady, I&#039;m new to this blog and late at this post, but Oh! Lyon - I had to write you a comment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Lyon on holiday while I was living horrible few months (at least food wise and weather wise) in Germany (after a stay in Paris, to make matters worse, only the loveliest city in the world). It saved me. Baguette with jamon saved me after a cold wintery baguette-starved German stay. But only till I discovered all the lovely innards they stuff into saucissons (Lyonnaise food is not for the weak hearted), and the delicious raviole, and oh the soups and oh the mousse...Lyon is food heaven and its amazing how it or France, or even Europe itself maintains its old ways, its dignity in its Bouchons, proudly the same since forever. &lt;br /&gt; The sun and the food and the sales in Lyon did me in. How I loved it, and this post makes me wistful. The memories make me say &#039;oh&#039; a whole lot for sure!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, this is my first time on your blog and I am really impressed. i am sure you&#039;ve heard that before. next time you are in lyon i would suggest a restaurant called Oxalis. It isn&#039;t a bouchon but it should be on the lyon resto map. the owner is obsessed with sardines and oxalis. i am a food photographer and have worked with her before. anyways, nice job!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am planning a trip soon and noting down every wonderful recommendation. Beautifully written and you capture the place perfectly. Don&#039;t rule out a career in travel writing when you&#039;re done with that recipe book!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yum. I&#039;m trying to move back towards simpler foods and seeing that plate of charcoutrie, cornichons, lentils, and salad really hit the spot. I wish we in the US could embrace this fare.  While I&#039;ve never been to a bouchon (and I was in Lyon a few times), I loved going to &quot;auberges&quot; when I lived in Alsace. There was one in the Vosges mountains that made me feel like Heidi.&lt;/&gt;Cheers - Rosemarie]]></description>
