					<description><![CDATA[Molly - I returned to Paris for the first time in 10 years, and it was the first time visit for my partner, Eric. It was all things familiar and welcoming as I had hoped. Paris does not seem to change (externally, that is - shops come and go, but the buildings and Seine stay), and this is probably one of the reasons why Paris is so loved and easy to return to. A lovely blog entry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;/&gt;I never experienced Paris like you did, perhaps because I already had a first and second home at my grandmother&#039;s house in a teensy-tiny little Belgian village.  But I think I would like to try.  Paris does have something.  &lt;/&gt;May I ask where you stayed during your visit?  I noticed that your picnic had plates - does that mean you were staying in an appartment rather than a hotel?  I&#039;m curious, because hotels are always my least favorite part of the travel experience.&lt;/&gt;C]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mon dieu, are you a kindred spirit: I ran away to Paris after highschool, worked in a beautiful bistro on rue de Seine, had the strangest and most honest affair with an older man, developed a lifetime attachment to the G&amp;T and the Negroni, and felt like I&#039;d finally come home.  I went back to study during college and there was that same sense of return.  Now, I&#039;m living in Martinique, having confused my love of Paris for a love of all things francophone, and while I can&#039;t complain (that would be obscene) the city of all cities still holds my heart.  I.e.: je comprends.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you for your beautiful writing, images, recipes and this particularly evocative post.]]></description>
