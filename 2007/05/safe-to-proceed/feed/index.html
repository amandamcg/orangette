					<description><![CDATA[I have made this ice cream now about a dozen times and I can safely say I think I have an improvement. Well, I am in no position to say that I improve on anything David creates so, let me say, a variation. The first half dozen times I made this, it was strongly &quot;eggy&quot; and not so &quot;minty.&quot; Maybe stateside we don&#039;t have such glorious and bright mint as what is available in Paris (this goes for pretty much everything) but my mint wasn&#039;t doing the job of overpowering the weird, heavy custard-y egg flavor. It was like my tongue was desperately hunting for the mint underneath. Also, why so many pots and bowls and cooling this and reserving that? I am sure there are very good reasons why, but they are not obvious to me. So, my variation: 1. Put all the cream,  milk, sugar and salt and mint in the pot. Steam rises, turn off, steep for one hour. 2. Strain mint leaves 3. Cool mixture. Mix in ice cream machine. What results is a little lighter and fluffier but lacks the heavy, egg custard notes. Still, with all the admiration in the world for David and everyone else whose mint won out in this recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[took me a year to get to it, but i finally made this ice cream.  wow.  soo bright and minty, so very rich, really satisfying.  mine had the slightest pale green tinge to it, and it was beautiful.  I&#039;m so happy to finally have such a lovely conclusion to the search for chip-less mint ice cream!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Me again!  I&#039;ve been happily churning since my ice cream maker and David&#039;s book arrived...and yesterday the mint at the farmer&#039;s market was calling to me, so I made this recipe out of David&#039;s book.  I swirled in some cocoa nibs at the very end though.  And it is soooo good.  The Boyfriend keeps sneaking to the freezer, and I&#039;ll have to make more before the week&#039;s out I think.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hilda, I&#039;m &lt;&gt;so&lt;&gt; sorry for not getting back to you sooner.  My apologies!  How did your ice cream turn out?  I can&#039;t imagine that the extra cream could have messed it up too terribly.  Maybe just changed the texture a bit?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Congratulations, Kara, on your upcoming wedding!  36 days - wow, that&#039;s coming up quickly.  Eek!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I love it, Vanessa B.  Congratulations!  That sounds like just the kind of wedding day I want to have.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Amy, BUY IT!  You won&#039;t be sorry...]]></description>
