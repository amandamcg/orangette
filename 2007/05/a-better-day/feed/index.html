					<description><![CDATA[sigh... i&#039;m late to this but i think that this may very well make this hot, sticky early july seem a little lovelier as well.  loving the beauty of the composed salad, so elegant on the plate.  and there are still plump sweet melons to be had.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, all!  So sorry to have not been able to keep up with your comments.  The past couple of weeks have been busy, wedding-wise, and I have a feeling that it&#039;s only just beginning!  Oof.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;At any rate, just a few words.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Kirsten, you &lt;&gt;do&lt;&gt; know exactly which night I mean!  Ugh.  After such a nice time, it was such an awful, awful cab ride!  Not fair.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Michelle, I might well run into you in OKC!  Brandon and I are headed there next week, for some pre-wedding festivities...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anne, I worry that I may be &lt;&gt;way&lt;&gt; too late in replying to your comment, but yes, you can definitely make Jimmy&#039;s quiche in a standard-size tarte or quiche or pie pan.  It&#039;ll take longer to bake, but just keep your eye on it.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Aw, thank you, Rose!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;So glad to hear it, wellunderstood!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oh Jes, I am WAY too late, no doubt, to help you, and I&#039;m so sorry.  But for future reference, I would suggest Cafe Flora or Carmelita.  Both are vegetarian restaurants, and I know that Cafe Flora, for one, is especially good with food restrictions.  Hope you come back to Seattle soon!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Katie, I love the idea of that lemon basil.  Yum.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[re: Portland Farmer&#039;s Market -- it is seriously getting incredible, it&#039;s so exciting!  I bought some hood strawberries Saturday, that looked a bit iffy and they were amazing, but we have already had strawberries (they&#039;ve been growing them in greenhouses) for almost a month that have been pretty darn good.  We&#039;re so, so lucky here.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Btw,  I made this salad last week, and it was delicious, simple, and a perfect quick weeknight meal.  I found some fabulous lemon basil at the store that I sprinkled on top instead of parsley, it really brightened it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Loving your photography style... I know you are writer extraordinaire... it is as if your words float into ones brain and bring a smile with them.  But, I have been quite captivated by your pics too.  Thanks for all your good work and inspiration!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[made this for dinner last night, a humid and rainy early summer evening . . . with a glass of white wine we were in heaven!  i drizzled a bit of the wine over the melon, too.  this will certainly be a featured menu for our summertime enjoyment!  yum!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nicely written post. Thanks, I needed it - I just came in from a rainstorm of the sort where I had to hang my clothes up upon entering the house and they&#039;re creating a puddle beneath them. May indeed. I&#039;m looking forward to melon season and more reasonable summer weather.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree with you more, this spring has just been one day of wacky weather after another.  Temperature changes of 20+ degrees in two days is ridiculous.  But I love summer in Seattle and I&#039;m really looking forward to June.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Carless is Seattle is not so bad. Sprawl in this part of country is nothing compared to anywhere in the Midwest. We&#039;ve adjusted to packing more travel-friendly items to bring to gatherings. Unfortunately, my shoe collection has become much more utilitarian; but being carless has relieved much unnecessary stress in our lives. Carrying our cat to the vet in the rain in a carboard carrier has been a challenge. Yes, the rain sucks, but so does traffic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oooh! That is so fresh and yummy. I can just smell the cantaloupe from here. :) It&#039;s peach season right now in Texas and those taste lovely in salads as well with blue cheese and pecans...]]></description>
