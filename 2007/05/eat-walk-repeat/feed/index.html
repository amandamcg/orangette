					<description><![CDATA[Your post was such a gift! I&#039;d eyed and dismissed &lt;&gt; nefles &lt;&gt; since I arrived in Paris, sharing your aversion to the bruised, but after reading what you had to say I promptly bought a punnet and devoured the rather baffling fruit according to your helpful instructions. Many thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My apologies, Alex, for taking so long to reply!  I&#039;ve got my fingers crossed that you&#039;ll stop back by and see this.  To answer your questions, well, I&#039;ve done several different things on my stays in Paris.  The first time was as a student, from 1999 to 2000.  I lived with a host family and was there for about six months.  When I finished college in 2001, I went back there again, this time to work.  &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.ciep.fr/en/assistantetr/index.htm&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This&lt;&gt; is what my job was.  It doesn&#039;t pay much, but if you can afford to do it, it&#039;s really a pretty sweet gig.  I was assigned to a high school in Saint Cloud, a small town to the west of Paris, not terribly far from Versailles, but I lived in Paris proper, in the 11th arrondissement.  I rented a furnished studio apartment, which wasn&#039;t cheap, but I made do.  I found it through a company called &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.lodgis.com/en/&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lodgis&lt;&gt;. I was there for about 10 months that time, and because I was technically an employee of the Ministry of Education, I had a carte de sejour and health insurance and was &quot;legal.&quot;  I went back in 2004 to do research, and then this year for pleasure.  Let me know if you have any more questions.  Happy to help!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nat, you&#039;re killing me!  A loquat straight from the tree, and still warm from the sun?!  I WANT ONE.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[GAAH! Loquats!&lt;/&gt;Growing up, there were a couple of loquat trees in our garden, I love them. I spent many summer days eating those things straight off the tree, still warm from the sun. They don&#039;t last more than about half a day off the tree, they go grainy and dry.&lt;/&gt;Now I&#039;ll just have to go travelling in France again to relive my childhood memories!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always heard about loquats, growing up (from my grandmother, and it always seemed such a farcical name), but never had the pleasure of eating them.  Seems I&#039;ll have to remedy that as soon as possible!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Molly, I&#039;m a newish reader (a few months now), but I&#039;ve never commented before.  I had to break the drought to ask you:  You&#039;ve mentioned the times when you lived in Paris, but what did you do when you were there?  Did you work?  How did you find a place to live?  I have an EU passport, so that part&#039;s easy at least, I think!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I travelled to France two years ago for the first time since I was a little kid, and I fell back in love with the place.  I speak some French, enough to get around okay when I was there last, but I&#039;m not fluent.  No one else I know has moved to Europe, so I&#039;m turning to you.  Help?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Guys, I&#039;m a disaster at keeping up with comments these days.  Please bear with me!  Replying to you never seems to happen as quickly as I wish it did.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Swanner, I am &lt;&gt;so&lt;&gt; jealous.  A loquat tree in every yard?  If I didn&#039;t like Seattle so much, I&#039;d be very, very tempted to hop the first flight to Florida...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anonymous, you have them in Davis?!  I&#039;m headed to the Bay Area for a quick visit next month, and I&#039;m going to be prowling the place for loquats...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;My pleasure, Alice Q.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Aw, Leah, thank you!  You&#039;re dreamy.  xo&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Lisa S., can you find loquats easily in SF?  I&#039;m salivating at the thought...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Sarah, I&#039;m so glad I posted this too!  I hope it leads you to some memorable meals.  Have a great trip.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks, Lizzy!  I hope so too.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Shira, you live around the corner from Bistrot Paul Bert?  I&#039;m &lt;&gt;so&lt;&gt; jealous.  Grrr.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;One dollar each, Anjali?!  That&#039;s crazy.  I&#039;d be saving up, if I were you...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Allison, if Paris is any indication, I&#039;m &lt;&gt;sure&lt;&gt; they&#039;d remember you in Italy.  I was stunned by how little things had changed at some of my favorite spots.  I say you find a way to go back there soon, though, and see for yourself.  Don&#039;t you think?  Maybe a solo trip?  Or a quick getaway for you and your husband, sans kids?  Hop to it...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Yep, Kayenne, I am familiar with Sadaharu Aoki, although I must admit that I haven&#039;t tasted any of his pastries.  I did ogle them through the pastry case at Lafayette Gourmet, though...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Mercedes, it&#039;s &lt;&gt;definitely&lt;&gt; time to remedy that!  Definitely.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Yes, Hannah.  Must. Go!  And when you do, I&#039;m coming with you.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oh, Knit_tgz, I love the thought of all those loquat trees, just waiting to be picked!  &lt;&gt;Sigh&lt;&gt;.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You&#039;re welcome, Anonymous.  It&#039;s my pleasure.  Have a great visit.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks, Christine!  I loved writing this post.  So much fun to relive all those moments and meals...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Have a wonderful trip, Marvin!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I like that, Amisha!  &quot;Absorbing culture in a different way&quot; - like, um, ah, through my digestive tract?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You and Sebastian had the right idea, Sarah.  How fun to know that you two were there!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;V Smoothe, I&#039;ll see what I can do...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Max, that picture is so cute!  Love it.  But as for the palmiers, you&#039;re going to hate me.  I didn&#039;t have one.  I &lt;&gt;do&lt;&gt; love them, but I was distracted by the chaussons aux pommes and croissants and tartes and so on!  You know?  Ack.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Mais bien sur, Caterine!  Je parle francais.  Vas-y!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Bipolarlawyercook, you&#039;ll have to wait for the next post, when I write about blood sausage.  Best food memory of the whole trip!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks, Sui Mai!  Hope you had a good morning at the Bastille Market today...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Go, dc365!  Goooo!  Do it!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oh Ales, what I wouldn&#039;t do for some loquat chutney!  That sounds so, so good.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;David, I think I know just the word you have in mind.  Does it start with a &quot;b,&quot; perhaps?  Hmm?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Maija, that sounds like my kind of night!  Wow.  Makes me want to go to NYC right this minute.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I hope you get to Paris soon, Deborah!  In the meantime, go get yourself some radishes.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Aleza, I wish someone on my block had a loquat tree!  Although we &lt;&gt;do&lt;&gt; have lots of blackberry bushes around here, which I suppose are good in their own right...]]></description>
