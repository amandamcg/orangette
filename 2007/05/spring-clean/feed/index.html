					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, just wanted to say that I&#039;ve made this a few times now and I love it more and more each time I do. I went on a trip to Lyon almost exactly a year ago now and it reminds me not only of that trip, but as you kind of talked about in your post, a better way to eat in general... thanks so much for sharing!]]></description>
