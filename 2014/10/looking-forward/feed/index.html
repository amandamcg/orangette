					<description><![CDATA[Beautiful, shots!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the link to the Bitman article. He had some interesting pointers. I found some more detailed advice in the book &quot;French Children Don&#039;t Throw Food.&quot; The book is entertaining and I found I picked up some good advice about how to deal with kids and food through the entertaining anecdotes. &lt;br /&gt;Feeding kids well is a subject very true to my heart. Here is a little piece on how we feed our kids, if anyone is interested. https://herenowpage.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=925&amp;action=edit&lt;br /&gt;Bon Appétit!&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>
