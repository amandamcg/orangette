					<description><![CDATA[Steam or wet sterilization is superior to dry.  Steam has more energy.  But pathogenic bacteria are not likely to grow in a strong sugared jam.

Regardless of whether the jars are treated in wet or dry heat, the lids should be in hot water before use.  This is not for sterilization, but to soften the glue.  Place the lids in water, boil and leave them until you&#039;re ready to use.

One more thing about sugar.  We are all using Italian plums that vary in the amount of sugar they have.  The season, date picked, genetics of the tree, location, and weather means that each of us starts with fruit that varies as to the sugar in the fruit itself.  That is part of the reason for different amounts of sugar added.  Take the sugar added with a grain of ......errr.  As they say, your mileage may vary.  

But the amount of sugar in the final batch is part of what protect it against dangerous bacteria.  One shouldn&#039;t need a pressure cooker as the amount of sugar, the acidity and heat are enough to prevent pathogenic bacteria.  

If you are not an experienced canner, make small batches and store in the refrigerator or freezer.  The more levels of security make it safer including using it quickly, preparing in small amounts, keeping it at 212 F from start to finish, using sterile jars/lids/tools, and checking your vacuum.

High acid, high sugar, and high salted foods are less likely to become contaminated with dangerous bacteria.  For all OTHER foods, you must use a pressure canner or other methods such as dehydration/freezing.

					<description><![CDATA[My mother told me how her mother made strawberry jam with nothing but strawberries. She just put them in the sun, under something(glass?cloth?) When they dried to her liking, she water bath canned the jam.  Mom said it was the best jam she ever had.  Mom would be 100, came from a farm family(12 kids) and they were poor.  Finnish people on a farm in Lafayette, Oregon.   Wish I knew what my mom knew, and grandma too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am one of those man jam makers from Paw Paw, Mango, PassionfruitLemon Curd and Plum. The berry jams are so easy to make. The Curds are are more challenging and only have a short life so it is necessary to only make small lots or you need to have a lot of friends.
Plum jam, great, take an almost uneatable fuit and turn it into a great jam, I use the 2/1 with reusable vacuums lids. At a jam factory in Victoria where they jar jam for many different brands they use the heat of the jam to serialize the jars and lids, I still steralise by boiling water, but the oven idea sounds good also I use the saucer test. Have to thank my Mum a great Cook used the it looks right method, no measuring of any sort no recipe just a great feel for what is right, now cooking for people on the other side. My Grand mother on fathers side was even better she could Cook or make anything from frozen to hard boiled sweets to almost anything, wish I had taken more notice of her recipe for the hard boiled lollies. It&#039;s all supposed to be fun can&#039;t stand the drama on reality TV.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://orangette.net/2014/10/the-satisfaction/#comment-42397&quot;&gt;Marie Z.&lt;/a&gt;.

Marie thank you for this.  I actually used the 2 to 1 plums/sugar ration and found it far to sweet...I will be taking that batch out of the jars and add another batch of cooked plums to it without the sugar so all is not lost.
I realize most people prefer the sugary but when it exceeds the flavor of the fruit it&#039;s just a no go for me... sorry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aren&#039;t Italian plums delightful? The home we are staying in has a couple of old trees in the yard. We had our best year yet for plums and harvested thirty-six pounds.  After eating a bunch (of course!), we ended up making jam, chutney, barbecue sauce and spiced pickled plums. The jam is wonderful (the color!), but I&#039;m especially pleased with that last one. 

We also have a quince tree and make Paradise Jelly, an old American traditional of quince, apples and cranberries, with a flavor all its own. We&#039;ve made it three times now and each time it&#039;s a different, rich shade of pink. The tree only produces a good crop alternating years, unfortunately.

I just found your blog. Very, very nice. I look forward to getting to know and enjoy it.
