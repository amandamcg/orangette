					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve often been surprised at how many food bloggers confess to days, even weeks of not actually cooking.  I cook every day for my family, and, growing up, a freshly cooked, balanced meal was non-negotiable in our culture.  Because it has been drilled into me from a young age, I don&#039;t consider it a burden.  Perhaps I should start my own blog?  If only I had the photography and technical skills!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this soup as the starter for our Thanksgiving dinner. Delish! I sprinkled pomegranate seeds on top (instead of the lime) and loved the burst of flavor they brought to each bite. Thank you for this recipe. Definitely one I will make again and share.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more with the idea that home cooking doesnt need a recipe or a production. Youre home and cooking, right? so I personally count that as a win.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hello&lt;br /&gt;it&#039;s a shame when a hobby became a commitment. Of course, you cook special dishes, if a diet of your child requires it, but this kind of cooking does not make fun anymore. Can you at least pre-cook, or have you cook fresh every day?&lt;br /&gt;regards&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you. I needed to hear this so much. I love to cook but am right there with you in terms of serving a lot of simple things to get by day to day. My son has complicated dietary needs that mean I have to cook more than I would if I could take even more short cuts and I was feeling kind of down and overwhelmed about it tonight and your words helped :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good for you Molly!  You are as real as they come and always a joy to read/share with.  You have your priorities in line ... and I&#039;m proud to say I&#039;m with you!  I love to cook too, and when I have the opportunity will create something lovely.  AND, during the workweek, we have some prescribed, easy to pull together, healthy and locally sourced meals that give us leftovers for lunch, etc.  &lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hello, &lt;br /&gt;I think you are absolutely right. People put their standards too high and think, that they should do more cooking. But it&#039;s ok not to cook every day. Who has the time to cook for hours every day? In addition to the job and the family should we be allowed to rest in the evening, shouldnÂ´t we? Am I right?&lt;br /&gt;regards&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Made this with 1 can of coconut milk &amp; vegetable stock from a box. Delicious. I went with the 1 TB sriracha amount. Cannot imagine putting more coconut milk in; would be gross.&lt;br /&gt;I also put the onions in with the melting butter to try to get a little carmelization before adding carrots to the fully melted butter.]]></description>
