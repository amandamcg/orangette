					<description><![CDATA[I just remembered: some kids dig finding a gummy worm in their popsicles. I usually put one in apple popsicles, so that it&#039;s like an apple with a worm in it, but wouldn&#039;t it be equally fun (and appropriate) to put a gummy worm in the mold for a fudgesicle? It&#039;d be like a worm in the (delicious, chocolaty) dirt! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used all Ghirardelli. Milk chocolate and 60% bittersweet chocolate baking bar- maybe this is the reason? Doesn&#039;t baking bar have some weird property? Like needing to be tempered in some situation? I don&#039;t know the science of it at all but I think I heard somewhere there&#039;s difference between bars and the chips... Maybe I shouldI have used chips I wonder... &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is very interesting. Also it is comforting to know that it is actually supposed to very smooth! I should make it again maybe with chips next time. I  thought it was so weird how grainy it was and thought this couldn&#039;t possibly be the thing! I&#039;ll keep you posted.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Suzi!  That&#039;s so weird - and maddening! I&#039;ve made the recipe three times, and mine have never turned out grainy; they&#039;re actually really smooth. What brands of cocoa and chocolate did you use?]]></description>
