					<description><![CDATA[Just made it tonight and now I wish I bought two heads.&lt;br /&gt;We have an electric range and it took a little linger, but it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had put more garlic in. 7 cloves were not enough.&lt;br /&gt;The grated cheese is a great touch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is SO good as is...BUT! I was reading the article about middle eastern food last week in the NYT so I decided to play with it only a little bit. I added two tbsp of za&#039;atar before roasting.  Then, when it was done, I tossed the whole thing with a cup of cooked red quinoa and threw in the finely grated zest of a lemon. In a little bowl on the side I made a yogurt tahini sauce with garlic, a little lemon and water. It was so likeable even my pickiest kid liked it. Although he isn&#039;t really THAT picky. Also, the colors were gorgeous.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Helen in CA, roasting the garlic in the &quot;shell&quot; keeps it moist, so that when it&#039;s done roasting, the clove is soft and spreadable.  Some servings will get unpeeled cloves, yes, but it&#039;s easy to discard the papery shell, and then you can eat the tender inside.]]></description>
