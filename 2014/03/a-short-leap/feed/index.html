					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been taking these out of the freezer by the dozen, thawing them a bit, then letting them bathe in a simple tomato-onion-garlic sauce (a la Wednesday Chef: &quot;Meatballs for New Mothers&quot;) until they come up to temperature. They lamb makes the whole concoction sooooo incredibly flavorful! I&#039;m glad my three favorite bloggers have such synergy when it comes to meatballs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Emma in Seattle]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are fantastic. I left out the Aleppo pepper and cayenne (for &quot;that&#039;s too spicy!&quot; children) and added a 1/2 tsp of allspice, so good with lamb. Love the all-oven method.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We made these yesterday (although we forgot to add the egg, they seemed to bind fine). With couscous and home made tzakiki. &lt;br /&gt;They&#039;re really tasty, and I *love* your bake-only approach (the thing I like least about making ordinary meatballs is the frying in deep-ish oil).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have made the smitten kitchen version several times and it is my family&#039;s favorite recipe from the book!  Can&#039;t wait to try with lamb, but we like the turkey version A LOT.  I skip the smashed chickpea salad in favor of my own recipe for hummus (daughter prefers smooth texture)with a touch of sumac added, and serve with warm pita bread, tszatsiki, tomatoes and crunchy lettuce.  The meatballs are so delicious.]]></description>
