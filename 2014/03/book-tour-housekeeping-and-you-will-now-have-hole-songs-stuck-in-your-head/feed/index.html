					<description><![CDATA[Oh, no! I lost track of time and got behind in my blog reading and can&#039;t believe I just missed your book reading tonight in Wellesley! I look forward to reading the new book, I&#039;m sure I will love it like I love all of your writing and recipes! I make many of your recipes, often! Guess I&#039;ll have to wait until you&#039;re back for your next book... have a great book tour! And some day I&#039;ll get back out to Seattle to make it to Delancey...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another reason to wish that I lived in America! But I must be thankful that your new book is available from Amazon UK, in fact it has been sitting on my wish list since I first found out about it.....and I have a birthday in just 11 days time so have my fingers crossed. If I don&#039;t get given it, well, I will just &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to buy it for myself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh no!  I live just down the street from Greenlight and was excited to see that you&#039;re coming to give a talk.  But I&#039;ll be out of town that day for work.  I guess you&#039;ll just have to write a third book and come visit us in Brooklyn some other time...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh how I (and lots of other lovely people here, I&#039;m sure!) would LOVE to see you in Ann Arbor!! Having recently moved here from Brooklyn, I&#039;m amazed at how this town supports local book stores. Also we have zingermans and it&#039;s wonderful. Do come, please! :) ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, Allison here. I used to live in Seattle and sit at the kitchen bar in Delancy and riff with your husband and the other cool people there and drink tasty, tasty drinks made with just a few perfect ingredients. Then I moved to my home, Missoula. Now am in SLC with my love. But I miss the scene in Seattle and Missoula too, believe it or not. I was happy to see all of the SLC votes, and understand with a sad heart that you can&#039;t add us. Just know you are so incredibly wonderful delightful and after catching up on some of your posts realize I need to make this a more frequent ritual. Thank you for your delightful writing, it makes me happy.]]></description>
