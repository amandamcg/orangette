					<description><![CDATA[Every time I&#039;m at my sister&#039;s I find myself going through orangette as my brother in law is such a good eater. He always gets excited whenever I make something and volunteers to go grocery shopping.  Last time I was here I made your chocolate chip cookies and Graham crackers. This time I&#039;m going for guacamole .  Cheecake and tiramisu are also on the menu , although not supplied by orangette.  Max , Molly , here&#039;s to you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really love guacamole and the inclusion of onions always wins with me, thanks for the post - it was a nice read. My girlfriend got me in to avocado last year and I have it with a lot of things now, including strong cheddar on a sandwich. Delightful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://bournbrookterrace.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this for watching football this afternoon, but with minor adjustments so I didn&#039;t have to go to the store (all jalapeño, shallot instead of onion). It is so good. We like our guacamole to be strong on the lime side, and I enjoy more cilantro than most. It got better the more I ate. Thank you Molly!]]></description>
