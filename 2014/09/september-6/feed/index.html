					<description><![CDATA[Michele!  We would LOVE some!!!! YES!!!!  I think freshly picked and carefully packed in a box would be just fine, but maybe we should e-mail about it. Feel free to drop me a line at delanceyseattle@gmail.com.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seeing this post reminded me of your affection for Italian prune plums. I love them, too. This week it looks as though we will have a bumper crop in north central Idaho. Do you need some? I could send a couple pounds to the restaurant, although I could use some advice regarding the best method for shipping e.g, freshly picked and carefully cushioned in a box? pitted and in dry ice?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for such lovely images and thoughts, I loved reading it. I have just started my own blog, http://bournbrookterrace.com/2014/09/22/autumn-equinox-and-mushrooms/ - please do have a look if you get time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I smell onions, oil or fried vegetables I go back to a sweaty car in India going through Himachal Pradesh, stopping at a roadside for strong black tea. I would go back to that moment any time, any where.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh, Molly, I love this post. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my &#039;olden days&#039; (i.e. my 20s) I spent a lot of time walking my rescued Beagle. I hadn&#039;t yet married my husband and I lived in a tiny apartment with just my dog. Every evening after work I would take him for a walk. Much like you, I dreaded it in the dark months. We did the same thing - walk along streets with beautiful old two-story homes (in our case) and I&#039;d look longingly into the glowing houses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a toddler daughter now and a different dog, so our dog walks are very different and lovely in their own way, but I do reflect warmly on all those (many many) walks I took with my sweet old dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for the beautiful familiar post. Lovely writing as always.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t had the time to read your blog in so long, however, I got the chance to catch up tonight. You were the first food blogger I ever followed and I love your stories as much today as I did eight years ago. I got the chance to meet you at Chelsea Market in 2010 where I finally purchased A Homemade Life. I went home and read it for two days straight and it was so familiar to me and brought so much comfort to a 23 year old who had just moved to NYC a couple of months prior. I cried buckets when reading about the passing of your father and felt like I was getting a prep course for a tragic day that I will never be prepared for in my own life. I say all of that to say, thank you. Thank you for using your talents to bring not only delicious recipes but a sense of connection and commonality to strangers who feel like friends.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#039;below language&#039;--perfect.  You&#039;ve made me cry.  Sensory memories are so strong, and so vivid.  &lt;br /&gt;I, too, have rediscovered a sensory memory from my childhood cabin.  No words, but as soon as I stepped into a particular antiques store I remembered that smell of my youth, and our family&#039;s cabin.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is said old white table where your pretty header was taken?  I saw your old pics and that was the first thing I thought of - your pretty kitchen scene in that lovely, filtered light.  As always, I so enjoy your writing and photography!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, just gifted my honey with a cooking class with Becky Selengut at Delancey, and he LOVED it!  You have your hands in so many interesting things!]]></description>
