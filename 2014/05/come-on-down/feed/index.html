					<description><![CDATA[Mollie...loved both of your books!  Will you be posting any of your recipes from Delancey? I&#039;m specifically interested in the Siracha Shrimp one.  Both books are on my kindle, so it&#039;s more of of a challenge to print them :)   Am heading out to Seattle to visit family in November, and I&#039;ve made them promise to take me to Delancey!  &lt;br /&gt;Thanks!  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m loving &#039;Delancey&#039;! I also want to tell you that today I made your Coeur a la creme recipe for the first time. The perfect little heart shaped porcelain moulds filled with delicious creamy mixture are setting in the fridge as I write. I can hardly wait for tomorrow and will have to try extra hard not to eat one for breakfast :o)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just finished Delancy! Stayed up late on a school night. My second graders may mention that I look tired tomorrow, but it was so worth it! Molly, you are one talented gal! Thank you for sharing your authentic self with the world. Wishing you and Brandon years of success. When I finally get to the Pacific NW I will be stopping in to be a part of the dinner party! ]]></description>
