					<description><![CDATA[I am really enjoying Delancey. I love the way you write. I, too, have sobbed, out-of-the-blue, over a meal! I am only a few pages from the end! I do and I don&#039;t, want to finish it! And to me, that is the measure of a Good Book! Thank you. Now, when does your next book come out?! HA! No pressure! Hope to see you in Portland in June!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Its funny how your life markers get tied into someone whom you&#039;ve never met. I so clearly remember reading your first book at the prepice of going back to school, and now I have yours on order to my new arctic home. None of this was even imaginable. Its nice to have your writing as a guide of the passage of time. Congratulations on your new book!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly!&lt;br /&gt;Long time reader, first time commenter from Sydney, Australia! I came across your blog very randomly as a 16 year old girl in 2008 and have been following your cooking adventures ever since. I pre-ordered Delancey through iBooks and devoured it in two days! I can&#039;t wait to eat there one day, it&#039;ll be my first stop in Seattle. Congratulations on a wonderful book :)&lt;br /&gt;Bronte]]></description>
