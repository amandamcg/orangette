I use Pillsbury all purpose flour, but I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s the butter..I just realized I&#039;d been using margarine, not unsalted real butter. I&#039;ll try it again to see.]]></description>

That&#039;s so strange! I&#039;ve made four batches from this recipe this week. What brand and type of flour are you using? I wonder if you need to cook them a bit longer? They will develop tiny cracks (hair-width) along the top when they&#039;re ready, but they will still feel a bit soft until they cool.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve tried making these numerous times and always ended up with the same result, doughy like they aren&#039;t fully cooked, not crunchy like shortbread cookies should be, no matter how long or what temp I cook them at..I don&#039;t understand where I&#039;m going wrong :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://orangette.net/2014/12/a-good-reason/#comment-45022&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt;.

Mark, I wonder if you accidentally mismeasured the butter?  I just did some Googling to see how my recipe compared to other recipes for the same cookies, and it&#039;s almost identical to most of them. (Here&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/russian-tea-cakes-2860&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Epicurious&lt;/a&gt;, for instance.) The recipe here is correct. I wish I could be of more help!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was so excited when I saw this recipe as I thought my dear departed mother took her famous Russian tea cakes to the grave. I just spent the last hour trying to make these cookies but I am convinced the recipe is wrong. You call for  2 1/4 cups of flour ‚Äì ‚Äì as I was mixing the flour in after one cup, I thought ‚Äì ‚Äì this is much too much flour and sure enough by the time I folded the full 2 1/4 cups of flour into the butter mixture, it would no longer adhere to the butter.   I had no choice but to throw the whole thing away ‚Äì ‚Äì hoping someone will get back to me and let me know if I&#039;m right and the recipe is wrong  with waaaay too much flour called for and it should more like one cup of flour -- or what did I do wrong?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My grandma, Velma Small used to adapt these at Christmas by putting a filling of crushed candy canes, powdered sugar, cream cheese, and a little milk to mix. Then she&#039;d make a hole for the filling, cover it with more dough and when they came out of the oven, roll them in a 1/2 powered sugar 1/2 crushed candy cane mix. Just made 6 dozen. My son loves them!]]></description>
