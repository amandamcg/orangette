					<description><![CDATA[Just as I finished reading A Homemade Life, which we have hand sold by the dozens at Darvill&#039;s Bookstore on Orcas Island, I started a new book review blog today!  In distinct reaction to all the sugar of the season, this one is titled &quot;Important Ideas&quot;--books that made a difference to me, or writers who really think &quot;outside the box&quot;.  Sorry, no cookbooks, but there is plenty of substance to keep a mind occupied!  Get well soon, maurinetalksbooks@rockisland.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I&#039;m sick I like to read engaging but untaxing chick lit. I recommend books by Jill Mansell and Katie Fforde. Both are British authors, books are set in England and have interesting characters you&#039;d like to live next door to. Feel better soon; there rule is the mothers are not allowed to get sick, or at least not allowed to give in to sickness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[New Yorker day is my favorite day of the week, too! I am right at this moment waiting for your apple bundt cake (aka bread in front of my health-conscious teenage son) to finish baking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to hear everyone&#039;s sick. I just finished a great novel, The Snow Child by Eowyn Ivey, which really took me away to the wilds of Alaska, back in the days when a moose was enough -- and often the only culinary option -- to sustain a small family for the entire winter.]]></description>
