					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve made the peppermint bark you shared for three years now. You don&#039;t really see it in Australia that much, so people often look at me curiously when I get it out, but now I have many converts! I can&#039;t image Christmas without it now! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh man! Mrs. Grossman&#039;s! When I was a kid, my mom ordered a vinyl house from them that you could put stickers on and pull them off again, but the vinyl was wrinkled, so she returned it and they sent a new one with thousands of stickers to make up for it! I STILL have some of those stickers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Apart from saying, once again, thank you for the mention I just wanted to say that I have looked at that peppermint bark every year since you posted it meaning to make it... I&#039;m pretty sure my sister would love it so maybe this is, finally, the year!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I&#039;ve been a longtime reader of the blog and just finished Delancey. It&#039;s perfect! I didn&#039;t clean my house yesterday and instead read the bulk of it. Thank you for allowing yourself to be so open. I can&#039;t wait for the day I get to stop in for a slice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I honestly read that title as &quot;Grits &amp; stuff&quot; and then I read the post through three times and was really upset that there was not a recipe for grits.  And then I realized that it did not say grits. But really. Grits are awesome. Grits please?]]></description>
