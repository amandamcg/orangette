					<description><![CDATA[I had a bowl of your  chocolate granola with whole milk this morning and it made me come back for more granola recipes.  I don&#039;t want my breakfast to be very complicated so making a batch of granola every other week is reasonable .
This one is next on my list , probably tomorrow . Have a nice , warm day]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, I noticed have been making this granola recipe since you posted it - so for 6 years now! How time flies. 

I have a batch in the oven as I type this: it&#039;s been my go-to breakfast during my maternity leave. I have plans to make your (or Dana&#039;s) rhubarb compote this weekend. 

I miss your posts and am looking forward to your book.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been searching high and low for the perfect homemade granola, and I believe I have found it!! The olive oil, oh my what indulgent richness!! I had no idea what my granola truly needed was MORE fat not less. The simplicity of ingredients is deceiving because the complexity of flavors and textures in the finished product is an experience all in itself.  I absolutely love the salty sweetness WITHOUT any additional spices or flavorings added, but then again I appreciate the the aroma and taste of raw rolled oats, I admit my daughter and I will often sneak a handful just for a treat.  I&#039;ve realized I don&#039;t like the flavor of roasted cinnamon in granola or nuts, it always tastes burnt, so I&#039;m happy this recipe leaves it out.  I divided my batch in 4 and left one plain and let my kids flavor the others.  I&#039;m throwing out my other granola recipe cards and am only using this one from now on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this recipe and am always happy with the results (as long as I don&#039;t burn it, ugh). I&#039;ve evolved into making a cherry almond version with slivered almonds as the nut, adding vanilla and almond extract to the maple syrup before mixing it in, and adding dried cherries after baking.  It&#039;s become my go-to granola recipe because the ingredients are easily memorized for spur of the moment grocery shopping &#038; it comes together so quickly and easily. TY]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have never been inspired to make granola until I read your recipe. Not too fancy, I had everything but the coconut at hand. I&#039;m on my second batch in a month and I can&#039;t thank you enough. I&#039;m with you in the &quot;same breakfast every day&quot; school, and this is now an important part of mine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This has been my go-to granola recipe since you posted it. My favorite version is a cherry almond one (use slivered almonds &#038; almond extract and add dried cherries after it&#039;s done baking). I usually add the coconut halfway through the baking because mine always seems to get a little too toasted - but that could just be my oven. I love being able to make granola from things I usually have on-hand and this stuff freezes beautifully. What more could you want?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my, I made this today. So yummy. However, I used coconut oil instead of the olive oil, just because I love that flavor in my granola, and of course it seems to go with the coconut chips.  Sometime I&#039;ll try the olive oil to compare.]]></description>
