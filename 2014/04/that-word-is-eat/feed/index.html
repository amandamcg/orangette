					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly.  I have just finished your book &quot;A Homemade Life&quot; and was struck by your talking about first starting your blog.  We are both Seattlites, though I have far older than you.  I just started a blog less than a year ago and talk about food, too, though I also talk about other things.  I thought our writing styles were similar so I wanted to share this post with you because it has some special recipes and I know you believe in sharing.&lt;br /&gt;http://rosythereviewer.blogspot.com/2013/10/a-baby-boomers-food-memories-with.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosy Brewer]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh I can&#039;t wait to try this recipe, my one year old will love this. I love your reflections on motherhood. It is a strange and familiar identity all at once. In the same breath I think, &quot;Wait, I&#039;m a mother?!&quot; but also, &quot;Of course I am.&quot; June is such a rad gal, with a very rad mama :)]]></description>
