					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;    Good luck tonight! I hope lots of people come to listen to the music!   I had never thought about someone creating music to accompany a non fiction book until just recently when my son-law, Dan Jones, presented me with a CD called Modern Love by David Lockwood which is based on Dan&#039;s column of the same name in the Sunday NYTimes Styles Section. Dan&#039;s book, Love Illuminated, came out in Feb. and is also based on the Modern Love column. You never know what creative endeavor will spawn something quite different. Maybe next we&#039;ll see a movie based on A Homemade Life!........Now I&#039;m off to Trader Joe &#039;s for some good dark chocolate so I can bake that Winning Hearts and Minds cake again.&lt;br /&gt;Bette Hanauer]]></description>
