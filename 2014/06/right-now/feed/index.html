					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m new here and have been reading through your archived posts. I have a 10 month old who is just exploring and expanding her food world, and I&#039;ve loved reading about your food philosophy with June! 

I made this recipe earlier this week and it was a huge hit for all of us. I make our sandwich bread and regularly pulvarize a piece at the end of the loaf for breadcrumbs, and add them to a jar in the freezer. So I used 3oz if those instead of straight up bread and it worked really well. I realized while we were eating the meatballs that there must have been a bit of whole wheat rye bread in the mix - it added a different and lovely dimension! 

I&#039;ll definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing your life with us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I keep returning again and again to this recipe and wondering how this would do with some cooked orzo. Brothy soups make me happy, but I need something more filling for a whole meal. Thanks for the idea!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Always do our stock in a crock pot - the big oval holds sometimes 2 chicken carcasses depending on their size. Overnight on low for 12 or so hours makes one realize crock pot rhymes with stock pot!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Based on the picture included with this post, I have to ask... does June insist on holding the utensil in one hand while eating everything with her fingers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My toddler does it, and not only does it save us from having to wash that utensil but it is also just about the cutest thing. :)]]></description>
