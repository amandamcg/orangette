					<description><![CDATA[We dinner picnic on the beach a few nights per week weather permitting!   I found that growing up here in Victoria, surrounded by water that I can&#039;t STAND being away from the ocean for long.  I instinctively look to catch glimpses of it as I drive about town.  I certainly couldn&#039;t live somewhere for any length of time with it out of sight (and sniffing range!).   I often wonder if my girls will be as tied to this place as I am… ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved your first book and I have read the 2nd in just about 3 days. As I was reading Chapter 15 and your&lt;br /&gt;describing the Tomato corn salad, I thought to myself, &quot;I hope this recipe is in here!&#039; Yeah, it was. I&#039;m so making this for our family picnic in July. I love your books &amp;&lt;br /&gt;blog]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a Texas girl &amp; I would relish any close access to the ocean (or water...).  I also have a curly girlie named Emma Grace who is 1. I would tell you to relish every second because you will blink &amp; she will no longer be little. Thanks for your books &amp; Orangette, I am a book home cook fan!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stopping by again to tell you that in the midst of reading &#039;Delancey&#039; I found time to make the Chocolate Cupcakes from &#039;A Homemade Life&#039;. Molly, they are the best chocolate cupcakes! I was going to be faithful to your recipe and use the chocolate glaze but in the end used up some white chocolate (to prevent me eating it) and did a frosting instead. And drizzled that with dark chocolate. Amazingly, two days later, there are still some left. &lt;br /&gt;Here&#039;s link (I tried to embed but it wouldn&#039;t let me)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely beautiful pictures thank you for sharing! I picked up Delancey and started reading it the other day. This is the first book of yours I am reading and I wasn&#039;t too sure how I would enjoy it. Please don&#039;t get me wrong, I enjoy your blog, but would the book be too much? I also tend to be more of a fiction book reader which is, of course, my issue. I&#039;m less than a quarter of the way through and the verdict is in... LOVE IT! Thank you!!!!]]></description>
