					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been a fangirl for several years - reading your blog and then your first book, and I&#039;m planning a trip to Powell&#039;s this week to pick up your new book. I am also a PacNW girl (down in Portland) and many of your recipes have become staples in our family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chocolate cupcakes with ganache were our wedding cupcakes, and I&#039;ve made many a friend giving jars of your spicy pickled carrots (although I often will add a bit of dill because I love the flavor). The waffles - oh goodness. No words...and I can&#039;t imagine a potato salad other than your dad&#039;s gracing our picnic - and now I&#039;ve stumbled back through your steel-cut oatmeal recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now - you have introduced me to some fabulous music. I have The Glowing Heart by Nick Foster playing while I type; love, love, love! I appreciate so much your blog, your writing, and I always look forward to skimming through archives to see if there is some sweet nugget that I&#039;ve missed and can rediscover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations on all of your successes, and best wishes to you and your lovely family.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in the middle of reading Homemade Life and had to stop and check out your blog to get a better sense of who you are. So far, your book has made me laugh, cry, salivate, and make me want to get in the kitchen and stay cooking! I grew up in a big family with a Mom who showed her love through food, and I&#039;m happy to say I&#039;ve carried on her tradition (except for the big family part). I can&#039;t wait to try some [all] of the recipes. Congrats on the restaurant, I will mention it to my Seattle friends and hopefully get there myself someday!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reading Delancey right now.  Amen to Amazon, what a terrific job.  Your voice is who you are, not anybody else.  That seems easy but no no it isn&#039;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you know my friend Fanny Gerson&#039;s book &lt;i&gt;Paletas&lt;/i&gt;?

					<description><![CDATA[I just finished reading &quot;Delancey&quot; and it was great.  Finished it within 12 hours.  It brought back so many memories of when I was in the food business deli/queens and Long Island NY.  We worked from 5am (good breakfast business, lunches and catering) to 10am.  Made everything from scratch nothing came out of plastic containers.  We were closed on Sunday and we took a week off.  Another deli was on the next block but it worked.  &lt;br /&gt;]]></description>
