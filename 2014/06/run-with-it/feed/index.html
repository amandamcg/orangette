					<description><![CDATA[You mentioned Auntie&#039;s bookstore in Spokane...did you happen to notice that next door to the most awesome restaurant in the 509? And that beats anything in Walla Walla.  Sante Spokane is the best thing that ever happened in the food world east of the Cascades. Hope you got to enjoy it!&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, I&#039;m a big fan of your blog and books; they make my day.  I made your popcicle recipe, but I made them with peaches and a splash of Bourbon. Grand Slam!  Keep up the good work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those raspberry popsicles are an absolute fixture of our summers. Have been since you posted them. Possibly because our summers sort of resemble a mash-up of Mt. St. Helens and Hades. Also, because those popsicles totally pass for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner. (See: yogurt. See: fruit). Thereby releasing one from the need to cook. Or do it all. Or do anything, really. Which is exactly what I&#039;m up for, right around late June. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By which I mean: thanks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xo,&lt;br /&gt;M]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hate to be a downer, but I have the mold you loaned Katie and I hate it.  The popsicles are impossible to get out.  The plastic is really hard and even running hot water over it doesn&#039;t help b/c the plastic doesn&#039;t really conduct heat well.  You can leave them out, but you mostly have to jam a knife between the popsicle and the side of the mold, but that won&#039;t always work.  You can leave them out, but then the whole popsicle is likely to get a little soft and then the stick is likely to come loose.  I&#039;m looking up the silicone molds on Amazon RIGHT NOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.  Loved Delancey, the book and the restaurant  (and Essex) when I went a year ago when I took a business trip to Seattle.&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been reading Orangette for years, but I never comment. I just had a baby boy and I have to tell  you, your posts infused with June are my favorites. I know it can be a little tricky writing about kids, (nothing worse than people who go on and on about their cute kids, right?) but I want you to know that June has a big fan in this corner of the interweb!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How true! Between work and people and all the mini crises that crop up when you&#039;re least expecting them, I find it hard sometimes to spend time writing. I really resonate with the blog/barometer comparison - I find that I&#039;m feeling most balanced when I&#039;m putting up a new post and when I&#039;m happy with the work.]]></description>
