					<description><![CDATA[So, back quite a few years ago now when you called Omnivore to ask about Tender, I was on the phone taking your name and nearly fell off my stool because it was *really you!*, and had to immediately call my mother. I&#039;m glad that it&#039;s still one of your favorites :) Nigel is really the best. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello! I am new to your wonderful writing, which I began reading after listening to the Christopher Kimball interview. I started with Delancey (terrific), and while waiting for your first book to arrive I&#039;m reading your blog backwards (I&#039;m up to 2011), and thoroughly enjoying every bit. Thank you. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The New Yorker article on the Chilean miners was captivating. Leave it to the New Yorker to understand storytelling at its best. This article on the construction of a new highway in India (one that I almost skipped over) still stands out as especially enlightening: http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/10/14/rush-6. Check it out when you can!]]></description>
