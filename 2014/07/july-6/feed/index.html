					<description><![CDATA[Molly and Skye (n.5, I like the sound of that) â€“ THANK YOU! Mosquitoes are my worst enemy whenever I go to see my parents in Venice. They like me a lot. I&#039;m gonna try the oil, and the spoon. Also, I can sympathize with the feeling of thinking too much about love and live and music while smelling like cheese â€“ working at the cheese counter at WF in London :) It was a whole ago, but the only thing that changed is perhaps the smell (yay!), and the music. I am obsessed with The National at the moment, and feel like a teenager wanting to put up posters and following the band around the world. It had been a while since I felt this way for a band, and the feeling is making my summer go so very fast as I am lost in my thoughts...I just wish, like you, I were less busy. I hate busy, and I love laying in the sun thinking about lyrics and love and life and bigger schemes, and dinner. x]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Have you heard the &lt;i&gt;Love This Giant&lt;/i&gt; album he made with St. Vincent? I really like it although I can&#039;t handle looking at the cover art. I had to delete the image from iTunes. You&#039;ll probably like it unless your jealousy of Annie Clark getting to make music with David Byrne is completely overwhelming.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live in New Hampshire, but about ten years ago my now-husband and I spent an incredible week on Lopez. One of the most blissful places I have been. I brought home Holly B&#039;s cookbook from that trip and just today made a fruit crumble (strawberry rhubarb) from it. I turn to that cookbook more than any other for baking. I wonder if her bakery is still there?&lt;br /&gt;So, anyway, it was neat to see your post. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly -- I love this post. I found myself laughing when I read it because I just wrote a very, very similar post over on my site. Like you, I own a small restaurant with my husband (in NYC), so this summer I&#039;ve been craving quiet days at the beach, sans crazy to-lists and restaurant-related projects. Feel free to check it out if you&#039;d like. I loved your new book -- it was the first book I read this summer and I floored through it. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anytime I need to get &quot;un-busy&quot;, I can look back on this post.  You have captured the very essence of relaxation, peace and well-being, the glory of Summer.  Thanks so much.  June will treasure these photos  20 years from now!&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>
