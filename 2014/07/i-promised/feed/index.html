					<description><![CDATA[Good lord. Only two ingredients and it&#039;s milkshake perfection. I picked some sour cherries last week and popped them in the freezer until I could figure out what to do with them. And tonight I realized we had some vanilla ice cream on hand from our favorite local spot: Mallard. They were made for each other. Thank you, Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[fascinating idea.  I adore real cherry pie - I had the fake cherry pie filling pie until I had my first baby and someone brought us a cobbler that made me take notice.  Now, my kids and I regularly pick sour (pie) cherries and pit them on the front porch before freezing them.  We use a big paper clip for pitting - the kids squeeze too much juice out otherwise. Then I make cherry pies and cobblers all winter long.  Will have to remember the milkshake next summer!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are amazing! I maybe went through a quart of ice cream over the weekend. Can&#039;t be sure, it&#039;s always possible elves were involved. No sour cherries near me, so I used the jarred TJ&#039;s cherries as indicated. Splash in some juice if you want a pyrotechnic pink shake.]]></description>
