					<description><![CDATA[From the picture, I expected a recipe for cooking some sort of organ meat.  Then I read the recipe and my first thought was, &quot;Is Endive not just lettuce but also organ meat?&quot;  Then I looked at the picture again and, oh.  Just endive.  Surprising!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This recipe looks wonderful. And I&#039;m so sorry the three of you are sick! My roommate and boyfriend were both recently sick for 8 WEEKS. It was awful, and I don&#039;t know how I remained impervious to it. Still I sympathize with the both of you! Feel better soon. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is uncanny how those of us who have lost a parent - being completely separate people who have lost unique loved ones, never to be repeated - can feel so similarly when we grieve.  Your words sounded like some of the many blog posts I&#039;ve written about my mother, who I only lost a little over a year ago, also to cancer.  The feeling I got reading your words was so familiar, it gave me chills.  How can that be?&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;ve so enjoyed reading your blog for many, many years now and it&#039;s because of your honesty and bravery in sharing your life with us.  It&#039;s a gift and I thank you so much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[By the way if anyone wanted to try their hand at growing endive (or witloof as we tend to call it in Commonwealth countries) they could do a lot worse than turn to the typically clear and forthright advice given by the great American garden writer Eleanor Perényi in her book of garden essays Green Thoughts.  She&#039;ll also tell you how to lay down an asparagus bed too if you want to do that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the second endive recipe I&#039;ve read today; the other was on David Leibovitz&#039;s blog and features endive cooked in butter, wrapped in ham, then topped with bechamel (another commenter  mentioned a similar recipe). I shall take it as a sign that I should eat endive this weekend. Lovely!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cooked it yesterday, and it was very very good. But next time I will substitute two thirds of the butter with olive oil - as it actually says in a recipe of yours from some years back ;-))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, the past two posts have brought me to tears and comments. I lost my dad in December 1993--also a third of my life ago. He too lived large and was irresponsible with his gut (and in so many other ways). How you poignantly mix a recipe for endive, musings on Matthew McConaughey, nursing a bug, and the tender remembrance of your father&#039;s passing,  is a testament to your beautiful and skilled writing. Thank you for nudging my own tender memories.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Literally two hours ago I said to my husband, &quot;It&#039;s been a third of my life since my father died,&quot; and then I went to your blog and read the exact words I&#039;d just said. Like your father, mine was irresponsible in the 80s and 90s-- cheese, meat, bread, butter, pate. He would never have eaten endive, though, and he did die of a heart attack-- a fact that would have annoyed him had he realized it, since he was devoutly anti-wholesome-eating-scolds (he didn&#039;t mind wholesome eating per se but it was not for him). He was a Seattleite since 1969, born in Berkeley in 1940, so wholesome-eating types were all around him. I like your blog in general but have never commented-- I just wanted to say this resonated with me. I love how you describe your dad, irresponsible and full of joie de vivre with his gut-- that was my dad and I adored him. I miss him still. Thank you for bringing both of them alive for a moment.]]></description>
