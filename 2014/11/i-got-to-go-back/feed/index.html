					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;br /&gt;This post was a poignant reminder of early talent and dreams and how they are often deferred (thank God your personal crossroads led you back to writing). I am not sure if the tears that welled up were because you are such an elegant writer, able to spin the every day into luscious prose, or because your journey back to your early &quot;light&quot; reminded me of my own journey (or both). I LOVE the way you write, Molly. Thank you. -- Linda]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly - I&#039;m a regular reader, though infrequent commenter, and it&#039;s your beautiful writing style that keeps me coming back. This post has been one of my favorites, both because it&#039;s completely inspiring and extraordinarily well written. I once heard the writing style in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; described as not wasting a single word. I agree with that analysis, and found myself thinking the same thing about this post. Thank you for sharing! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Found your blog inadvertently, by reading a  restaurant review, but found myself fascinated and also validated. I just returned from walking a portion of the Camino de Santiago in Spain and writing a blog and this blogging stuff seems to tease out all kinds of ideas. Love your words, love this format. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;burgiandjoyce.blogspot.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Such a wonderful surprise to find that the author of the book I had been wanting was teaching the same time I was attending &quot;Exploring Fused Glass&quot; at Quartz Mountain Fall Arts Institute. I loved reading this blog and I am hooked and will continue reading. I had the opportunity to visit with Molly before an Artist Talk, I so enjoyed the ease of the conversation. I am reading &quot;A Homemade Life&quot; and savoring each page. Thank you, Frances Williams]]></description>
