					<description><![CDATA[Yay, hi you too Miss Molly! Working up the scheduling gusto to have time to make rye crumble bars. I&#039;ve only been planning it for years, but I finally have homemade blackberry port jam to make it worthwhile. Congrats on the upcoming book release. Can&#039;t wait to smell the pages and read the words!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved your recent split pea soup recipe, but making everything including my chicken stock to the letter, it came out very thin more of a watery consistency.  I am used to thicker split pea soup.  Is that the way it should be, or can I do anything to thicken it up in the next try??]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back! I&#039;m currently eating a bowl of granola I made based on your Granola Recipe #4. I&#039;ve made about 5 batches in the few weeks. And you&#039;ve now inspired me to move up &quot;We are Called to Rise&quot; on my reading list from &quot;sometime&quot; to &quot;next&quot;. A new post from you always feels like a sweet little present!  ]]></description>
