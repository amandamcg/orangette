					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly,&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#039;ve been to your site (I&#039;m late to the game but excited to read your blog). I just finished your book, A Homemade Life, and it was wonderful. I found it at the library but I&#039;m ordering it from Amazon. It&#039;s worth owning! The stories are great and the recipes look amazing. I made the scones right away and they are delicious! Your sister&#039;s tip was exactly what I needed to overcome my fear of scones. I always thought they would be easy to screw up but these came out perfect. I&#039;m so glad you have another book coming. I can&#039;t wait to read it. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hurrah!  I just pre-ordered Delancey this weekend from Santoro&#039;s Books on Greenwood.  I got A Homemade Life in 2009 and have been thinking for years that I should tell you that although I am a total sucker for food memoirs with recipes and I read through them like wildfire, I have never, ever actually cooked a recipe from any of them, except for A Homemade Life.  I&#039;ve made at least a third of the recipes in there and a number of them are in fairly regular rotation at our house.  So thank you, Molly.]]></description>
