					<description><![CDATA[An American friend put me onto your website a little while ago. Am so glad she did. I was wondering if you&#039;d ever considered adding a splash of Angostura bitters to make a lemon, lime and bitters curd. (The idea is not mine, by the way. There is a shop in Moss Vale, about two hours&#039; drive southwest of Sydney, which sells only products made within ten kilometre radius of the shop. They had jams and curds on sale, one of which was lemon, lime and bitters. I stole the idea.) It&#039;s now my favourite spread, alongside my rhubarb and orange jam.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My little Improved Meyer Lemon tree had three little lemons on it. They were almost entirely juice on the inside, so I had more than enough for this recipe. I used Irish butter, and 1/3 cup local honey instead of sugar. Amazing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was so enthralled with the recipe for lime curd that I didn&#039;t notice - until now - that you were eating it spread on Walker&#039;s Pure Shortbread Scotties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on Thursday I was in the Hell&#039;s Kitchen Sur La Table going through the cookie cutters because the sign said they had scotties and, eureka, I pulled two cookie cutters out, only to discover later that I had gotten schnauzers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it or not, in my travels that same day I came upon the SoHo Sur La Table and was able to exchange them.  Now I just have to find a recipe that lets me cut shortbread instead of patting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HaHa.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the first time I&#039;m making curd - I blitzed the egg and citrus juice together as one person suggested before adding them to the rest of the ingredients.  Things seemed to work well until I paddled from the pan to the serving jar, as soon as I took the heat off either the butter or the juice seemed to separate.  I jarred it anyway and it&#039;s in the fridge now, I&#039;m anxiously waiting to see what the liquid on top is going to solidify to.]]></description>
