					<description><![CDATA[So, I really, really like this post. Its so honest and I love how you&#039;re all &quot;just eat and don&#039;t freak out about it&quot;, which is honestly something I&#039;m trying to do as I feed myself, the adult. I don&#039;t have kids yet, but I hope I can approach food with my own kids similar to the way you do, if I ever have them. I&#039;m a nurse, and I&#039;ve worked in pediatrics for the past few years, so I can say from observation that plenty of parents should probably take a deep breath and count to ten before every meal. But I&#039;ve also learned that you&#039;ve just got to do the best you can, which is probably what most parents try to do anyway. Thanks for your honest and amusing writing, I always find it so inspiring.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Whatever is true today may not be true tomorrow.&quot; That pretty much nails it!  By the way, our girls were playing together a little bit at the zoo today, and it just hit me that it was you as I was reading this article! She&#039;s a sweet baby. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post! It reminds le ro relax a bit. This is my personal philosophy, though with the addition that four year olds (my oldest) can handle to be told they have to sit on their chair and eat more than one spoon of the dinner. But, beeing monitored by nurses and doctors telling you your kid is not gaining bought weight, by far, (my youngest) can make anyone stressed out and act against your own gut feeling. Like, ok, i know i should not coax her, but come on, they are going to weigh her tomorrow! And will not care very much that she is full of energy, not picky and generally happy and active (yes, the climbing type of toddler). Only that she is not following the expected curve for her birth weight. I need this reminder. Hey, she loves beans, why should she not get them just because some dietician says she needs more energy, at least if she eats beans she eats something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for deciding to write this post.  I am so happy to read that I am not alone in the fact that my son prefers to eat fruit, milk and meat (plus carbs).  Oh the meat eating, my son is a true carnivore.  He will even eat fish. &lt;br /&gt;I love your whole approach to feeding June, I take the same approach but I didn&#039;t find the peace this approach brings until my son was about 13 months and stopped eating anything green. I fretted constantly over it, and I wish I had just let go sooner but I guess we all have to find our own way in our own time.  Thank you again, I really enjoyed reading this and seeing some pictures of June!]]></description>
