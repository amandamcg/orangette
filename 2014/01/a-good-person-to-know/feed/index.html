					<description><![CDATA[I woke up early this morning only to be testing this recipe. I made it three months ago and somehow forgot about it  (forgive me!) , but I&#039;m back on track.  I&#039;m out of sugar but I guess muscovado will do the trick as you mentioned. I have a jar of fancy maple syrup that someone gave me recently and that has been patiently sitting in the pantry  , you know where it&#039;s going now!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://orangette.net/2014/01/a-good-person-to-know/#comment-45689&quot;&gt;susan&lt;/a&gt;.

Susan, I&#039;m sorry for the confusion!  To the best of my knowledge, the &quot;subscribe&quot; thingie beneath the comment window is not a way of subscribing to the blog; it just means that you want to receive notifications whenever someone comments on this particular post. (And you probably don&#039;t want that, unless you asked a question in the comments and are waiting for a reply!) That said, I&#039;m not sure why the SUBSCRIBE link in the sidebar isn&#039;t working for you.  Hmm.  I just tried it myself in both Safari and Chrome, and it worked normally.  Do you have the latest version of Safari?  I wonder if it&#039;s a software issue...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi . Just making this oatmeal for the 2nd time this week. yay!

Wanted to let you know in case others are having any difficulty with subscribing...I have been trying to subscribe via the subscribe button under your HI THERE on your home page, but it wouldn&#039;t work. (am working in Safari). This is the message I got...&#039;There is no application set to open the URL feed://feeds.feedburner.com/Orangette.&#039;

 When I got the ingenious idea to scroll to the bottom of the comments section, I found the SUBSCRIBE written in brown(?) and clicking on that took me to the place I could subscribe. Yay.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the recipe! I made it before bed last night, and we loved it at breakfast. Here in Switzerland we get oats that aren&#039;t steel cut, but seem to be less processed than North American rolled oats. They&#039;re heftier, and take longer to cook. They worked perfectly in this. We loved the texture and flavour to this oatmeal, and I think it&#039;s going to change my usual morning procedure. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I often make steel cut oats, though have never thought of toasting them first! Will investigate. Also - I typed in Diamond Crystal Brand Kosher salt into Amazon to add some to my next order - the 3rd option that comes up is Delancey! I guess it&#039;s no secret it&#039;s your go-to :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I never thought I&#039;d be fanatic about oatmeal but this recipe is truly delicious. I&#039;ve already made it twice this week and am already planning to make it again. I have been using a shortcut that works well for me though (especially being 7+ months pregnant with a 32 pound toddler on my hip); after I toast the oats in butter, I add the milk and water to the same pan, bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Yum!]]></description>
