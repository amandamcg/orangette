Yes! I find this too. Nasty taste on the tongue. 
I’ve halved the amount of baking powder and it’s much better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chiming in 5 years later - I had some leftover cooked wild rice in the fridge and decided to try it here in place of the oatmeal. I halved the recipe, but still used a whole egg, and used chocolate chips and raspberries for the mixins. Delicious!]]></description>

Did you have to change the amount of flour using GF?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this recipe! I loved it! 
The first time I made them, I had some very ripe bananas and since I was going to feed them to my 1yr old baby, I added 2 bananas and only used 2 Tbsp of brown sugar. They turned out sweet and moist and they taste wonderful the next day and even 3-4 days later (kept in the fridge and warm them in the oven for a few mins). 
Now I&#039;ve done this recipe a handful of times, always with bananas and some times with 2 Tbsp of flaxseed and a bit extra butter. Always a hit. My baby loves them, and so does the rest of the family!]]></description>

If you do try with less baking powder, let me know how they turn out! I use Rumford brand (aluminum-free) baking powder, and I have never noticed a metallic aftertaste. I&#039;ve been making them every couple of weeks lately - oatmeal season! Keep me posted.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Does anybody else find that these muffins have a slightly bitter, metallic after taste?  The recipe calls for roughly twice as much baking powder as most muffin recipes out there (4 tsp). As it had been reposted on numerous sites and been enthusiastically endorsed by so many cooks, I trusted the measurements. Very disappointing! I may try again with the more normal 2-2-1/2 tsps of baking powder.  Other than the bitter aftertaste they are everything they promised.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are delicious and very easy to throw together. They are also a very sneaky way to make a partly whole grain muffin for skeptics. I used raisins as my add ins and was very pleased with the result. Thanks for passing along the recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So we had twins about a month ago, and needed something to be able to eat one handed and hand to our three year old on her way out the door. I have made these every three days or so for the past two weeks and here are my notes:

2 eggs makes a fluffier muffin, so you can add in more stuff. We put in half cup of chocolate chips and half cup of dried cranberries. 

Mashing half a banana into the oatmeal does two good things. First, the muffins stay moister the next day. Second, you then have a leftover half banana to give to said three year old while they&#039;re baking, because otherwise she&#039;s STARRRRRRVIIIIIING.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this recipe! Easy alternative...Pacific Foods makes a ready-to-eat, organic, steel-cut oatmeal that is perfect for this. It comes in a 10oz, single serving carton, and in apple cinnamon, maple brown sugar, flax chia, original, and unsweetened. I make these all the time now, not limited by needing &quot;left over&quot; oatmeal. Flavor variety. Just substitute 1ctn oatmeal for the 1 cup called for in the recipe.]]></description>
