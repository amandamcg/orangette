					<description><![CDATA[Paula, how maddening that the link broke!  Just as well, though, because I don&#039;t really care for that stock anymore.  If I&#039;m not making my own, I tend to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.superiortouch.com/retail/products/better-than-bouillon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Better Than Bouillon&lt;/a&gt;.  I think it&#039;s far and away the best.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Grow your own Green Garlic, either in a pot or the garden, inside or outside. Use store bought garlic bulbs. Bury single cloves 1 inch apart and 2 inches deep, or the whole head which will come up as a clump, as many stalks as the number of cloves in the head. Plant in the Fall or early Spring. Single cloves planted will give nicer sized stalks. I grow lots of it.  Slice it small and freeze it or dry it to use in soups etc, if you can&#039;t use it fresh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used Rapunzel vegan vegetable bouillon w/sea salt.  I must have accidentally bought the one with salt, usually don&#039;t. That explains how it got so salty.  I didn&#039;t have spinach, so I used Swiss chard - used about 6 big leaves. Could definitely use more.  Didn&#039;t want to buy creme fraiche when I had goat cheese &amp; yummy Strauss unsweetened yoghurt at home.  Threw in about 4T yoghurt, 3T goat cheese.  IT WAS AMAZING! This is my first time making green garlic soup, only had it in restaurants &amp; always loved it. Will be making this all (short) season. THANK YOU!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this last night with regular garlic (4 cloves) and low-sodium chicken stock.  It came out a little bland and the garlic flavor wasn&#039;t as strong as I hoped it to be (I love garlic!)  I forgot to add scallions or shallot at the beginning and I think this would have helped.  I added salt at the end too but think I should have added more. I&#039;m not discouraged though and will make this again!  The color is magnificent and I think some croutons would be a nice garnish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green garlic will definitely be added to our garden this fall or spring as I&#039;m horrible about making it to the farmer&#039;s market here in Austin...]]></description>
