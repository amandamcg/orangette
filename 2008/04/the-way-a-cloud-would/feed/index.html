					<description><![CDATA[I made the rochers twice the weekend, once with almonds and once with chocolate chips.  I&#039;ve never attempted any Tartine recipes before.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked absolutely fine both times.  You just have to make sure to beat the hell out of the meringue in the stand mixer (5+ minutes on high speed).  It should be super thick and glossy, and the meringure should be almost impossible to shake off the whisk.  That&#039;s when it&#039;s done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly- this is now the 2nd comment I&#039;ve left in one day...I found your site today and here it is nearly midnight in Wisconsin and I can&#039;t stop reading...and dreaming of what I&#039;ll bake first thing in the morning. I had to comment b/c I too have had nothing but trouble with every single recipe I&#039;ve tried in the Tartine book...very discouraging and I&#039;ve been a home baker for years. Thanks for posting this recipe b/c I&#039;ve been wanting to make good rochers ever since a trip to provence with our boys a few years back- they were delicious and you can&#039;t find them here in Wisconsin! Thanks, too, for a very enjoyable evening of reading and salivating over your recipes! -stephanie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;/&gt;This post is late in the game but here goes. . .I&#039;ve made the almond rochers from the Tartine cookbook several times and they&#039;ve turned out nice. I also make them twice as large-- closer in size to the bakery version at Tartine. I haven&#039;t tried to replicate Tartine&#039;s cocoa nib version. I wonder if there is a trick to it, something they do differently than with the almond ones. The only other thing I can say about them is that I use very fresh eggs from my chickens, sometimes the eggs are still warm. I have found fresh eggs make the best meringue.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i agree completely about traveling and coming home.  it&#039;s so strange at first, and then it&#039;s like discovering everything you love all over again.  &lt;/&gt;and i just tried cocoa nibs for the first time a few days ago.  i kept thinking, where have these been all my life??  nibs wrapped up in a creamy cloud of goodness would be even better, i think. xo]]></description>
