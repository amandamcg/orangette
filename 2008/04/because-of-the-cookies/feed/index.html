					<description><![CDATA[These are probably my favorite cookies ever. I&#039;ve been making them since at least 2009 when I spotted them on your blog. I&#039;m about to make them this weekend again and am going to try out something new. I hope I don&#039;t ruin the loveliness that are these cookies! I&#039;m going to use meyer lemon instead of regular (because that&#039;s what&#039;s growing on the fruit tree) and I&#039;m going to attempt to incorporate raspberries or blackberries into the glaze. Fingers crossed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[in the quest for a cookie suitable for a summer pig roast, i selected this recipe.  i substituted fresh lemon juice for the buttermilk/vanilla in the glaze for a tangier finish.  and i won two awards--most creative, and best all-around.  thanks for a zesty treat!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I realize this post is a year old, but I just wanted to say these were DELICIOUS! Wonderful little cakey bites of goodness! Thank you for posting a halved version of the recipe. I ate way too many and would have eaten many more if I&#039;d baked up a whole batch! Yummy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are SO delicious!  I just finished your book (loved it and can&#039;t wait to try the zucchini noodles) and discovered your blog.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I made these cookies on a whim, for dinner with some in-laws, and the 4 kids and 4 adults devoured the entire batch.  I will definitely be making these again!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I followed the recipe except I used bleached flour since that was all I had.  Excellent!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For the people that had trouble with them spreading out, I would suggest chilling the dough before baking, or even chilling the cookie sheet with the unbaked cookies. I just did this as a precaution, after reading about some of the problems....turned out great. And yes, I know that this recipe is not traditionally Christmas material, but I like to throw one item into my gifts that&#039;s not full of chocolate and/or copious amounts of butter. But just one!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had the buttermilk and it was past expiration date so I thought I better finally do these cookies.  They are wonderful.  Simple, refreshing and just right for a hot summer day when you do want a cookie.  My old father will love these, his batch is ready to be delivered.  Thanks for sharing and reminding me of Edna Lewis again, made me buy one of her cookbooks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, these absolutely deserved a shout.  I made them as soon I got that issue and they were unbelievable!  Unfortunately, I was the only one who thought so - others clamor for chocolate chips.  But they&#039;re worth making for myself once in a while.  And they are really, really good with lemonade.]]></description>
