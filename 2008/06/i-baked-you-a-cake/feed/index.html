					<description><![CDATA[Thank you! I just harvested carrots from my garden - lots of carrots. My husband mentioned carrot ginger soup, which I am sure would be terrific, and healthy, but I was already dreaming of carrot cake. I decided to check your recipes and voila! About to dig in and bake! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have baked the cake a few times now and it really is the best carrot cake I know. But I do have a problem with the rising of the dough, maybe Molly or someone else can help. I never bake two layers, but combine the dough in one cake pan. What happens is that the cake stays rather flat and often sinks a bit in the middle. I tried to be extra careful with overmixing and check and rotate the cake only after 3/4 of the time. I wonder if I need to change something with the baking soda/ baking powder? Glad to hear if someone has an idea about it. Thanks in advance. Also for sharing yet another great recipe! Cheers, Maike]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Toss in a can of crushed pineapple in its own juice. Makes it super moist and dense and downright tropical. I always use raisins, too.  And sometimes coconut as well.  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;I made this cake today, raisins included, and it was good. I mean really good, I had maybe two and a half slices and we had company over, I couldn&#039;t help it, it was GOOD. I&#039;ve been reading Kim Boyce&#039;s Good to the Grain and she suggests adding crÃ¨me fraiche to whipped cream; I tried it in the frosting and it was ethereal. Probably on a hot day it would melt but we were buried under snow in Victoria so the cloud-soft frosting was perfect.]]></description>
