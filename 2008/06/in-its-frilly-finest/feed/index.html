					<description><![CDATA[I came by to tell you thanks for the great recipe! I need a refresher course on these and saw yours. I added a few more seasongings to mine though. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You know what&#039;s funny, my oldest was sticking butter between each slice once they were baked, too. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks! I just blogged about them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am in love with these potatoes. I&#039;m making one for lunch - only 56 mins to go (it&#039;s a big one.) I&#039;m making the garlic-studded variety and I haven&#039;t even got as far as thinking about what might go well with it - just a touch of butter, and I think the potato is all I need.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I took these as inspiration, and I made them with giant roasting potatoes, SLICES OF TURKEY BACON between each little slice of goodness (cooked separately and then slipped in near the end), and grated ricotta salata over the top, and some mozz- mmmm. It was dinner. I love your blog! Thank you for all the recipes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little late to the party, but as soon as I saw this post I had to make me some Hasselback potatoes! I ended up putting slivers of shallots between the slices, and they were divine. If I make any kind of meat-and-potatoes sort of meal my husband feels like he should have gravy for his potatoes. I like gravy too, but sometimes it&#039;s just more than I want to do. He loved these, and never even mentioned the lack of gravy with the meal :o) I think he ate about three. They are now firmly entrenched in my cooking repetoire.]]></description>
