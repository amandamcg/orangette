					<description><![CDATA[Kathleen, I&#039;m sorry for not replying sooner!  This may be too late, but: yes, absolutely, you can make this a few days ahead.  No problem at all!  And how fun that you ran into Brandon.  We&#039;re usually at the market every Sunday, picking up stuff for Delancey and home.  Next time, please say hi!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly!  I&#039;m thinking of having the MHS tweaked tomato sauce at a dinner far away from our home and am wondering if it could be made ahead of time.  Do you think this would be alright chilled &amp; then re-heated a few days later?  Thanks so much.  (BTW, I bought veggies next to Brandon at the BFmkt a few weeks ago and was star-struck, not able to even say hi and that I appreciated Delancey and your blog so much.  I&#039;d probably drool with my jaw hanging down if I ran into you.  You&#039;re Food Stars in my book.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hi molly - never commented here before, but was going through bookmarking ice cream recipes (even though it hasn&#039;t been above 20 degrees here in days, i still want ice cream!) when i saw this recipe. baked pasta (or pasta pie, as we call it) was one of the first dinners my husband and i started making when we started dating 4+ years ago and still make it fairly regularly. we love it with bow tie pasta or small shells, vodka sauce (homemade when there&#039;s time) and good mozzerella and parm. its always hard to have a reasonable portion size!&lt;br /&gt;on another note, i was trying to figure out what east coast heat wave you were referring to (we were living in boston when you posted this and i can&#039;t remember it ever being very hot in june.) then i remembered. . . we were actually on vacation, in Seattle, at that time! great city, although it was a bit on the cool side.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made this for the first time yesterday.  We are on vacation in Durango, CO and it was a wet 45 degree night. Not a big pasta fan but this was great.  I mean like REALLY great.  It was even better left over and by two year old loved it.  Kudos to you again my girl!!]]></description>
