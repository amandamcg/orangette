					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://orangette.net/2008/07/the-important-parts/#comment-10233&quot;&gt;Michelle&lt;/a&gt;.

I planted a Blenheim apricot tree when I fell head over heels with the fruit! 
I bought one fairly  sturdy (? I am not a gardener!) so the following summer it produced a dozen or so, last year  it produced two dozen or more, and this summer it was full.  The key is knowing when to pick them BEFORE the *)[]_ ants and birds attack!]]></description>
