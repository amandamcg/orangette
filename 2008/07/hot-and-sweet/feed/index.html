					<description><![CDATA[Have you ever tried adding fried, sliced shallots to this salad? I used to work in the offices at Wild Ginger, and would order the Green Papaya Salad with fried shallots all the time for summer lunches. They have this fantastic chewy yet crispy texture combined with a mild, sweet, oniony flavor. Of course, boiling oil doesn&#039;t sound particularly fun given the current temperature in Seattle, but if you&#039;re feeling ambitious, they are really tasty.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, that sounds like the Vietnamese papaya salad my mom use to make when I was younger.  Instead of the unripe mango, she used unripe papaya and tossed it the fish sauce dressing.  Dee-lish!  I&#039;ll definitely have to try the mango version! ^_^]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad you&#039;re spreading the Amster-Burton word. He also writes a column (http://www.culinate.com/columns/bacon) for us, and we talked him into sharing some of his pad Thai recipes on our site: http://www.culinate.com/columns/bacon/phat_pad_thai. Enjoy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Every time I read your blog it just gets better! Pâté de campagne in a a boiling hot kitchen - not my idea of a relaxing afternoon. Suggestion about the veggies, though - eat them raw! I am South African and we eat a lot of veggies raw since they can be sliced, grated and marinated in a variety of sauces, oils, vinaigrettes and what have you and kept refrigated for ages. Just an idea .....  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks for your blog, though  - I try and read it as often as I can!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Molly. I&#039;ve been reading your blog for a while now. Today is a first for me commenting. When I first started my own food blog, I looked to yours for inspiration because it was one of the 1st ones I&#039;d ever read.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&#039;Tis the season for Vietnamese fare, methinks. I made a &lt;&gt;cha gio&lt;&gt; salad yesterday. Too hot for much of anything else.]]></description>
