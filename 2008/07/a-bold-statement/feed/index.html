					<description><![CDATA[Holy smokes!  I printed this recipe so long ago but just got around to actually making them this weekend.  These are hands down the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made, and I fancy myself a baker.  The perfect texture, flavor, and chocolatey-ness.  I used the two different flours since I had them in my cupboard and I am a believer. Thank you, thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Carol! I wish I knew what to tell you, but I sadly know nothing about baking at high altitude.  I am useless!  If I were you, I would do a Google search for some high altitude baking tips or a high altitude chocolate chip cookie recipe to see how it differs from this one. But as for the convection question, I can indeed tell you that yes, I do like the way these cookies turn out with convection.  I&#039;ve baked them in both convection and conventional ovens, and they work in both.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Help! What changes should I make for high altitude baking (6,000 feet)?  I tried the recipe as printed and my cookies were flat - delicious - but flat. Also, do you recommend convection oven cooking? Please answer as I&#039;d like to make them again!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Carol in Sun Valley, Idaho]]></description>
