					<description><![CDATA[Was wondering what to do for dinner tonight when I came across this post - I went out to the herb pot on the deck &amp; picked basil for this recipe. I then made a chicken salad (chicken, walnuts, dried cherries) with this as the binder - delicious! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a mayo that&#039;s as good as homemade and better than Hellman&#039;s....Southern cooks swear by it.  It is good enough to eat straight from the jar with a spoon.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;It contains no sugar (just like regular homemade mayo doesn&#039;t--at least my recipe doesn&#039;t) and it PERFECT in every mayo way!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Dukes-Mayonnaise/dp/B0002BQLEG&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;For some reason their website isn&#039;t working right now....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tried this with some chicken salad (along with a little regular mayo), and it worked really nicely! The only thing I wish I could have done is made the basil slurry a little smoother. For some reason, my mini-prep Cuisinart just didn&#039;t want to behave and break down the basil to a totally smooth consistency. Still, the aioli tasted great--really fresh and bright--and I sort of liked the little flecks of basil that didn&#039;t quite puree. Thanks for sharing this, Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Yum!!  Another allioli to add to the list: this one sounds really superb and just the thing to bring some sunshine into northern garlic-less places.......&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;My friend Benito from Palma (yes, he always gets asked about what his parents were thinking) taught me his allioli recipe from Catalunya.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Smash a couple of large garlic cloves in a mortar and pestle with a large pinch of salt and gradually add olive oil, pounding and incorporating all the time.  I was skeptical, but it did turn into, well, a creamy, hot and overwhelmingly garlicky sauce for vegetables, fries and fish.  I will try it with basil!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Tony]]></description>
