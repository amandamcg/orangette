					<description><![CDATA[Just bought the chocolate to make the 2020 batches.  Pandemic, wild fires, political chaos, economic struggles; closer to home, son with a TBI, then I was struck by a car (we&#039;re both recovering).  We need this peppermint bark more than ever this year. Thank you, again, Molly. Happy holidays, may 2021 be a better year for everyone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just circling back to thank you again (I thanked you back in 2011 or so) and to note that I&#039;ve made these every year since 2008, save one. That particular holiday season, I plain forgot to make them and I sure did pay for it with cranky nieces/nephews. Such a crowdpleaser, this bark is! Happy holidays to you and your family.]]></description>
