					<description><![CDATA[I have done some research on the name DeLancey by study of Bourbon-Lancey France. Ancedius is derived form the naming. Also Ass has been a first name previous and directly from the Ancedius line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have more at www.AncientlyDeLancey.com , perhaps about page two or three, but it will take some time to organize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some time in France Lancy was spelled without the &quot;e&quot; and also without the &quot;y&quot; using the end as nscie ncie nsie and other variations, mostly through Lascie as of without the &quot;n&quot; also from Normandy france prior to 1066 as through the inquiries of the conquering of England through William a cousin to the family of some length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My find here was some time ago about your new restaurant  and firstly was about I think a couple of years ago, hope its still going strong. So today 10-24-2011 my search on yahoo was DeLancey Haunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Till Next Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Search David George DeLancey for President]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, I&#039;m a new reader. Just started reading your blog and am greatly enjoying your book.&lt;br /&gt;I also love the name &quot;Delancey,&quot; that you and your husband, Brandon, picked for the restaurant. Not sure if you knew this, but Delancey is also the name of a street in Philadelphia. By far my favorite street in the city even after having grown up there. It is a short-ish street, runs West to East only a few blocks, and is quietly tucked between the busier streets in the Center of Philadelphia. Old, tall houses lined with old, tall trees. Beautiful homes, wide and majestic, and signifying every cozy classic, old fashioned city life, east coast movie and image that comes when you think of that name.&lt;br /&gt;So I think of the restaurant, Delancey, way far out there on the west coast, the same wonderful feel-good homey things come to mind when I picture myself sitting at the kitchen in one of the old Philadelphia houses on Delancey street. How wonderful it would be to be apart of a dinner party there! I imagine that must be what it&#039;s like at your restaurant most nights. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just read your book, which I LOVED, and I am so excited to see you are opening a restaurant right in our neck of the woods.  How cool!  We live in Fremont/Wallingford, but as you know, it&#039;s not too far away.  Can&#039;t wait to try your brilliant creations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and that is a cool little tucked in retail spot in the neighborhood isn&#039;t it?  Is that where Gracewinds Perinatal used to be?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just found out that the pizza place opening down the street from my house (I live on NW 70th) will be owned/operated by you and your husband! I absolutely can&#039;t wait until it opens. You can count me in as a potential customer, that&#039;s for sure. Oh, and you&#039;ll be in *great* company - right next door to Honore Bakery, surely one of the best bakeries in town :)]]></description>
