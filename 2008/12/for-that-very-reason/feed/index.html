					<description><![CDATA[I should also mention that I enjoy a thicker cookie, so I rolled my dough to 3/4 inch. To keep the dough from being overworked, instead of rerolling  multiple times I roll the scaps into balls and press with my hand or bottom of a cup to make a round cookie. My final note after all my trials. Be sure to remove cookies when a you see a little brown on the edges but they&#039;re still quite light. Any browning on the bottom changes the taste of the cookie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I loved the taste so much I made them twice more this week to figure out how to conquer the crumble. I&#039;m now careful to spoon the flour gently into the measuring cup and then level. I also add 1T vanilla when I add the sugar. I&#039;ve tried freezing them, but the family had started eating them straight from the freezer! Just can&#039;t keep them in the house.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://orangette.net/2008/12/for-that-very-reason/#comment-44560&quot;&gt;Joanne Owens&lt;/a&gt;.

Joanne, I&#039;m sorry they were crumbly!  That&#039;s frustrating.  I started adding weight measurements to my recipes in 2011, but sadly, I wasn&#039;t doing them at the time I posted this recipe.  That said, in general, 1 cup of all-purpose flour weighs between 125 and 140 grams.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this recipe. While they were delicious, they were too dry and crumbly to serve at my party.  At first I thought it was because I used Land O Lakes instead of Lurpak, but after studying a great article comparing butters and their baking results (http://www.sfgate.com/recipes/article/When-Put-to-the-Test-Here-s-How-Butter-Brands-3236719.php) I know if anything the Lurpak would have made them flakier/dryer. So the problem was with my measurement of the flour. Without using a scale, it&#039;s easy to put too much flour into the measuring cup.  I will try these again because they&#039;re the taste I want, but if anyone can share their secrets for getting an accurate measure, I&#039;d welcome it.  Also, if I do buy a scale, how do I know what the weight should be if the recipe doesn&#039;t specify?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these yesterday with half the recipe. Still warm from the oven, they were lightly crisp on the outside but melt in your mouth. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;ll try warming them in the microwave the next time to see if that works.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are really incredible cookies and yet they are so simple.  I wondered about the salt as well, but I didn&#039;t miss it. I noticed that they bake up better and look better if you make them smaller.  I put them in standard-size cupcake papers and then in a tin to give away, so that they won&#039;t break because they really are a delicate cookie.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Also, I made the brown sugar candy.  Needless to say, it was very popular, although I about broke my arm trying to get the caramel to melt into the cream (when I added them together, the caramel got hard as a rock).  All worth it though.]]></description>
