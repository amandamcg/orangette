					<description><![CDATA[Late to this party, but I made the cake last week and I do think it is one of the greatest and simplest (and great in its simplicity) cakes ever. I served with whipped cream and it was splendid. I will make this again for sure. Thank you!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve made this twice now, and it&#039;s been a hit both times! I made it with bourbon, which also inspired me to try my first Old Fashioned. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have collected SO many recipes off the intertubes, and it is very rare for me to go back to the source (for good or ill) ... but in this case, I feel compelled. This recipe is a winner. I am already planning the next time I will make this, and the one I just made today is only half eaten.  Thanks a billion, this may be the best use of bourbon I have ever met, actually superior to the whiskey sour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was looking for a way to use up the bottles of Jack Daniels given to us over the years when I came across this recipe in my search. Thank you very much! Coincidentally, I made your banana cake recipe this weekend and it was declared a full 10, and the best cake ever. Many many thanks for that too. Best wishes!]]></description>
