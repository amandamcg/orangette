					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I always swear I am going to use a recipe from someone other than you or Deb (Smitten Kitchen&#039;s) but when it comes down to it, there&#039;s just no reason to. And every time I set out to find a new recipe for something I&#039;m craving, google just brings me back to one of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great dish. I accidentally omitted the garlic (and thought as I was making it, &quot;so odd there&#039;s no garlic in this recipe!&quot;), so I guess that means that next time it will be even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the amazing recipes, each and every one of them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hate to bring back posts from the dead, but its eggplant season so I was on the hunt for something to do with the purple globes that came nestled in my CSA box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed the recipe a bit just because I didn&#039;t have everything:&lt;br /&gt;- omitted the jalapeno, tumeric, ginger&lt;br /&gt;- added chickpeas in (too lazy to make a separate dish of chana masala but wanted the protein&lt;br /&gt;- 2% greek yogurt&lt;br /&gt;- and curry powder instead of garam masala.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was quite divine. I&#039;m thrilled to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok so - I really don&#039;t like eggplant.  I have tried many incarnations of eggplant recipies without sucess.  I continue to get eggplant in my CSA box so every summer I try, try again.  I made this without high hopes but it was delicious!!! I would actually consider buying eggplant just to make this!  You have never failed me Molly!!! THANK YOU!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this last night and OH MY, it is SOOOO fantastic! In fact, I highly encourage you to include more eggplant recipes on this blog. I can&#039;t get enough of it! My husband loved this recipe too, which says a lot since he &quot;doesn&#039;t like&quot; eggplant. Well, he&#039;s a total convert now!!&lt;/&gt;In addition to this one, I have been making a lot of your recipes and all have been amazing. What&#039;s even more amazing, though, is that I don&#039;t normally cook and yet I&#039;m eagerly reading your blog and actually cooking your food....and I am enjoying the process!! So, thank you. I am a devoted fan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly! Over the past two years I have been expanding my palate and sometimes it takes me a while to get used to things. After seeing this Indian frozen dinner made by Amy&#039;s organic in the freezer bin at work over and over again I decided I would try it even though it looked so strange. The flavors were so comforting and warm and I loved it! So when I saw your post on eggplant (which I have never eaten before) I made this dish and although I ate my whole plate I had to force it down. Is it possible that I could have picked out the most bitter eggplants in the world? And maybe I&#039;ll never like garam masala...but I am thankful for the experience. Keep posting!]]></description>
