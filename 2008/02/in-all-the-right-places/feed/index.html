					<description><![CDATA[I made this recipe for the first time mid September at my cousin&#039;s house and he and his partner raved about it . We are staying at my sister&#039;s this weekend and today my cousin requested this recipe again so I delivered! I made the dough this afternoon and at this very moment,  it&#039;s chilling in the fridge.  I can&#039;t wait to see their faces tomorrow when they take the first bite ! It&#039;s all about the little pleasures]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well I will be having lunch tomorrow at my cousin&#039;s for an early birthday celebration  ( mine is on the 16th ), so I volunteered to bake something for the occasion.  And since I&#039;ve been dying to try this recipe for ages I thought today is the day!  I made the dough this evening and put it in the fridge. Tomorrow I will retrieve it early , let it rise and proceed with the rest of the recipe.  Will report back]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[only one word comes to mind after baking these cinnamon roles: DELICIOUS! Thank you so much for making me discover such a lovely cinnamon role with cream cheese glaze (which blended perfectly with the taste of the cinnamon on the roles) recipe! It&#039;s my new favorite dessert (although eating it for breakfast or as a snack is excellent too)! Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I had asked a while ago whether freezing the dough would work, so when I made these back in February I made a full recipe of dough but only rolled out and filled half.  I froze the other half and only last week remembered it.  I thawed it in the fridge overnight, then continued on with the recipe (rolling, filling, etc).  It totally worked!  The only thing I would do differently next time is to give the dough a little time at room temp before I roll it out - the second rise took a bit longer with cold dough.  I&#039;m going to make these for my boyfriend&#039;s 9am thesis defense!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was a yeast virgin, and your amazing Cinnamon Buns broke it! I followed the recipe to a T, (which I never do by the way)cream cheese glaze and all and they turned out perfect. Despite the fact the first batch was slightly burned. Our ovens here in Argentina have only two temperatures. HOT and HOTTER!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these last month.  They were amazing. I also poured whipping cream over the cinnamon rolls before they baked.  This is a friend&#039;s secret for cinnamon rolls.  My neighbor thought they were fabulous too.  I will make them again soon!]]></description>
