					<description><![CDATA[I hope you are having a great time in Europe and come back rested and revived! I learned about you from my good friend, MichÃ¨le who took your wedding pics. New to your blog, but looking forward to keeping up with all the tips and tantalizing photos. MichÃ¨le mentioned you might like to see some of my food drawings (pizza, sushi, cupcakes, etc.) on my blog. Look forward to hearing about your trip.]]></description>
