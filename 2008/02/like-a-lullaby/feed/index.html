Nina, your comment made me happier than you can imagine! Your aunt was, and continues to be, a huge inspiration to me. I can&#039;t believe you found this post - and I&#039;m honored than you left a comment. Thank you! I&#039;m going to get out The Taste of Country Cooking and spend some extra time with it as your aunt&#039;s birthday approaches. I&#039;ll think of you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad that I happened upon this post, so many years after your original writing! I am Edna&#039;s niece Nina, who typed up the manuscript for the Taste of Country Cooking starting when I was about 12 years old. I still remember reading her words over and over, and typing them over and over! I used to read portions of the cookbook to my daughters when they were younger.  And, sadly, when my mother Naomi, Edna&#039;s baby sister (whom she raised after their mother died), was in the hospital in a coma for several months, I read much of the book out loud to her. It was very comforting to me (and hopefully to my mother) to read those stories and imagine their lives in Freetown. My mother did pass away, and Aunt Edna died the following year. It was heart breaking and I still miss them terribly.  Reading your post brought back so many wonderful memories of my Aunt Edna and all of her sisters and brothers.  Well, it is wonderful to hear that other people enjoy her memories as much as my family and I do! I think I will pick up the book and just read to myself in bed. And, by the way, Aunt Edna would be 100 years old this year - her birthday is April 13th - maybe we should do an Edna Lewis 100th Birthday read-a-thon! Enjoy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alexandra, I&#039;m sorry I couldn&#039;t reply sooner!  But just in case you see this and still have time, yes, I do think this cake is still great after a day or two. Let it cool fully, then wrap it in plastic wrap, and you should be good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also commenting seven years after the fact, but I hope you might still reply! I&#039;d like to bring a simple cake to work tomorrow as a birthday gift, but am concerned this cake won&#039;t be good after sitting for 19 hours. There&#039;s little chance you&#039;ll reply in the next two hours, of course, but just in case -- do you recomment against serving this cake after it&#039;s long cooled? ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It might seem weird to comment on something written 7 years ago but since I&#039;ve read through both of your books I&#039;ve taken to reading through old blog post as a way to unwind. Anyways this post made me do a little happy squeal the taste of country cooking is one if the first cookbooks I got myself as a teen and it inspired me to cook seasonally and locally. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This Edna Lewis cake has been my go-to cake for years on those days when I just need cake. Thank you! And this morning I was thinking about how I love the kid&#039;s picture book about Edna Lewis, &quot;Bring Me Some Apples and I&#039;ll Make You A Pie.&quot; Just thought I&#039;d pass on the book suggestion now that you&#039;ve got a little one. ]]></description>
