					<description><![CDATA[Just made this for the 3rd time after finding the version you included in Bon Appetite.  I kept pretty close to your instructions, including being a little too serious on allowing it to get some colour in the oven - may have gone a little overboard.  This time I made a double batch, tried a few different nuts and seeds, and swapped out half the oil for coconut oil.  My husband didn`t even wait for it to leave the pan before scooping some up for desert.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this recipe.&lt;br /&gt;Lisa]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been reading your blog for the past few years, but this is by far the post I come back to time and again. Your daily granola has become my daily granola, too! I love the way my whole house smells of ginger and cinnamon when I&#039;m baking up a batch. So thank you for sharing all your recipes (but this one in particular!)]]></description>
