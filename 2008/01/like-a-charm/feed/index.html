					<description><![CDATA[I had a GREAT parsley pesto recipe.  The key, which could be shared with any such recipe, was to add some browned, crumbled, hot italian sausage to the final mix.  Serve on hot pasta, YUM!&lt;/&gt;The pesto alone is just kind of green stuff, but add the sausage and the compliments are complimentary!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know I&#039;m way late on this way, but say parsley and I think salsa verde! (Italian kind, not Mexican kind) Parsley, anchovies, capers, garlic, olive oil. Mmmm! And I second the Chimichurri idea... more garlic and olive oil, plus cilantro and cumin. So good!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had been meaning to make this pesto ever since seeing your post (I almost went out that night and picked up the few things I&#039;d need) and a few weeks ago I finally got to it, quite by accident. My boyfriend, our good friend and I (both of them are prior chefs in the Boston area, from some of better restaurants to have made the Boston food scene... I am totally spoiled, yes I know) had spent the day sipping espresso, shopping for a new stove (!) for me and discovering the wonderful produce, cheese and other yummies at Russo&#039;s, a local market in the Boston area. We found ourselves back at my place, hungry and without any real plans. I remembered your recipe and had just bought a fresh bunch of parsley, but we had no almonds... though there were hazelnuts. So I set them to the task and we created a pizza with parsley-hazelnut pesto, Italian Mountain Cheese (From Trader Joe&#039;s), Smoked Gouda, shrimp and prosciutto. YUM! AND I&#039;ve been enjoying the rest of the pesto on pasta since then. So, all that is to say- thank you for the inspiration and proving to my chef-friends that pesto doesn&#039;t always have to mean basil and pine nuts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of a sauce I had in Nice called persillade, which is runnier than a pesto and didn&#039;t have almonds.  Basically, it is lots of parsley, garlic, &amp; olive oil, pureed.  If you want, you can add parmesan, chile flakes, lemon and/or anchovies.  Drizzle it over pizza or saute with mussels/clams/prawns/calamari, or  tossed with pomme frites - yum.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow - pesto w/o pine nuts. I need to try that because I am alergic to tree nuts(including pine nuts) and therefor I have NEVER tried pesto. And something not commonly know - almonds are not nuts  - they are a part of the fruit family - peaches and cheeries. Pesto is always something I have been dyeing to try and now I can!! Thank you!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are so right in that the weather here in Seattle is off to sort a great start. Today in West Seattle, it is very nice out and as yours, my italian parsley is booming! I have made parsley pesto with great success. I also make a nage(broth) as well to accompany fish or vegetable dishes. Hand chop parsley leaves, reduce some vegetable or chicken stock with shallots, mushroom stems, vermouth, and parsley stems. Reduce by half. Strain, and then whisk in the parsley leaves, minced preserved lemon, butter and evoo. Season. Great with steamed or poached fish, gnocchi etc. It&#039;s use in pasta doughs works well also. Time to pick some rosemary blossoms for that tea of yours. check out my blog when you can...cuisinierskitchen.blogspot.com &lt;/&gt;cuisinier]]></description>
