					<description><![CDATA[Molly,  I was in a panic this evening as I knew I wanted to make this black bean recipe, it&#039;s been a favorite since I discovered it a few weeks ago, and I couldn&#039;t remember whose recipe it was.  What a big relief when I remembered it was you!  Thank you so much for this oh so easy contribution to my repertoire that is enjoyed by my husband and two young children.   Thanks for finding the time as a busy mama of June to share with us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;d be up for trying this recipe again, but the amount of cornstarch in the recipe is an error. It is supposed to be 4 tbsp, not 5. I imagine this would make a big difference.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made the black beans, with a few substitutions -- instead of hot sauce, I used 1/4 tsp ground chipotle chili (a little smoky) and 1/4 tsp Old Bay Seasoning (I omitted the salt because Old Bay has salt), and 1/4 tsp garlic powder for the fresh garlic (since I have no garlic press, and also it seemed like the garlic would stay a bit raw).  Made brown rice, and a sliced tomato salad, and that&#039;s a very easy, quick, and tasty meal!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these for the first time for supper tonight, and made some brown rice with a bit of salsa added, and it was FABULOUS!  Thank you for the recipe, a great quick and easy veggie meal!  Your blog is the best and I&#039;m glad I found it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this recipe! Last time I made it I doubled it and then added a can of Trader Joe&#039;s pureed sweet potatoes. I eat it on flour tortillas with Trader Joe&#039;s peach salsa on the side. Perfect lunch for me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These look great and tasty. Question: do you use canned black beans or black bean soup (in the red can, at least for Goya)? The soup version is already nicely spiced, fairly garlicy. A great way to doctor a can of black bean soup is to cook rice in it (as opposed to water or broth), adding water ONLY if necessary, and you get a lovely Cuban-style rice and beans dish called &#039;Moro&#039; that way.]]></description>
