					<description><![CDATA[I was looking around for recipes for hot chocolate drink and I chanced upon your blog. Your recipe sounds good! To me, nothing beats having a mug of hot chocolate in hand, sitting on the coach on a rainy day. Cheers! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, it&#039;s perfect. I&#039;ve never made hot chocolate from scratch before, I must admit. French breakfast is the best in the world in my opinion and hot chocolate, so thick it&#039;s almost a pudding, is essential.&lt;br /&gt;I live in Vienna and today is the first real day of winter - it is snowing outside, christmas music on the radio.&lt;br /&gt;I used Lindt&#039;s mild 70% chocolate and added a cinnamon stick and a pinch of chilli pepper and now I&#039;m the happiest person. Ever. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Delicious! The best recipe I&#039;ve found and it does in fact taste like the hot chocolate at Laduree. I wish I could drink it in the same ambience though. Just make sure that one you&#039;re boiling the milk you continuously stir it because I stopped stirring it for a second and it boiled over. Thank you for this delicious recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[decade diary, I&#039;ve never tried this recipe with cocoa, but I have a feeling that it would be very, very different.  The chocolate is what gives this recipe its richness and body, and without it, I think you&#039;ll just have standard hot cocoa.  I think I&#039;d wait until I had some chocolate on hand, if I were you.  Happy weekend!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This recipe looks delicious, I can&#039;t wait to try it out. I especially like your method of blending to froth it up. I was just wondering, since I don&#039;t have chocolate on hand at the moment, could I substitute cocoa instead of the chocolate? If so, how much would you recommend I use?]]></description>
