					<description><![CDATA[Thankyou for such a lovely recipe! I have made these several times now and never fail butterscotchy goodness!
For those who are interested - after the first time I made this, I swapped out demera for plain old raw sugar. I&#039;m in Australia, demera is $4.99 for 180g - and hard to find, while plain old raw sugar costs around $2.99 for a 2kg bag - and I can&#039;t differentiate in taste with the finished product. I have swapped out the muscavado once for &#039;dark&#039; brown sugar - and it wasn&#039;t nearly as good. Definitely hunt down muscovado, its worth it! I have my 9th batch chilling in the fridge now. Bring on dessert!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly. These took way longer than 40 minutes to set up for me in the oven. I finally cranked the heat a bit. They were crazy delish though, although I accidently over salted because i only had course sea salt.  All in all though, super yummy!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!!&lt;br /&gt;Gillian]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m new to cooking and have a question regarding the step where you put the towel and ramekins into the baking dish.  Would you recommend a glass or metal baking pan?  And, to clarify, you leave the dish towel into the pan and so when you pour the hot water in, you are soaking the towel?  I&#039;m afraid the baking the towel in the oven will start a fire mishap, so just wanted to make sure I had the step right before I tried it.  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These sounds wonderful!  I&#039;ve been wanting to buy Demerara every since I read some &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Skin-Folk-Nalo-Hopkinson/dp/0446678031/ref=pd_bbs_sr_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1226974548&amp;sr=8-5&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;short stories by Nalo Hopkinson&lt;&gt;, but it would take up quite a bit of room for something I&#039;d occasionally put in tea.  Now I have a proper reason.  *g*&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;ve been reading through your back catalog (can&#039;t remember whether I&#039;ve commented and said hello, yet), and I very much love the way you eat - I only wish I had the knack of baking.  But Pots de Crème have been on my list of things that seem within my grasp.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I think this is the second time, though, that I have noticed you having trouble gauging color in a dark pan.  Perhaps you have discovered the secret by now, but if not I have a helpful hint.  I just every now and then dip a teaspoon into the liquid so that I have a bright background on which to see the color.  No need to buy new pans.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I finally made this today.  It&#039;s been sitting on my counter for a while now waiting to be made.  It was so velvety and the perfect shade of butterscotch.  I could hardly wait for it to cool.  Thank you for sharing such a lovely recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I love your blog and have for years.  I just want to say that I first made these pots de creme three years ago and I think they are one of the main reasons my boyfriend loves me as much as he does.  Every time I make them I win a few more hearts.  I&#039;m so happy that they are favorites of yours now too!]]></description>
