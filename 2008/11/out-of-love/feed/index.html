					<description><![CDATA[I got a savoy cabbage in my weekly fruit &amp; veggie delivery box and had no idea what to do with it.  After googling recipes, I came across this wonderful blog! Made it on a cold Friday night and it turned out beautifully.  Thanks for posting such a unique recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made this (found your blog through a link when searching for savoy cabbage recipes, since I had 3/4 of a head leftover from some coleslaw I had made).  I don&#039;t even really like cabbage, but I cannot believe how wonderful this was; we had it with grilled pork chops.  Will definitely be making it again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Orangette, having just read your now famous cabbage gratin recipe (I read about it in the Times in London) I can see why its such a big hit. Like you I&#039;m a fan of greens and slow braising and have just blogged a Leeks in Oyster recipe to that end. maybe you might want to take a look when you have a minute!&lt;br /&gt;kind regards&lt;br /&gt;jo]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sounds lovely and inspires me to try some savoyed cabbage in the garden. &lt;br /&gt;I&#039;ve always shied away from it, for the same reasons you look askance - at one time it must surely have sat in a grubby pot, in back of the The Little Shop Of Horrors.&lt;br /&gt;But any roasted/braised gabbage dish with scallions, and triple cream cheese must surely be something worth waxing poetic over!&lt;br /&gt;(Wish I could say the same for our new president)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, O.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We enjoyed this for several days...so satisfying! I experimented with plain ole cabbage to see how it would work.  Trust me, just stick with the Savoy -- the texture made a big difference, plus plain cabbage was too watery.  I&#039;ll bet Napa cabbage could work if you didn&#039;t use the watery core and spines.  I also experimented using white wine since I only had half a cup of ch. Stock in the freezer.  Not a good idea.  Thanks for the recipe!]]></description>
