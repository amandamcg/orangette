					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I&#039;m making this today with dried fava beans, small diced potato, and fennel. We&#039;ll see how it goes (just trying to use what&#039;s in the fridge!). But I was wondering if this recipe somehow missed getting on your recipe site? I was searching for it and couldn&#039;t find it. Just thought you&#039;d want to know, in case you forgot to add it. (otherwise, I&#039;m blind.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These were delicious if not addicting.  I made them as a side to a beautiful steak house style dinner.  I let everyone else feast on the rest of the meal and I enjoyed the Lima Beans in Cream as my appetizer, meal and dessert!  Thank You!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I LOVE lima beans and have been eating them a lot lately as they have really good organic (albeit frozen)ones at my local food co-op. I am trying these highly underrated legumes in cream the first chance I get, thanks for the excellent idea! Patricia]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah.........these were insane.  I have not made lima beans for years because I have a mildly picky husband, but when I saw your photo I said &quot;You&#039;re trying lima beans!&quot;  They were amazing.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.  Also, I would just like to throw in that I&#039;ve also made your recent Bon Apetit recipes for leek confit and pomodori al forno. (Hope I got that right...)Unbelievably delicious.  My 13 year old gastronome-in-training comes home from school and has French bread with capricho de cabra and leek confit for a snack.  Lucky kid, yes?  Thanks again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;/&gt;I am a frequent reader of your blog, but have never posted before.&lt;/&gt; &lt;/&gt;Last month I was lucky enough to eat at Watershed in Decatur, GA where I ordered the hot vegetable plate. The most perfect item on a lovely plate of amazing veggies was a pile of lima beans (or as we call them in the south, butter beans) cooked in cream. I am so thrilled to have the recipe in hand while I can still get fresh butter beans at my local farmer&#039;s market. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
