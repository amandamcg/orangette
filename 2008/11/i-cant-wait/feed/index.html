					<description><![CDATA[Since Brandon had Dominic DeMarco&#039;s (DiFara Pizza) frequent masterpieces so often he must have that supreme example of pizza engrained somewhere in his mind (tastebuds?) as a pinnacle to strive for. I too, am one of the faithful. Congratulations and good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know I&#039;m late to this conversation, but I just stumbled across your blog while searching for a recipe for Mararoons.  I made yours, by the way - and they were a BIG HIT!  I love your site and your recipes and want to congratulate you on all of the wonderful things that are going on in your life.  Also, I have to let you know that your brother owns the BEST restaurants in DC!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations to Both of you !!! IT&#039;s amazing to read the story about Brandon&#039;s transition from what he was taught and trained. For me it&#039;s not... I had the same thing but the transition was still in the Art world. Just that it&#039;s in different line. I was asked many times to open a small eatery outlet or cafeteria but I prefer to be the one who eats than cooks :-D&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Don&#039;t worry though... Everything will fall right in for you all. Just relax and take it easy. My best wishes and Happy NEw YEar 2009!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Do keep us posted with the development ok? :-)]]></description>
