					<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t sure where to put this post, so I hope you find it here...I just made your Green Papaya salad recipe from Bon Appetit (May 2010)--but I substituted raw kohlrabi for the papaya.  Wow!  So yummy!  And much easier to find here in the Northeast.  I might add a bit of lime zest next time since papaya is more tart than the kohlrabi--but then again, I might leave it exactly the way it is!  Thanks for a lovely, light &quot;almost summer I can feel it&quot; dinner.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess there must be endless variations on dressings for the kohlrabi-carrot julienne salad. The version I make (from a BBC cooking show but I forget which) calls for mustard and cumin seeds to be fried in hot oil til they sputter. The mix is then poured on the julienned carrots and kohlrabi (half of which would have already been devoured as a snack during the prep). Add lemon juice. Toss. Eat. Or if you have enough patience, refrigerate about half an hour and reap the rewards of your patience (the flavors reach another dimension). Try a &quot;slaw&quot; version with plain/Greek yogurt. Or try it with shredded white cabbage...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey -- &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Just made this tonight, and I&#039;m kind of conflicted. On the one hand, I found the fennel with the sesame oil to be kind of a bizarre combination. On the other hand, I did find it kind of addictive. Would like to make this again with a higher carrot to kohlrabi ratio, and with toasted cumin seeds instead of fennel... But it was nice to eat something fresh tasting in the winter... &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Love your blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had this planned for dinner with an Asian marinated skirt skirt steak and bok choy.  It didn&#039;t make it.  I had a plate to taste on its own.  Now, for my second plate I&#039;m having it with no-kead rye toast and butter.  Half of the bowl is now gone.]]></description>
