					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Molly, these were so heavenly! Way better than any other stuffed tomatoes I&#039;ve had. The long roasting time makes them so sweet and  flavourful. I used large heirloom tomatoes from the farmers market, added white wine instead of water, and some grated sheep cheese on top. Served it with a mizuna and pear salad. Perfect, fresh and comforting, mmm.]]></description>
