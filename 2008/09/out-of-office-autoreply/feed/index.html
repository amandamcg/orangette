					<description><![CDATA[oh, wow. These were soooooooo good - we had them with little toasted french bread stick slices and persian feta, and when they were gone we took the rest of the fresh bread stick and gorged ourselves, mopping up the oil pooled on our plates. The oil was amazing!! The tomatoes are all gone now, but I still have the leftover oil saved in a jar for more bread-dipping-gorging action.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Also made your skillet potatoes - mmmm, delicious - they&#039;re going to be my new summer potato salad. (I&#039;m in Australia, see, and so am stockpiling these handy recipes for my forthcoming season of picnics)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly-&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;These wonderful tomatoes accompanied a huge lobster dinner this past weekend in a little house on Cliff Island, about 15 miles off the coast of Portland, Maine. They were a huge hit! I used a mix of yellow and red tomatoes, and fresh oregano that I dried myself. I&#039;m looking forward to cooking from your site even more.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely loved these tomatoes, as in groan-worthy, ditched the rest of the planned dinner just to gorge myself.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Also, m&#039;dear, I&#039;m starting a blog myself, to keep everyone updated on my travels this year, and was wondering if you&#039;d mind if I linked up to yours, since all I&#039;ve been doing to prepare myself for being away from the kitchen is make your recipes. ;)  Please let me know if that&#039;s a problem!  Have a look, if you have a moment: bittersweetfeast.blogspot.com&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Can&#039;t wait to hear about your adventures!]]></description>
