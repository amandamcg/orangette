					<description><![CDATA[Happy Birthday, Molly. I hope somebody gave you a copy of &quot;29 &amp; Counting: A chick&#039;s Guide to Turning 30,&quot; (because I wrote it!), because it will confirm what you already suspect: your &#039;30s are all good. You&#039;re happily married, write a successful blog, have a column in a big glossy magazine...and you still, judging from your photo, look all of 23! What more could you want? And it will only get better. I&#039;m in my mid &#039;40s now. Trust me, child...&lt;/&gt;Congrats!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Red shoes, yes!!!  I have loved to death my red clogs - and I&#039;m not a red-wearing person (it doesn&#039;t go well right next to my face).  Red high heels are just so much more exciting than clogs, too.  Much more likely to be appreciated by the husband ;D  And, that particular brand makes some awfully tempting styles, too.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m a month or so from 31, and I must say I do NOT miss my 20&#039;s.  Like many said before, life just gets easier, money, jobs, love - it all makes more sense.]]></description>
