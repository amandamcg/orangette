					<description><![CDATA[AMS is my favorite European city.  Another fun fact - it has more museums per capita than any other city in Europe! About those bicycles - ratty and old may be chic in some circles, but Dutch drunks make a habit of throwing bicycles in the canals.  They have to dredge them every spring to keep the bicycle:water ratio down to a reasonable level.  This is according to my grumpy Dutch cousin, so . . . go figure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At the risk of revealing my inner history dork: when I was in Amsterdam I read somewhere that during WWII the Nazi army confiscated the majority of the bicycles in the city.  The bikes that survived were considered treasures, which is why you see so many old, ratty bikes on the streets there.  The older, the better!  Fun fact, eh?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ah, the bicycles of amsterdam.  apparently there&#039;s a lot of bike theft and people buy old, worn ones, so they&#039;re not too upset if it&#039;s stolen.  but, i agree, they are wonderful and i would be utterly heartbroken...]]></description>
