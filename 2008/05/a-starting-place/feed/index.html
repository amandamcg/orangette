					<description><![CDATA[Well I don&#039;t want to be the only one who didn&#039;t pre-order your book - so I&#039;m off to do so right now - and congrats!  Having a book published is cause for major celebration so I hope you&#039;ve got something special planned! When my first book was published my friends threw me a surprise party - one of the best days of my life!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh guys.  I&#039;m so sorry for not responding to your comments sooner!  Eeesh.  I can&#039;t thank you enough for all the good cheer around my book.  YOU ARE THE BEST.  The absolute best.  It makes me so happy to know that you&#039;re as excited about it as I am.  Thank you, thank you.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Maiapapaya, since I wrote this post, Brandon and I have tried the dressing on Belgian endive, and it&#039;s delicious!  I love the sound of your salad, with the boiled eggs and avocado...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Alice Q., I hear you.  Loud and clear.  I LOVED Nate!  (Until the last season, when he kept doing stupid things.)  What a handsome, handsome, lovely man.  Ahhh.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks for the heads-up, Nikki!  I&#039;ll keep an eye out...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nightquill, you&#039;re awesome.  I had a good chuckle at that.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks, Dirty Mistress and Lauren!  Your comments made me feel much better.  And really, Foraged and Found is a great little company, so though the possibilities freak me out, I still have to assume that they would take a lot of care with what they sell.   You know?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Megan, I hadn&#039;t even noticed that!  (Clearly, I was only seeing the words &quot;infestation,&quot; &quot;necrotic,&quot; and &quot;flukes.&quot;) But you&#039;re so right.  What&#039;s with all the widow stuff?  Really weird.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Trish, I&#039;m so glad you&#039;re liking the Polaroids!  I&#039;ve been playing around with film a lot lately - using both a Polaroid and a Pentax K1000 - and I&#039;m &lt;&gt;loving&lt;&gt; it.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Katie, I bought that bag in Brussels, I&#039;m afraid - not Paris.  So sorry!  It came from a little health food store called Shanti, in the Ixelles area.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I take all the photos here, Veronica.  Thanks for the sweet words about them!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Rachel, I&#039;m honored that you would want to link to Orangette!  You don&#039;t even have to ask.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Alyxx, there will DEFINITELY be a party / book event of some sort in Seattle next spring!  For sure.  Maybe even two of them, in fact..  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Zoe, I have been reading about your book all over the place lately!  What a pleasure to see your name pop up here.  Thank you so much for stopping by - and congratulations on your book&#039;s success!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Neen, I&#039;ll see if I can pull some strings for you...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the dressing -- at some point I would love to hear Brendon&#039;s mental process, how he figured it out. Salad dressings scare me like some folks are scared of yeast or whisking mayo; they require a level of creativity and cosmic science and luck that I just can&#039;t master. So hearing how one of those gifted few think about it would be super useful. :) Just a thought :)]]></description>
