					<description><![CDATA[I made this dish tonight, even though it is near the end of August! I am trying to use up a bumper crop of onions before they start going bad. I had some dried spaetzle in the pantry so I thought I would use that. There was a recipe on the package that was basically the same as this only it was baked and called for swiss cheese. I had a chunk of a really nice gruyere in the fridge so that&#039;s what I used. Oh. My. God! It is really, really, really good! Thanks for a great recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I must have had this post knocking around in my head for months, because I just saw an edition of Beard on Pasta at the Strand the yesterday and it all came flooding back. I bought the book and read it immediately--it is just so sweet and hopeful. Gives me dreams of lazy sweet late spring days and winter afternoons, once this hell-hole of obligations passes a little. Come visit anytime, Molly, you clearly know how to host and be a houseguest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Finally got around to making this tonight, with a side of roasted butternut squash (with garlic and allspice) and stirfried swiss chard.&lt;/&gt;Well, good Lord, but I did wait to long to have it!  &lt;/&gt;I kept sneaking bites as I was putting away the leftovers, which is always a good/bad sign.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This pasta sauce is so tasty.  I made it for dinner two nights ago and have been eating the buttery leftovers for my lunches.  It&#039;ll have to be a rare treat for me, but I do love this.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m completely in love with your writing and your blog as well and have just subscribed to Bon Appetit because I heard of your article.  Yours is the first blog I ever stumbled across and I have loved reading about your life and love of food.  I&#039;ve also secured for myself a copy of your cookbook and I just can&#039;t wait to get my hands on it!  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oops - I think I may have just revealed myself as a bit of an Orangette fanatic.  Don&#039;t think me crazy...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I made this recipe over the weekend and loved it - except for the over-the-top richness.  I may try it again with half as much butter.  Thanks for your delicious descriptions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly;&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I also came upon your column in Bon Appetit and was at once drawn to you as a kindred soul... I grew up admiring Julia and James- and used their books as my first bibles along with the Joy of Cooking,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I am having the onions with white wine and Vidalias- and trying 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter- &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thank you for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Orangette! Greetings from Orange, California. We are having the craziest weather (tornadoes, hail, floods, snow, in MAY! in CALIFORNIA!). This recipe is perfect for a cozy night spent figuring out how to relight the pilot on the gas heater, thanks!]]></description>
