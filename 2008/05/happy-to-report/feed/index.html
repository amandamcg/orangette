					<description><![CDATA[I tried this out but instead I used morel mushrooms, they&#039;re a personal favorite of mine, truly the &quot;queen of the forest&quot;. I definately was suprised with ones I ordered from what usually is a great place to order seafood but instead this time I ordered the mushrooms. It was quite a treat and I urge anyone else to try this recipe with morel mushrooms also, if not any of the other selections from this place: www.jdseafoodexpress.com&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;They really do have great food, delivered right to your door so it is very convenient and inexpensive but my favorite part is how fresh it is!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tried this last night, now need a dozen or so recipes just like it.  I&#039;m trying to learn to cook from ingredients, based on what&#039;s in season and available locally.  From now on, whenever I spot good mushrooms at the farmer&#039;s market, I&#039;ll know exactly what to do with them!  I just love any recipe that uses things I probably have on hand, and doesn&#039;t involve a special run to the store for 10 more ingredients.]]></description>
