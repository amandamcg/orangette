					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t tried Gordon&#039;s cup yet, but it reads like something I&#039;d like.&lt;/&gt;Reminds me  of a Pimm&#039;s Cup, which if I remember correctly needed a special kind of gin called Pimm&#039;s Cup which I think had a spice and fruit flavoring ... I haven&#039;t had it in years, though. This seems much lighter in taste.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good lord.  Did I not reply to a single comment last week?  I am the worst.  I think I fell into a hole or something.  And I am not yet sure that I have reemerged.  But anyway, a couple of quick replies, because you guys are so good to me:&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;To all who suggested Hendricks, thank you!  I really, really need to try that stuff.  It&#039;s next on my list.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Rebekka, that jam recipe works beautifully with strawberries.  I&#039;ve done it many, many times.  In place of the berries, just use two pounds of strawberries, and otherwise, follow the directions as written.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Joy of Cooking, I&#039;m not sure how I feel about Campari.  I&#039;ve only had it in a Negroni - one of my mother&#039;s favorite drinks - and I didn&#039;t like that at all.  But I should maybe try it on its own, huh?  With soda?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Camden, that is the loveliest, &lt;&gt;loveliest&lt;&gt; quote!  Thank you so much for sharing it with me.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And to all who asked about or commented on my Polaroids, thank you!  I didn&#039;t mean to switch over to Polaroid entirely here; it just sort of happened.  Many years ago, my dad gave me his old SX-70, and I pulled it out a couple of months ago to try playing with it, only to find that it was broken.  I took it to a camera shop to have it looked at, and instead of having it fixed - too expensive for my blood - I bought a cheapo Polaroid Spectra instead.  And I fell head-over-heels in love.  (I also bought a Pentax K1000 film camera, which I have been loving too.  Hopefully I&#039;ll be posting some photos from it here soon.)  I absolutely adore the look of film and the way it captures light and color.  And I love the element of chance that comes with it, too - that feeling of anticipation as I wait to see if my shot turned out. I have hardly touched my digital camera since I started using film!  The poor thing looks kind of lonely.  I have no doubt that I&#039;ll get back to using it, but as long as my supply of Polaroid film holds out, that&#039;s what I&#039;ll reach for first.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly,&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I&#039;m absolutely over the moon in love, head-over-heels you might say, with your blog; you bring simple food to life with your well-chosen words and elegant pictures. One of my favorite posts, or series of posts, was describing your wedding, and I have to say that I wish you and Brandon all the best in your life together. I was reading from the gathered works of M.F.K. Fisher and in one of her short stories she cited this quote from Richardson Wright that I knew I should share with you from the moment I read it, and so here goes: &quot;I am convinced that a man and wife with congenial appetites and a knowledge  of foods and cooking have the basis for lasting happiness&quot;.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I hope you get the chance to read this. May your love of food and love of love always bring you happiness.]]></description>
