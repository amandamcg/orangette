					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back! I&#039;m going to Paris for a few days in June/July...can&#039;t wait!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I made a variation on your granola...I had been looking to make some for a while, and your recipe is by far the easiest I&#039;ve seen. I used sliced instead of chopped almonds, omitted the granulated sugar, sadly had to omit the coconut(didn&#039;t have any), and added a little flax seed and wheat germ for a nutritional boost. Oh, and used 70% dark chocolate (it&#039;s what I had on hand). &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I had hoped that it would be around for the rest of the week, but after tasting it, I&#039;m not so sure. Thanks! Love your blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi! It&#039;s my first time posting, but it seems like the right time now. I&#039;m in the Netherlands right now, visiting family, and head to Paris on Wednesday. Is it not the most amazing city?! I love it, and this will be the first time my husband and I visit together. So romantic!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Also, I read your mayo article on the way over to Europe. I think my mom and I will try it this week. I&#039;d run across your blog before, but now that I&#039;ve made the Bon Appetit connection I think I&#039;m here for good. Good luck with the jet lag!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Of course we&#039;re still here! I&#039;ve been checking compulsively to see when you&#039;re back. Can&#039;t wait to hear about Paris.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;This is my first time commenting. I discovered your blog about a month ago and have been reading through your archives every chance I get. I love the way that in writing about food you write about so much more, but with a beautifully light touch. Very inspiring.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Nous sommes heureux d&#039;entendre votre &quot;voix&quot; de nouveau!&lt;/&gt;(I hope that&#039;s right; I&#039;m a little rusty.)&lt;/&gt;Alison&lt;/&gt;findtruenorth.typepad.com]]></description>
