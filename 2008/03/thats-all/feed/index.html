					<description><![CDATA[Mmm, I&#039;ve never been to Brussels, but I have been pretty obsessed with waffles for a while now. There&#039;s a tiny little shop in Chicago that makes the &quot;good&quot; kind of waffles, with pearl sugar, just as you described, and ever since I tried them, I&#039;ve been trying to make them. I&#039;m still not there, but it sure has been fun trying. One day I hope to find a good deal and a few willing friends and make the pilgrimage to the waffle holy land. Thank you for sharing your trip with us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had a sweet crepe marocaine with honey and a creamy white something. With a cup of mint tea. At the midi market, at a stand that sells olives and stuff. So yeah, I know what you&#039;re talking about.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;... I can&#039;t wait till next week ! (cause you could probably make them yourself, but it just ain&#039;t got the charm). Off to a luxurious lunch of salty flat bread, strawberries and cheese that just must be illegal in the US. Mmmmmh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post- those yeasted waffles sound very similar to a simple yeasted waffle recipe I use from the fannie farmer cookbook (minus the pearl sugar) -- the most light and airy waffles I&#039;ve ever had.  Perhaps you could recreate them and give us a recipe on your next post?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had to come up with a Moroccan Crepe recipe after I read the first reference to it on the blog.  I just happen to have some harissa that my Mother In Law had sent me from Williams Sonoma.  She is a really nice Mother In Law I might add!  Anyway, I marinated some green olives in the harissa, then heated up a tortilla (not in the mood to whip up crepes), and sprinkled some goat cheese, drizzled with honey. The harissa, honey  and goat cheese was just the right combination of sweet, spicy, and salty.   Yum! Oh my, this was such a tasty combination that I fixed them for myself for dinner as well.  I am going to try this with guests with the homemade crepes, and I imagine that these will be the hit of the evening.  I enjoy your blog!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Amanda in Seattle]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, how lovely!  I&#039;ve been wanting to get to Belgium for a long time now and haven&#039;t managed it.  I have wondered, though, if the dialect is similar to France-French... I&#039;m fairly fluent in French but I&#039;m afraid of an experience like arriving in the German-speaking part of Switzerland and realising &lt;&gt;this is not the same language&lt;&gt;.  Everyone has been posting about waffles lately!  I miss French &lt;&gt;gauffres&lt;&gt;, I really do.  Yeah, they&#039;re the Brussels kind, but smothered in melted cheese and herbs and I&#039;m a happy girl.]]></description>
