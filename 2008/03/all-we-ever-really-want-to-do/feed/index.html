					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much Molly! I know I can always count on your blog when I&#039;m out of good ideas. Your Daily Granola has become a staple here and my husband loves it. I&#039;m always trying out different combinations of seeds/nuts (cashews, walnuts, linseed etc), sweeteners (maple syrup, date molasses are a few) and dried fruits. And every time he goes off to work (he works in the Middle East while I live in France), I give him a bag of the stuff to take along with him.&lt;br /&gt;But last week my husband was thinking back at his University days and suddenly started longing for this &quot;mmmmmm delicious mmmmm *slurp*&quot; chocolate granola (his onomatopoeia) that he used to have as a student. Although it was incredibly overpriced for a tiny box (Luxury Granola by Alpen), he used to dig into his student budget to buy two boxes of the stuff every week. &lt;br /&gt;Now I wasn&#039;t one to let a big-name brand cereal take on my wholesome, Orangette-blog based, homemade goodness, so I had to decide on a plan of action, considering that I only had a Google image picture of the front of the cereal box to go by (no ingredient list). Your chocolate granola recipe came to mind instantly. I swapped the almonds for toasted hazelnuts, because the Google picture showed hazelnuts on the front of the box and because chocolate and hazelnuts are a match made in heaven. Followed the rest exactly as you wrote it out and ta-da! He loves it! Homemade 1 - commercial brand 0!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again Molly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aisha]]></description>
