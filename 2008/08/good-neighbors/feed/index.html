					<description><![CDATA[thanks for the recipe. Not having the good fortune of free blackberries at the backyard, I made a version of this with frozen mixed berries based on your recipe. it&#039;s still very delicious! I can understand why you churn batch after batch of this. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a rude woman your neighbor was. I was going to say that I hope she was forcibly moved to the Norse Home, or Ida Culver, or some other assisted living facility, but that would be unkind (not to mention how miserable it would be for her unsuspecting fellow residents). And, rough on the family that had to move her!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Your recipe sounds great, Molly. I might have to try and pick some of my own blackberries, tho they should still be selling them at the farmer&#039;s market on Sunday. And if they have no Skagit valley berries, there will be nice Yakima valley peaches and nectarines. Actually, I&#039;m craving fresh off-the-tree apples already, which indicates that my body believes that fall is here. It usually doesn&#039;t do that until football season starts, but if it means an early apple pie or pan-dowdy, so be it!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And FYI, I agree that our short WA summer is over. Last night, I came home and made a tuna casserole!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, come move in next to me, I&#039;ll plant berry bushes galore for you if you&#039;ll share your delicious scones!  I haven&#039;t made a single recipe yet that you&#039;ve recommended that hasn&#039;t been exquisite.  You should have given her a scone, she&#039;d probably tell you to pick them anytime so long as you share ;)]]></description>
