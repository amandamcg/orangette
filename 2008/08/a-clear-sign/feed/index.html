					<description><![CDATA[I spent the holidays on my own as I tested positive  ( yey covid! ) so I&#039;ve been waking up very , very early these days . I found myself in the kitchen this morning when the light was still blue ,with 3 ripe bananas and an hour later a wonderful banana bread . I went back to bed by 6 am and had a bowl of your chocolate granola with whole milk . Thank you for making me feel less alone and well fed  . I hope that this craziness will subside soon . Happy holidays Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to say that this banana bread is still very, very good in 2020 (especially with toasted walnuts mixed in).  It&#039;s kept me busy and well-fed during The Great Social Distancing, and for that I am exceedingly grateful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, this bread is great!  I&#039;ve made it twice now, (my dog ate the first loaf) and both times added frozen blueberries and toasted walnuts. I also baked it in a Pyrex cake round instead of a loaf pan since my loaf pan cracked in the oven. The bread was excellent and I&#039;m sure my dog would agree! Thanks for the recipe!]]></description>
