					<description><![CDATA[I bought fingerling potatoes on sale at the grocery store, and then came here knowing you&#039;d have just the recipe. And you did. &lt;/&gt;These turned out wonderfully even though I didn&#039;t peel them. And you&#039;re right - they&#039;re excellent room temperature, hot, or cold with extra salt. &lt;/&gt;Thanks yet again for the perfect recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since we&#039;ve had our first snow I decided to try a little variation on this: after finishing the recipe as written (but sans peeling), I covered it with slices of &lt; HREF=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raclette&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;raclette &lt;&gt;. Really, really wonderful, warming, and with a bowl of Trader Joe&#039;s cornichons and a salad, a quick dinner. But probably best eaten rarely or only on snowshoeing days. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m making these tonight for the second time -- the first was with little round new potatoes, which I neither peeled nor halved.  Tonight&#039;s are fingerlings, so I did halve them -- still no peeling.  Both times we used sage, since we&#039;ve got some out in the yard.  Utterly scrumptious.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I am pretty much always ready for potatoes.  My grandma made the best, richest, creamiest, mashed potatoes when I was a little girl, all butter and the perfect amount of salt.  I didn&#039;t think anyone could top that, but someone named Mario, from Cape Verde, taught my fella his version years ago, when they were both seasonal workers here.  And, well ... heaven.  Lots of butter and milk, always.  Hard-boiled eggs and bacon, usually.  (We use real fat with impunity.)  Sometimes some celeriac (which I am trying to like).  Other twists too ...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;We&#039;re also crazy about a recipe from &lt;&gt;Passionate Vegetarian&lt;&gt; (Oven-Baked Spudlets, if you know the book), where you start the potatoes on the stove and finish them in the oven -- seriously delicious.  Crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Oh, sweet ole potato.  Mmmm.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Many, many thanks for adding this version to my repertoire.  We love it.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Happy time away to you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did try these with the no-way-I&#039;m-peeling-these-things version. I gave it a few gentle stirs but mostly tossed them in the pan and they were faboo. For some reason, the skins didn&#039;t peel back at all. I thought they would too but they were just perfect that way, and got some extra vitamins into the girls to boot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good sweet lord, did I never reply to these comments?  I am so sorry.  ACK!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;To those of you inquiring about leaving the potato skins on, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve already tried it for yourself and don&#039;t need my input, but to answer your question, yes, you can certainly skip the peeling.  &lt;&gt;However&lt;&gt;, I venture to guess that the finished potatoes might look kind of messy and ugly, with scraggly skins falling off and whatnot.  But they should still taste delicious!  If you tried it, let me know.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Anne, I highly recommend Silpats, yes.  I can&#039;t say that I have used them for much savory baking - mainly for cookies and the like - but I think they would work just fine.  I clean mine with warm water and a soapy sponge, and it&#039;s really a cinch.  As for yogurt, I don&#039;t have a particular brand, but I do tend to choose ones that say &quot;brassÃ©&quot; on the label, which means that they have been whipped or beaten.  They tend to be very smooth and require less stirring than other kinds.  Either way, French yogurt is not at all like Greek yogurt.  It&#039;s much the same texture as normal yogurt here in the States - only with richer, tastier milk.  It&#039;s SO good.  Have a great trip!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Abra Exonar, I wish I could help you with the post count thing, but I&#039;m afraid I don&#039;t know how!  My template here is really, really old - from the days before Blogger started putting a post count on the archives.  So I never had to contend with that problem.  Have you tried doing a Google search?  You might find something that way.  Fingers crossed!  And P.S.  Thank you for your sweet words!  I&#039;m glad you said hello.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Leah, I&#039;m so glad you liked these - and the tomatoes in the September &lt;&gt;Bon Appetit&lt;&gt;!  Hooray!  So glad.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And last but not least, Jack would like to thank everyone who left a comment here to welcome him.  He&#039;s getting a big head from all your kind compliments, but I&#039;ll do my best to keep him in check.  Hee hee.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can&#039;t wait to try this recipe and I have a green container of pert little roma tomatoes from Union Square Greenmarket on my kitchen table, patiently waiting for me to slice, season, and roast per your pomodoro al forno recipe in BA.  Exciting stuff!&lt;/&gt;I just have to disagree about your tarragon comment.  It is le mieux du meilleur in a summery vichyssoise!&lt;/&gt;Have a look: http://devourthis.typepad.com/devour_this/2008/08/nothin-fishy-about-it.html&lt;/&gt;P.S.  Did I use that French correctly?]]></description>
