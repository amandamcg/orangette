					<description><![CDATA[I have to admit, I am such a huge fan of the process of eating artichokes, that I cannot stomach a recipe that tells you to get rid of the outer leaves! I snip off the prickles, steam them whole, and we dip them in garlic butter or dill dip. My kids love them!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I may try your method as a sauce on already made artichokes...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Am I really missing something?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How weird, Nikki!  I&#039;m so sorry about that!  I wonder if you maybe didn&#039;t cook them long enough?  Were they good and tender when you tasted them? Raw artichokes can taste very bitter.  That&#039;s the only thing I can think of...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been dreaming about this recipe all day, so I picked up some baby artichokes at trader joes.  It smelled wonderful while it simmered on the stove, I couldn&#039;t wait!  But they turned out bitter, I couldn&#039;t even swallow them!  Do you think it was the artichokes??  I&#039;m trying another batch next week!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I absolutely love this column, but Molly, I wish you could experience autumn on the East Coast!  I live in Virginia and fall is my favorite season.  The weather is crisp and dry and glorious here.  I just got back from a wedding in upstate New York and it was much the same.  We reveled in the local apple harvest and a joyous area &quot;pumpkinfest.&quot;  If you live out East, this season is something to look forward to eagerly, not dread!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[P.G Wodehouse is one of my all time favourite authors. I loved the TV series of Jeeves and Wooster too - have you ever seen it? With Stephen Fry, it&#039;s wonderful. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Also, I actually love preparing globe artichokes, I love it when they are young and you cut them open and they are tinged with purple.]]></description>
