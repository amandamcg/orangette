					<description><![CDATA[I barely had anything in my fridge today but luckily I had the ingredients to this soup (some wilted cilantro stems, half a red onion, garlic) so I made it and it was delicious! Definitely better than the sum of it&#039;s parts! Thanks for posting!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Last weekend I was looking at some particularly robust cilantro stems that I had in the fridge, and I recalled seeing a soup recipe on here that involved little more than canned tomatoes and cilantro stems (turns out I had forgotten about a few of the ingredients, but as luck would have it I had them all on hand). So I made the soup, and it was fantastic-- I especially love the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/carolinejangelo/4358377730/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vibrant, ruby-red color&lt;/a&gt;. Will definitely be making it again this week; that remaining half of a jalapeno begs to be used soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was just turned on to this site. I love fresh food, and I&#039;ve been looking for a good tomato soup recipe since all the canned stuff is full of corn syrup. This one sounds like a winner! Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm yes, the jalapeno and lime really work. In fact lemon or lime seem to be pretty damn fine for spicing anything up. Have you tried adding miso? I know the sweet-sour taste isn&#039;t everyone&#039;s cup of tea, but it really adds body (to the soup, not me, it&#039;s not high in calories) - which you particularly need if you&#039;re a vegetarian. Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yum!  This was so easy.  I took a shortcut and used a can of crushed tomatoes (and they were on sale).  The soup was missing the chunky factor, so I added a can of kidney beans and dumped in some frozen corn and cooked brown rice.  It made a very serviceable and cheap vegetable soup!  Thanks Molly!&lt;/&gt;-Michelle]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly --&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The soup was exactly as you described, maybe moreso: bright, soothing, fragrant, hearty, and delicious. I followed your recipe to the letter, except I doubled the amount -- good thing, too, since I know that the beer-rye-carroway quick break I baked to go along with it will appreciate having its sprightly pal alongside it for another couple-few meals.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You are an angel of the kitchen, and thank you for sharing your recipes.]]></description>
