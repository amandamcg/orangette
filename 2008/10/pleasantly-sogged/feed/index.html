					<description><![CDATA[In a rare move, I bought some delicious multigrain bread from the nice farmers&#039; market bread people today. Fortunately I had also bought a sexy bunch of cavolo nero, and had one egg at home. Plus I&#039;m only on episode 6 of this season of Mad Men. Yours was an appreciated component of this S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y...NIGHT!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hi, I love your blog and I think you are a fantastic writer!  I just wanted to give you a tip that I can tell by your writing that you will love.  When you make chicken stock ad a very small amount of a fresh herb called lovage.  It gives chicken soup this savory, unimaginably perfect quality that you may recognize if you have ever had a really good bouillion cube.  Try it...you will freak!  Yam]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know that this is a comment on an old recipe, but I wanted you to know that I stirred polenta in with the kale and broth while it was cooking and stirred every few minutes.  It is a riff on a Bittman recipe from a couple of years ago.  Anyways, polenta, kale and an olive oil fried egg on top - yum!  (Anything is better with an egg on top!)]]></description>
