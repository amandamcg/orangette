					<description><![CDATA[Just a note on the cyanide in the apple seed concern (when I read this my reference librarian-ness just had to respond): the number of apple seeds needed to obtain a lethal dose is +-1/2 c crushed and eaten and the apple seed coat keeps the chemical inside even if swallowed.  So unless you chop up the apple seeds before use there will be no discernible amount of cyanide (if any) in the glaze.  See http://everything2.com/title/Apple+seed or http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/apples.asp for discussion.&lt;br /&gt;And I enjoyed your book, even wrote a review on it for the local newspaper. Good luck with the restaurant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to thank you for this recipe! I made it last night and it was fabulous. I think the reason I love it so much is that it is simple and the apples and delicious pastry can shine through - it&#039;s not all gussied up with spices like cinnamon and cloves and so on. I&#039;ll be making this again and again. &lt;/&gt;Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are you playing Ticket to Ride Europe?  If not, I suggest you buy it, master the ferry system, and beat the pants off of Sam.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;(I know that sounds horribly competitive, but splendid kale recipes make me rather partial to you.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi all.  I am &lt;&gt;waaay&lt;&gt; late in replying here - so sorry - but thank you for all the wise suggestions about rabbit!  I really do want to try it again, and your thoughts are a huge help.  You are gems.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And thank you, too, for your feedback on the apple tart!  The cider idea is so smart, and the cheese sounds fascinating too.  I&#039;ve had an apple pie with cheddar in the crust, and it was delicious, so how could you go wrong?&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And lastly, Meg, that&#039;s a good point about the apple seeds.  I hadn&#039;t even thought about it.  It may be silly of me, but I&#039;m not terribly worried - it just seems like &lt;&gt;such&lt;&gt; a tiny amount - but if it bothers you, well, maybe knock or cut the seeds out of the cores before you put them in the pan?  That&#039;s an easy solution.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lord Yes!!!  Apple tart, you&#039;re next in line...but you&#039;ve a steady climb to surpass the sweet, unctuous, oh-so-virtuous delight of BOILDED KALE!  I&#039;ll gladly down bowl-fulls of BK with a grin on my face.  This sweet/tart apple delight will be my just reward...not that I need one.  Thank you dear wonder for stripping the veil from my kale-shy eyes.  I&#039;m in love.  -Lorene]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my goodness, I am so excited to try this one out! A big basket of apples from this week&#039;s market is calling to me. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;An early incident of ordering rabbit at a restaurant and having an uncle call it &quot;bunny&quot; over and over has turned me off a bit from attempting it myself, but perhaps I&#039;ll give it another shot.]]></description>
