Me, too--the addition of Parmesan cheese, that is. I&#039;ve been doing it for years.  Like you, I often use boneless pork loin instead of chicken in all of those wonderful schnitzel and Italian recipes that call for veal or chicken cutlets--I grew up in Iowa. I also agree about peas--if you can&#039;t pick them fresh from the garden, go with frozen. I&#039;ve given up on ever finding a usable fresh pea in a supermarket, and have never seen them in the farmers&#039; markets I&#039;ve frequented.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I too am a long-time Orangette fan and happily lap up any and all posts. Waiting just makes each new discovery all that more delicious!

A couple tips I learned from an Iraqi friend who makes schnitzel....he adds a dollop of Dijon mustard to the whipped egg. Adds a little &quot;something something&quot; to the flavor. He also throws in some sesame seeds in the panko/bread crumbs--they taste wonderfully nutty when fried.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, it&#039;s shocking to see that anyone feels this moment of orangette is &quot;over.&quot;  For me, it&#039;s completely the opposite. I always loved the site for your recipes and writing. But now, with the twists and turns of your remade life, this reader feels more connected than ever. What a treat to meet Ash!! Ash reminds me of my child, who is also not binary, and quite short, and a *very* handsome devil. It fills this mother&#039;s heart with gladness to see a grown-up version of my teenager... but happy and fulfilled and in love. High school is wretched for most kids--imagine being 17 and queer in every way. Thanks to you and your beloved for demonstrating that it really does get better <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f49c.png" alt="ðŸ’œ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly: I don&#039;t think Orangette is over. As a reader that does &quot;click&quot; over several times a week to see if you&#039;ve posted anything new, I also understand that this &quot;season&quot; of your life has many demands that need attention far more than your hungry readers (for your writing). I choose not to be demanding or needy. Rather, I will continue to check for a new post with the anticipation of Christmas morning. I feel confident in saying that I believe Orangette is still your soul&#039;s home, but the business of life and love, single-motherhood of a five-year-old, a business, and an a aging parent all pull at the precious minutes of your day (been there, done that). I am weary just thinking about/remembering it all. Like good friends who don&#039;t talk for years, I will rejoice when I hear your voice again and know that it will feel as familiar as if we just spoke. Be well, Molly. &#060;3]]></description>

I don&#039;t feel your blog is over at all - this is just another chapter in your life and food is still a part of that.  There will be another chapter that will involve recipes and more about your writing that we all will enjoy.  Keep blogging please!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It would be so nice, Molly, if you would bid a proper farewell to your dearly beloved blog. (And to us, your faithful readers.) Orangette feels over, and I think we all can understand that; you&#039;ve moved on in so many different ways and directions, and writing about food or posting recipes probably isn&#039;t &quot;you&quot; anymore. But it would be lovely to hear your final thoughts on this chapter of your life ... and where and when we might all meet again.  all best...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My little brother and I tune into Spilled Milk, and then I found your blog! Your writing is funny and descriptive, and I appreciate the tidbits into your life amidst the cooking. It&#039;s a lot like how you are on the podcast. Which should seem like an obvious connection now that I think about it. Anyway, I don&#039;t know if Matthew will be joining you when you have your talk with David Lebovitz, but I hope you can share thoughts on the experience somewhere!]]></description>
