					<description><![CDATA[It might have been me who sent the article. I had read it and check in on your blog. I am dancing the post divorce dance and always aspire to approach life with grace and laughter. I appreciate your craft and candid expression. Keep it coming. 
Cheers and bon appetit, keep your chin up.

					<description><![CDATA[Slowly catching up on your blog posts while wait for the British operator to connect me. I&#039;ve been &quot;number one in the queue&quot; long enough to enjoy many and many links as well. My kids have also never had a chicken cutlet! Maybe I&#039;ll whip up your recipe - it seems very English actually although I really don&#039;t get mashed peas....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly,
I first found your podcast and found myself laughing and enjoying it so much that I found your book &quot;Delancy&quot; at my local library and I just finished reading it. I didn&#039;t expect it, but I cried at the end of the book. I also recently listened to the &quot;Bolognese&quot; podcast and maybe the convergence of the two caused me to channel some sort of emotion to make me cry. (BTW I hate to cry and don&#039;t do it often). But I think the tears were of compassion and &quot;sisterhood&quot; , if that&#039;s a thing? Needless to say,  really enjoyed the book and am excited to make the tomato and corn salad when we hit tomato season here in the Boston area. I&#039;ve been enjoying your blog a lot too and I am not usually one to leave comments but I wanted to let you know how much I enjoy your writing and in our world of uncertainty and discord, I believe your writing IS necessary. We need to be able to laugh and recall nostalgic moments and you do that so beautifully in your writing. I&#039;m going through a reinvention of my career and hope one of these days to visit Seattle and enjoy a pizza and a cocktail at Delancy and Essex! I look forward to reading &quot;A Homemade Life&quot; and working through all the podcasts. With much gratitude, 
Donna 
P.S. I already have a SquareSpace website (which is fabulous) and I&#039;m about to buy a ThirdLove bra and I eat Talenti gelato often. And I promise to write a review on Spilled Milk soon too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back, we&#039;ve missed you!  I&#039;ve been thinking of you during your absence, wondering how you&#039;re doing in your new life. And although today&#039;s writing was indeed about food,  you cleverly, with just one word, told us what is happening in your life. I wish you happiness and good luck!]]></description>
