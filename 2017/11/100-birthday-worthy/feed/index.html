					<description><![CDATA[I’ve made these scrumptious blondies twice and highly recommend them.  The first time I made them (several months ago), I followed the directions to the letter and they turned out beautifully.  I can now tell you that making several substitutions can still yield wonderful results.  Amid this COVID 19 isolation period, I discovered the remaining  caramel shards in the freezer which set the urge to bake these immediately.  I did not have enough brown sugar, all purpose flour, nor any milk chocolate.  So... using a scale, I added turbinado sugar to my brown sugar and weighed out the all purpose flour with a combination of Bob’s Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flour.  I chopped up some Ghiradelli semisweet baking squares and all ends well - at least on the Butterscotch blondie front.  

Wishing all well with a safe haven for these times.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These are now my go-tos for parties or work events. My supervisor whines if I don&#039;t make them. They&#039;re so easy (I don&#039;t always make the caramel shards, and they&#039;re great either way) and a major crowd-pleaser. Thank you, Molly!]]></description>
