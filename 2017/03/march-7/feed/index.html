					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read your blog for years and have never commented, but I always check to see if  you&#039;ve been back here... I am now divorced too and the things you&#039;re saying here in this post are beyond relatable. I too am in a house that we bought together and now I live there as the sole human amoungst two cats and two dogs. And one betta.  We didn&#039;t have any human kids, but I&#039;m close to his parents and the new normal is challenging. Moving things around and adding new things is both elating and gives me abit of nausea, very one foot in front of the other. I always want to ask on IG if you  would read my blog, but I haven&#039;t and I always forgive my readers for not commenting, because your blog is my favorite and your voice has always spoken to me, and I never said anything all these years. But now I&#039;m just saying thanks, no matter if you never return here, thank you!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly:
Today is my Dad&#039;s birthday. He would have been 89 today. He passed away over five years ago,  11 months after our daughter Katrina lost her battle with Breast Cancer.  
My dad loved the oatmeal pancakes that I would make for him the two months he lived with us. I always think of my dad when I make them now for his great grandchildren.  At times like tomorrow, for Easter Brunch. 
I&#039;ve always loved that picture of your Dad. I would see it in his office at Mercy, I think. When I asked Gary about it, he told me your Mom took the picture.   
Wishing you and Ash and young June a lovely Easter Weekend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Molly...
Your post reminded me of my father .. I lost him 4 and a half years ago ..he would have been 61 now ... I was 19 back then ..
I realise more and more everyday how hard it is for me to start my &quot;adult life&quot; without him by my side .. He left me when i needed him most and that just makes me ache .. Your dear dad was right ... Life is hard ..may he rest in peace 

Today i made your banana bread , can&#039;t wait to have some with a glass of milk first thing in the morning . Whenever i feel bad i find myself in the kitchen baking something delicious while reading  food blogs , en particulier , yours.

Sending you hugs all the way from france !
Cheers

					<description><![CDATA[Just stopping by, hoping for a new post, moved all over again by this. You have such a gift for writing. I&#039;m three years older than you and went through so many of the same things before you- born in Oklahoma to a doctor and a housewife, move to Seattle for grad school at UW, marriage, baby, postpartum mood disorder, divorce, new love. I feel like you manage to give me better insight into all of it. Thank you for sharing.]]></description>

I think that t&#039;s poor practice to shove the ashes down there and just ignore them. They don&#039;t compress that much, and a wood fire in an open fireplace leaves a lot of ash. Usually, the home owner waits until the ashes have died out completely, shovels the ashes into a small METAL lidded gabage can, and puts them outside far from anything flammable. Then, you can sweep the hearth, and sweep that small amount of dust down the chute.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just so you know - my chimney sweeper told me that I could go 20 years and not have to clean out the ashes from that little chute. He said they settle and break down over time. So, yea for not having to clean that sucker out and just shove ashes down there. &#060;3]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://orangette.net/2017/03/march-7/#comment-62888&quot;&gt;Theodore(Ted) Webb&lt;/a&gt;.

I am Moe&#039;s (Burg&#039;s) younger brother, although now 81. The passage of almost 15 years since he died is like a day. Moe and I used to call each other every day, often several times a day, as we both enjoyed our adulthood, and friendship, and memory. You see, we both grew up in Toronto, in an apartment over our dad&#039;s store, on a busy street, and surrounded by everything from neighborhood grocery stores and egg stores to heavy industry with a blast furnace. An education just for looking with curiosity. Moe might call me and ask, &quot;Queen Street, east of Spadina, south side, seventh store in, what was its name, and what did it look like?&quot; And I might answer &quot;McIntyre and Taylor, they had a double display window with cast iron fireplace tools, and a few motor castings.&quot; And Moe might answer, &quot;Son-of-a-bitch!&quot; and hang up.
But in those earlier days, when his friendship with Ted Webb was active, I admired the large and small airplane models that Ted built,. and when Ted went off in uniform, he gave me his fly rod. A South Bend 59, 9 foot bamboo rod, that I used regularly all the years since then to not long ago at all. Good memories.  All good memories.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My cousin frequently says a phrase to her kids that has become one of my go-to phrases, now that I have a couple of boys rolling around in my house. Never has it been more appropriate than at this moment, however:
Good golly, Miss Molly.
(I haven&#039;t been by here in a long while. I&#039;m just catching up.)

You get to be happy. Brandon and June get to be happy. Happy just shifts and changes more than we were taught to expect, I think. The forms of happy grow with us and growth spurts are hard to predict after adolescence.

Fingers crossed for your happiness, Molly. xoxo]]></description>
