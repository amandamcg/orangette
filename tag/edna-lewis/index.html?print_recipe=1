    <p>I don’t ordinarily like baking with whole wheat flour, to be perfectly honest. I am told that this constitutes some sort of major personality flaw, like finding real enjoyment in making babies cry, but I can’t help it. However, that said, when I set out to make this cake, whole wheat flour somehow seemed right. It seemed fitting for an everyday sweet, the kind of thing you would want to snack on, rather than save for after dinner. I had a bag of <a href="http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/king-arthur-white-whole-wheat-flour-5-lb">white whole wheat flour</a> in the fridge, so that’s what I used, and it’s a great product. I combined it with regular all-purpose flour, using equal amounts of each, and the finished cake has a subtly nutty flavor and a hearty texture, which is exactly what I was after.</p>

                                <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 stick (4 oz.) unsalted butter, at room temperature          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 ¼ cups granulated sugar          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            3 large eggs          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            2 tsp. vanilla extract          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 cup white whole wheat flour          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            2 tsp. baking powder          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            ¼ tsp. salt          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            A few gratings of nutmeg, or to taste          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            ½ cup whole milk or plain yogurt, at room temperature          </div>
                  </div>
  
      <div itemprop="instructions">
      <p>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan with butter or cooking spray.</p>
<p>In the bowl of a stand mixer, blend the butter and the sugar until light and fluffy. One by one, add the eggs, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract, and beat to blend.</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.</p>
<p>Add about ¼ of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, and beat on low speed to incorporate. Add 1/3 of the milk or yogurt, and beat again. Add the remaining flour mixture in three more doses, alternating each time with a bit of milk or yogurt, and beating to just combine. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and stir to incorporate any flour not yet absorbed.</p>
<p>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it evenly across the top. Bake for about 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (This cake seems to want to brown quickly on top, so after about 20 minutes, you might want to peek into the oven and tent the cake with aluminum foil, if necessary.) Cool in the pan on a rack for 20 minutes; then remove the sides of the pan and continue to cool.</p>
<p>Serve at room temperature. Or slightly warm, if you want.</p>
<p>Note: I store this cake at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap. It’s very good on the first day, but I like it even better on the second. By the third day, it starts to dry out, but it still tastes good.</p>
