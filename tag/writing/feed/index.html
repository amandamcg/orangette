					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hi! Finally! It had been so long since I&#8217;d posted here, it took me most of an hour to figure out how to do it! I don&#8217;t plan to write on Orangette again, though I loved it, all almost-fifteen years of it. But I have made a new online home for my writing, something that feels both different and familiar, and I invite you to join me over there. It&#8217;s called I&#8217;ve Got a Feeling, and it&#8217;s a newsletter, which means that you can subscribe and, just like magic, receive every post in your email inbox. You can read all about it right here. Thank you, thank you, and let&#8217;s go. xx</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>That year went quickly. I didn&#8217;t mean to abandon anybody, have always said that I&#8217;d be clear about the end of this blog when the time came, but then the end came and went and I hardly noticed. I only noticed that I was interested in other things, and that it felt good to let myself be pulled along by the current. A year ago September, September of 2017, I started work on a proposal for a new book. I had started reading again, more than just my perfunctory fifteen minutes before sleep. Hearing different voices and other people&#8217;s thoughts in my head, I started to notice the way they excited me, energized me, made me want to do my&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I got Junie into bed on time tonight, the first night in a week, and to celebrate, I&#8217;m sitting at the table, listening to the birds outside, thrilling at the fact that it&#8217;s 8:24 pm and I haven&#8217;t yet flipped on a single light switch. And because it feels like time is on my side (yes it is, la la la, though probably just for tonight), I wanted to pop in the door and say a small something. Hello. I don&#8217;t feel very interested in writing about food. It has felt jarring and incongruous to write about food and cooking these past months, like I&#8217;d be doing that old Wizard of Oz number, pulling levers and pushing buttons, yelling Pay no attention to that&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>There was a chair in the front window of my teenage bedroom, but I almost never sat there. It faced into the room, because all there was to see outside was the house across the street, with its dirty-blond buzz-cut of a yard and a security system sign staked by the door. The chair was next to my bookshelf, and as such, it mostly collected books I was too lazy to shelve. The only time I sat in it, that I remember anyway, was the day before I left for college. It was late afternoon, maybe early evening. My dad was standing in the doorway, one shoulder against the frame. He’d been keeping me company while I kneeled on the&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Today it&#8217;s been 14 years since my dad died, and in most ways, it seems like longer than that. I&#8217;ve done a lot of living &#8211; maybe too much? &#8211; in those 14 years. But I can still hear his voice in my head, and I can still feel the hug he gave me in our driveway before I left to drive to Seattle for graduate school, in September of 2002. Burg would be 87 now, and I&#8217;m sort of glad I never had to see him diminished by old age &#8211; or, at least, not more than he was diminished in his last weeks, as cancer had its way with him. He would be glad to know that Mom and I now&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always been drawn to the things we’re not supposed to talk about. I remember the night when, toward the end of writing A Homemade Life, I got into bed, switched off the light, and suddenly was hit with a very bad idea, an almost electric impulse to write about my father’s death. I wanted to take it out of my head and put it somewhere else: the color of his skin, the strange percussion of his breath, the nurse calling up the stairs in the middle of the night. I wasn’t writing a book about my dad, and I wasn’t writing a book about death; I was writing a food memoir, tra la la, with fifty recipes and a&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I started my Monday by listening to Blood Orange until my ears fell off, which was nice. Then my friend Jenny told me to watch this (old-news) video (that I somehow had never seen before), and with that, my week is off and running. Hi to you. Now, business: 1. The Guardian kindly invited me to write about a food that evokes home, and I wrote about a dead-simple, bare-cupboard soup that was first made for me by my aunt Tina. That&#8217;s her below, on the right, living the early-eighties hot tub life with me and my cousins. Most people thinks that June gets her hair color and texture from Brandon, but world, let it be known that I think she&#8217;s got my texture&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Helloooooooooooooooo. I didn&#8217;t mean to be gone for so long. I know what some of you were thinking, and I am delighted to report that I did not give up on blogging. I also did not die. But it&#8217;s been a long, hard, dizzying summer, I will say that, with, among other things, Herculean staffing woes at Delancey, Essex, and Dino&#8217;s. (Did you know there&#8217;s currently a shortage of restaurant cooks in a lot of cities, including Seattle? I could tell you stories.) But now that June is in school again, I&#8217;ve been able to tiptoe my way back to writing, and that&#8217;s a relief. I turned 38 last week, and that too feels good. I&#8217;ve also been cooking again, after the lazy, happy ease&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Today I come to you from Sitka, Alaska, where I&#8217;ve been since last Saturday, leading a writing workshop on memoir and place. I&#8217;m among the faculty for the first-ever Sitka Arts and Science Festival, a week of multi-disciplinary cross-pollination and collaboration dreamed up by the Sitka Fine Arts Camp and several local partners, with support from the National Endowment for the Arts. It&#8217;s been cool and misty almost every day, summer-in-Sitka-y. I didn’t bring enough clothing for this weather, even though, after fourteen years in the Pacific Northwest, I ought to know better. I’m re-wearing what I did bring. Today is day four for these leggings, day two for this sweatshirt. I’ve been wearing my cheap Uniqlo down vest, and it spits out tiny white&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I am not, in general, someone who keeps a running catalog of her favorites: favorite movie, favorite book, favorite song, favorite color, favorite number, and so on. A couple of decades ago, if pressed, I might have offered The Shawshank Redemption as my favorite movie, because I have a thing for Tim Robbins, and I also have a thing for Morgan Freeman&#8217;s voice, and, of course, it&#8217;s also a first-rate story. But then I moved to Seattle and rekindled my teenage love for Singles, which you know all about because I mention it near-constantly, and because it&#8217;s the only movie I can actually quote lines from. Still, I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d call it my favorite. That&#8217;s a strong word, and it scares&#8230;</p>
