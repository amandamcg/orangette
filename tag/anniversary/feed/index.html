					<description><![CDATA[<p>Today is our eighth wedding anniversary. It&#8217;s also the 11th birthday of this blog, the first day of our first-ever corporate tax audit, and the day that my mother officially moves to Seattle. It&#8217;s a lot of Big Adult Stuff, and I have lots of feelings, including immense gratitude for our accountant. But most of all, I&#8217;m glad that these two wide-eyed pups, the ones in this shot circa 2007, decided to take the great leap that is marriage, that they&#8217;ve kept at it, showing up, cooking, eating, building, building some more, figuring it out, duking it out, and loving, loving, for eight whole years. And I&#8217;m glad that this blog made it all happen. Thanks for being along for&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>This is my favorite photograph from our wedding. Look at those crazy kids! Taking a romantic stroll in the alley behind someone’s apartment building! Blissing out beside the dumpsters! Oblivious to the wonky dinosaur graffiti! It was July 29, 2007, three years ago today, and we were on our way to get married. We had no idea what we might do with ourselves, or who we might become, but we had decided to do it, and become it, together. We still have no idea, and I like that. I wonder what the future will bring. I hope it involves Brandon making his Serious Face, because I’m quite fond of it. Today is also the sixth birthday of this blog. Six.&#8230;</p>
