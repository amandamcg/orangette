					<description><![CDATA[<p>That year went quickly. I didn&#8217;t mean to abandon anybody, have always said that I&#8217;d be clear about the end of this blog when the time came, but then the end came and went and I hardly noticed. I only noticed that I was interested in other things, and that it felt good to let myself be pulled along by the current. A year ago September, September of 2017, I started work on a proposal for a new book. I had started reading again, more than just my perfunctory fifteen minutes before sleep. Hearing different voices and other people&#8217;s thoughts in my head, I started to notice the way they excited me, energized me, made me want to do my&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, while researching rhubarb crumble recipes for the Crisps and Crumbles episode of Spilled Milk (still going strong, 52 weeks a year! and still featuring impromptu hair-metal duets!), I pulled down an old copy of Canal House Cooking, and it fell open to page 57, &#8220;Cutlets Smothered in Peas.&#8221; That&#8217;s when it dawned on me that I had somehow made it to age almost-39 without ever cooking a chicken cutlet, and that my child had somehow made it to age almost-five without ever eating a chicken cutlet. I understand this makes one subject to ridicule and rebuke not only in America, but also in many other parts of the world, including Japan, where panko-breaded, pan-fried chicken&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>There was a chair in the front window of my teenage bedroom, but I almost never sat there. It faced into the room, because all there was to see outside was the house across the street, with its dirty-blond buzz-cut of a yard and a security system sign staked by the door. The chair was next to my bookshelf, and as such, it mostly collected books I was too lazy to shelve. The only time I sat in it, that I remember anyway, was the day before I left for college. It was late afternoon, maybe early evening. My dad was standing in the doorway, one shoulder against the frame. He’d been keeping me company while I kneeled on the&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Today it&#8217;s been 14 years since my dad died, and in most ways, it seems like longer than that. I&#8217;ve done a lot of living &#8211; maybe too much? &#8211; in those 14 years. But I can still hear his voice in my head, and I can still feel the hug he gave me in our driveway before I left to drive to Seattle for graduate school, in September of 2002. Burg would be 87 now, and I&#8217;m sort of glad I never had to see him diminished by old age &#8211; or, at least, not more than he was diminished in his last weeks, as cancer had its way with him. He would be glad to know that Mom and I now&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always been drawn to the things we’re not supposed to talk about. I remember the night when, toward the end of writing A Homemade Life, I got into bed, switched off the light, and suddenly was hit with a very bad idea, an almost electric impulse to write about my father’s death. I wanted to take it out of my head and put it somewhere else: the color of his skin, the strange percussion of his breath, the nurse calling up the stairs in the middle of the night. I wasn’t writing a book about my dad, and I wasn’t writing a book about death; I was writing a food memoir, tra la la, with fifty recipes and a&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I started my Monday by listening to Blood Orange until my ears fell off, which was nice. Then my friend Jenny told me to watch this (old-news) video (that I somehow had never seen before), and with that, my week is off and running. Hi to you. Now, business: 1. The Guardian kindly invited me to write about a food that evokes home, and I wrote about a dead-simple, bare-cupboard soup that was first made for me by my aunt Tina. That&#8217;s her below, on the right, living the early-eighties hot tub life with me and my cousins. Most people thinks that June gets her hair color and texture from Brandon, but world, let it be known that I think she&#8217;s got my texture&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, my mom took June to the aquarium, and Brandon and I spent the day at Dino&#8217;s Tomato Pie, hanging photographs and making lists, getting ready to open the day after tomorrow. Like Delancey and Essex, Dino&#8217;s is owned by the two of us, but this business is more purely Brandon&#8217;s brainchild than either of the first two. I know I once said Delancey was Brandon&#8217;s baby, and then Essex was Brandon&#8217;s baby, but no, Dino&#8217;s is really, really, really Brandon&#8217;s baby. Dino&#8217;s &#8211; which is pronounced deeno, a shortened version of Brandino, the faux-talian nickname some of our friends have given Brandon &#8211; is a pizza tavern, modeled on the kind of place you find along the New Jersey Turnpike. It&#8217;s wood&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Today, on the ole blog: some thoughts about cooking with a kid! After the jump! Because I totally get that not everyone wants to read about kid stuff!  See you next time! June started school last fall, and we enrolled her in a Montessori school. I went to a Montessori-influenced school, myself, from preschool through middle school, and Brandon once spent a year teaching music in a Montessori school, and without going into a whole bunch of educational philosophy that I only vaguely follow and that, as a result, makes me really sleepy, I will just say that I loved the Montessori method as a student, and that it makes a lot of sense to us as parents. (Let&#8217;s ignore, for now, the&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Two Mondays ago, the night before the moving truck was due to arrive at my mother&#8217;s new (Seattle!) house with everything she owns, Brandon suggested making a celebratory dinner. My mother, it was agreed, would choose the menu. After a moment&#8217;s hesitation, she requested steak and Caesar salad. We headed out for groceries. I&#8217;m not going to go into great depth about the steak. I don&#8217;t know. I feel bored just thinking about writing it. You know how to cook steak. Right? You don&#8217;t need me. If you don&#8217;t know how, or if you want to try another method, I can tell you that we use Renee Erickson&#8217;s instructions (for indoor cooking, not grilling) on page 195-196 of her dreamy&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>My mother tells me that she had always loved the house. She used to drive by and admire it. When I was thirteen, it came on the market, and she and my dad snatched it up. The house was built in 1948, old for Oklahoma, painted brick with wrought iron and ivy. It needed a lot of work, and they tore out walls and opened it up, changed everything. It was their biggest, finest collaboration, and they made it exactly what they wanted. It was weird in ways, or maybe quirky is the better word, with a mirror on the ceiling of the downstairs bathroom and Pepto-Bismol pink wallpaper in the dining room. But mostly it was beautiful, obscenely beautiful, full of&#8230;</p>
