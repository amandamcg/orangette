					<description><![CDATA[<p>Today is our eighth wedding anniversary. It&#8217;s also the 11th birthday of this blog, the first day of our first-ever corporate tax audit, and the day that my mother officially moves to Seattle. It&#8217;s a lot of Big Adult Stuff, and I have lots of feelings, including immense gratitude for our accountant. But most of all, I&#8217;m glad that these two wide-eyed pups, the ones in this shot circa 2007, decided to take the great leap that is marriage, that they&#8217;ve kept at it, showing up, cooking, eating, building, building some more, figuring it out, duking it out, and loving, loving, for eight whole years. And I&#8217;m glad that this blog made it all happen. Thanks for being along for&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday morning, on my way into the restaurant, I stopped at the studio where I&#8217;m taking a pottery class and found that a little slab mug I made for June was out of the kiln and ready. I had glazed it in what was supposed to be a matte turquoise but came out more like forest green, and the handle was crooked, because I had rushed it. But in my hand, the glaze felt as smooth as a washed silk button-down I remember my mom wearing in the eighties, so I decided to get over it. I surprised June with it when I got home in the afternoon, and she thanked me with this gasp-and-swoon thing she picked up somewhere,&#8230;</p>
