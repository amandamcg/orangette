					<description><![CDATA[<p>I woke up this morning with that itchy feeling I get when I&#8217;ve gone too long without writing. I have a writer friend who once told me that she didn&#8217;t feel right if she wasn&#8217;t writing regularly, that she woke up each morning needing to write, and until very recently, I didn&#8217;t really believe her, because it never felt that straightforward to me. (I also wanted, uh, just a little bit, to reach out and strangle her with my bare hands; she made writing sound so easy.) I never felt that kind of imperative to be a writer &#8211; or, really, to be anything in particular. Writing sneaked up on me. But now that I&#8217;ve been at it for a&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Friday! It’s rainy here in Seattle, as it often is in June. I don’t mind, but I also wouldn’t mind being in a car on the road between Rome and who knows where in Italy, as I was on this day three years ago, when I went over for Luisa’s wedding.* Let’s go there for a minute. Maybe to a beach on the Adriatic. Ah. Earlier this week, I drove to Spokane and back, which is absolutely nothing like a beach in Italy but is still beautiful in its way, and because I was driving alone, I listened to Girl Talk &#8220;All Day&#8221; very, very loud and did a lot of &#8220;dancing,&#8221; by which I mean flapping my elbows wildly while&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned last week that I had been away at a wedding, Luisa’s wedding, and a number of you wrote that you were eager to see pictures. I felt a little unsure about posting them, to be honest, because it was her wedding day and hers to share, but she says that I can go for it. Here we are. Luisa was one of the first friends I made through blogging. I guess it was about six years ago, give or take a bit. That was when Brandon was still living in New York, and I would go there to see him every couple of months. Luisa was still living in New York then, too. She and I had exchanged&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>So, I wasn’t kidding about the black hole. But I’m sorry to have been gone from here for so long. I’ve missed you. Delancey is getting easier. As of two weeks ago, we now have a prep cook to work in the mornings, which means that instead of going in at 9 am to receive the first deliveries, Brandon can now go in around 11 am, and I go in sometime between noon and 2 pm, depending on the day’s prep list. We still get home around midnight, but it feels a lot easier than it did a couple of weeks ago. We’re getting more sleep, for one thing, but even more importantly, we know what to expect now. That’s&#8230;</p>
