					<description><![CDATA[<p>Today it&#8217;s been 14 years since my dad died, and in most ways, it seems like longer than that. I&#8217;ve done a lot of living &#8211; maybe too much? &#8211; in those 14 years. But I can still hear his voice in my head, and I can still feel the hug he gave me in our driveway before I left to drive to Seattle for graduate school, in September of 2002. Burg would be 87 now, and I&#8217;m sort of glad I never had to see him diminished by old age &#8211; or, at least, not more than he was diminished in his last weeks, as cancer had its way with him. He would be glad to know that Mom and I now&#8230;</p>
