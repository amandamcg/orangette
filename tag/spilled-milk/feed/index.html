					<description><![CDATA[<p>Last night I got to spend some time with my friend Sam. We hadn&#8217;t hung out, just the two of us, for a while &#8211; maybe not since June was born, if I really think about it. Sometime in the next month, Sam will become a dad. We&#8217;ve somehow been friends for nearly a decade. When I got into his car last night, he had R.E.M.&#8217;s Out of Time in the CD player. &#8220;Texarkana&#8221; was on. We got stuck in traffic, because it was rush hour in Seattle, but it was okay, because we were talking about being kids listening to R.E.M., Automatic for the People especially, and all the Big Feelings we were just starting to know then, feelings set&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I woke up this morning with that itchy feeling I get when I&#8217;ve gone too long without writing. I have a writer friend who once told me that she didn&#8217;t feel right if she wasn&#8217;t writing regularly, that she woke up each morning needing to write, and until very recently, I didn&#8217;t really believe her, because it never felt that straightforward to me. (I also wanted, uh, just a little bit, to reach out and strangle her with my bare hands; she made writing sound so easy.) I never felt that kind of imperative to be a writer &#8211; or, really, to be anything in particular. Writing sneaked up on me. But now that I&#8217;ve been at it for a&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>From the summer of 2006 until the early spring of 2011, we lived in a nondescript duplex on 8th Avenue that shared the block with some other nondescript duplexes and one notably terrifying exception that we referred to as Boo Radley’s house. I didn’t love the neighborhood, but it was mostly fine, and after we adopted Jack, I got to know it well, because Jack, being a terrier, needed a lot of walking. We found our habits. If the sun was out, we’d walk up to the P-Patch at 60th and 3rd and ogle people’s tomatoes and dahlias; if it was raining, I’d drag him for a quick loop around the block; and if it was evening, dark already but&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Listen, I know it’s a holiday weekend. Most of you are probably outside, grilling or picnicking or generally engaged in some form of early-summer eating. In fact, as I type this, I can hear my neighbors on their deck, shaking a bag of charcoal briquettes, talking about Neil Diamond. But what I would like to tell them (aside from, HAVE MERCY! NO NEIL DIAMOND TONIGHT!), and you, too, is this: do your future self a favor and go inside and cook a pot of rice. Also, do whatever you have to do to get some Napa cabbage kimchi. Come midweek, your efforts will be rewarded. I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to get around to writing about kimchi&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I have many important things to tell you. 1. I’m doing a podcast! I intended to tell you about this a week ago, but there’s been an illness in my family, and I’ve been away, and it hasn’t been a lot of fun, so, you know, let’s talk about that podcast. It’s called Spilled Milk, and I co-host it with my friend Matthew Amster-Burton. Every time we record an episode, Matthew makes me laugh until I snort, cry, hyperventilate, and/or hoot like an owl, and I hope our show does the same for you. The first episode is on the topic of fried eggs, and you can listen or download it – free! – through the Spilled Milk website, or&#8230;</p>
