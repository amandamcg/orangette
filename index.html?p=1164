  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The summer before last, I had a run-in with one of our neighbors over a blackberry bush. I am not usually the type of person who has run-ins, much less run-ins over fruit-bearing vegetation, but she started it.  Have I told you about our mean, nasty, blackberry-hoarding neighbor?  No? Well, pull up a chair. And bring a spoon, because I have some blackberry frozen yogurt in the freezer, and unlike some people, I don’t mind sharing.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/e7de4-polablackberryclose-11.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/e7de4-polablackberryclose-11.jpg?w=297" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5235994428857042018" border="0" /></a><br />We had moved into our apartment only a couple of months before, and with summer heading into its fullest flush, we noticed a thicket of blackberry bushes in one corner of the backyard.  Needless to say, this was very exciting.  The best part was, they were <span style="font-style:italic;">huge</span>.  Our yard is fenced on only two sides, and the bushes were sufficiently large that, on one of the unenclosed sides, they formed a partial wall along the property line.  As walls go, it was somewhat ugly and unkempt, but it was <span>covered</span> in blackberries.  <span style="font-style:italic;">Covered</span>.</p>
<p>So we started picking, and then we picked some more.  We made blackberry sorbet and a batch of jam.  One afternoon, I decided to make some scones, so I went out with an empty Tupperware to harvest a little more.  I was hunched over, picking intently on our side of the bush-wall, daydreaming about baked goods and probably humming something innocent and uplifting, when I heard footsteps.  I looked up to see our next-door neighbor, the one whose yard adjoins the bushes, marching across the lawn.  She came to a stop a few feet away, looked me up and down, and then spat, “What <span style="font-style:italic;">the hell</span> do you think you’re doing?”</p>
<p>Stunned, I giggled nervously and explained that we had just moved in, and that I had this great scone recipe that my sister had given me, and that I wanted to make a batch with fresh blackberries, and giggle giggle giggle.</p>
<p>“Well, this is <span style="font-style:italic;">my</span> bush,” she snapped.  “I planted it.  And I use it every summ<span style="font-style:italic;">ah</span> to make blackberry c<span style="font-style:italic;">ooorr</span>dial.” [In my mind, when I replay our conversation, I give her an upper-class British accent, even though she doesn’t have one.  I think it makes her seem especially stern, don’t you?  Like a strict governess, or maybe Queen Elizabeth.]</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you that I had a smart retort at the ready, or that I shot her down by pointing out that this particular side of the bush fell on <span style="font-style:italic;">my</span> property or that blackberries are, in this part of the country, a non-native invasive weed, not something that one generally plants.  In fact, they are considered a <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/environment/animalsAndPlants/noxious-weeds/weed-identification/blackberry.aspx">Weed of Concern</a> by King County &#8211; I love that term, “Weed of Concern” &#8211; and if she did indeed plant these bushes, my (tall, imposing) landlord would probably like to have a word with her and, possibly, request that she pay a gardener to remove the bushes from my side of the property line.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I only thought of these things after I had skulked away and gone inside to lie down and contemplate the general cruelty of the universe.  I also contemplated the Robert Frost poem “<a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15719">Mending Wall</a>” and its wise line, “Good fences make good neighbors.”  I love our delicate bush-wall, but for a minute there, I wished for something a little more substantial, like wood or brick or stone.  Preferably with barbed wire on top.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bf719-polablackberryonsteps-11.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/bf719-polablackberryonsteps-11.jpg?w=298" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5235967465424195074" border="0" /></a><br />Of course, I am able to tell you this now because our neighbor is no longer our neighbor.  She still owns the property next door, but she moved out about a year ago and rented it to a couple of girls who are not only nice, but whose wardrobes and hair I covet.  And last Friday afternoon, when it was scorchingly hot and all the blackberries were fat and warm, I took my Tupperware and went picking.  I came back inside a half hour later with one pound of berries &#8211; having also, in that time, had a very nice conversation, pet a cute pug, been invited to a party, and received a glass of lemonade.  I feel much better about everything.</p>
<p>And while I can’t exactly spread the good will by inviting you to the party, which already happened, or by sharing the lemonade, which I already drank, I am happy to pass along the recipe for the frozen yogurt that I made from the blackberries.  I based it on <a href="http://www.davidlebovitz.com/">David</a>’s recipe for strawberry frozen yogurt, which I made twice last month and highly, <span style="font-style:italic;">highly</span> recommend.  It’s not frozen yogurt in the <a href="http://www.pinkberry.com/html/pbmain.php">Pinkberry</a> sense, so don’t start expecting a mound of rippling soft-serve, but it <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> utterly delicious &#8211; and, in my book, so much better.  Also, it’s dead-easy.  You macerate the berries in sugar and a small splash of vodka, puree them with plain yogurt and lemon juice, and freeze.  That’s all.  Think sorbet, essentially, but with a gentle roundness and soft tang from the addition of yogurt.  Our friend <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2008/05/entirely-unmannerly.html">Ben</a> declared it “<span style="font-style:italic;">terrif</span>,” for which we teased him mercilessly.  He was right, though, and assuming that our good neighbors agree, I think I will make another batch this week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Blackberry Frozen Yogurt</span><br />Inspired by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPerfect-Scoop-Sorbets-Granitas-Accompaniments%2Fdp%2F1580088082&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325"><span style="font-style:italic;">The Perfect Scoop</span></a>, by David Lebovitz</p>
<p>1 pound fresh blackberries, rinsed<br />¾ cup sugar<br />2 tsp. vodka<br />1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt<br />1 ½ tsp. fresh lemon juice</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, toss the blackberries with the sugar and vodka, stirring until the sugar begins to dissolve.  Cover, and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour.</p>
<p>In a blender, process the blackberries and their liquid with the yogurt and lemon juice until smooth.  (I generally do this in two batches; it seems to work better that way.)  Place a mesh sieve over a medium bowl, and pour the mixture through the sieve to remove the seeds.  Taste.  It should be a little too sweet at this point, but that’s good; it will taste less sweet when frozen.</p>
<p>Refrigerate the mixture for one hour.  Then freeze in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>Yield: 1 scant quart</p>

      <p>Yummy! I just bought an ice cream maker this summer, and everything that has come out of that machine is 1) delicious, 2) disappears in a flash, and 3) from David&#8217;s book. Blackberry frozen yogurt sounds amazing; I can&#8217;t wait to try it!</p>

      <p>This sounds delicious. I was never that fond of blackberries as they were always only used for blackberry and apply crumble in our house and I wasn&#8217;t one for hot apple desserts as a child but that is thankfully changing now and I ate some delicious blackberry ice-cream last week. Anyway, I don&#8217;t have an ice-cream maker mostly because it would be too dangerous so I may need to try making this without.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m picking up a bushel of nectarines this morning&#8212;I wonder if they would work well in this recipe.  I don&#8217;t see why not&#8230; (I&#8217;m talking to myself).  But then that means I have frozen yogurt to make, along with the green beans that need snapping, the tomatoes that needs roasting, and sauced and salsa-ed, the two bushels of Summer Rambos that need to be turned into sauce.  Maybe if I make the frozen yogurt first, then it can be my sweet reward at the end of today.  If I&#8217;m still awake.  (And no, I&#8217;m not going to get all that done in one day, though I&#8217;m going to try my darndest.)</></>Oh, and speaking of good neighbors, on my pre-dawn run/walk this morning I spoke to a man down the road and asked him if those two giant pear trees that were loaded down with fruit were his.  Yes, they were.  Was he going to do anything with them?  No.  Could I have them.  Yes.  Two pear trees all for me!  Drying, canning, freezing&#8230;.  Can you believe my luck?  More work!  Yay!</p>

      <p>That mean old neighbor.  Where I come from, sharing is expected.  I remember my shock and horror the first time I asked someone for a recipe and I was DENIED.  I begged and pleaded, but was rebuffed almost rudely (this wasn&#8217;t a restaurant recipe mind you &#8211; just a fudge recipe that an acquaintance had come up with).  My feelings were hurt.</></>That said, if you ever make your way to Athens GA, I would not only let you pick delicious wild blackberries from all over my property, but I&#8217;d also tidy up the guest room for you as well.</p>

      <p>That&#8217;s so funny. I guess Seattle is rampant with blackberries because my brother who lives there has blackberries in the bushes behind his house too (that he obviously didn&#8217;t plant and doesn&#8217;t really consider &#8220;his&#8221; because they were just there when he moved in). People come by asking if they could pick some all the time and he just tells them to go right ahead, they&#8217;re not his. </></>He did get his chance to make a terrific compote though, don&#8217;t you worry!</p>

      <p>I can&#8217;t believe blackberries are a &#8220;weed of concern&#8221; to King county.

Oh, and should you put up more jam, a generous glug (about a cup per pound) of cassis in the mixture is delicious and really brings out some of the more nuanced flavors of the berry.</p>

      <p>Okay, I grew up in the NW, and who in the hell PLANTS blackberries?? That is just ridiculous, and you have my blood boiling for you, Molly. Blackberries just grow in the NW everywhere, why would you purchase a bush?  I can&#39;t even bring myself to BUY blackberries at the farmer&#39;s market &#8211; it seems just wrong. </></>On a side note, last summer at my old house, my dead-end neighbors ruined a beautiful blackberry growing spot by tearing down all the vines to add a poorly designed driveway.  They used the driveway once, then realized it was too steep &#038; there was barely room for them to turn around in it. Plus, there was a silly gate on it that you had to get out of your car to open. Never saw them use it again.  Such a dumb project!</p>

      <p>I moved into my house last spring and immediately went to work getting the yard in shape.

      <p>Me, that&#8217;s who.  I can totally see myself planting blackberries if I had a yard to plant them in.  Especially in the NW, where they would grow well.  I planted gooseberries and currants in the community yard in my apartment building more than a decade ago.  I was heartbroken when I saw our landlord rip them out a few years later even after I told her what they were.</></>It sounds like Molly made a reasonable mistake, but, yeah, if it&#8217;s in a yard, someone may have planted it or not, but requires tending it, cutting it back, mowing around it, etc. to keep it there.  Wild berries are usually smaller, and thornier than planted ones.  </></>Talking to them about why they aren&#8217;t picking it might come out as &#8220;well, don&#8217;t pick any the week before my grandkids come&#8221; or &#8220;my son promised he&#8217;d help me pick the pears but he&#8217;s been so busy&#8230;&#8221;</></>The saddest part to me about the cordial story is that you can make cordial out of frozen berries which are cheap compared to fresh.  I&#8217;d definitely have offered to trade frozen berries for the fresh ones + work to pick them.</p>

      <p>Hi, everybody.  Thank you for commiserating!  I was bitter about those blackberry bushes for a long time, and I am SO glad that&#8217;s behind me now.  <>Whew<>.</></>To reply to a few things:</></>Rebecca, I am crazy about you.  Thank you, Personal Thug.</></>Two pear trees, Mama JJ?  You lucky lady!  You should make some pear butter to give away at the holidays.  Oh, and about the nectarines: I&#8217;m not sure how they would do here, but what&#8217;s the worst that could happen?  Right?</></>Sarah Beam, I hear you.  Nothing makes me angrier than a &#8220;secret&#8221; recipe.  <>Grrr<>. P.S. We may take you up on your Athens offer one day.  Sounds pretty darn nice&#8230;</></>Shari, I&#8217;ve never tried making ice cream without an ice cream maker, but there must be a way to do it.  I know granitas are traditionally made without any fancy equipment, by just freezing the mixture in a baking dish and stirring it with fork every now and then.  You might look into that &#8211; or yes, see what Lynne Rossetto Kasper has to say.  xo!</></>Bellini Valli, I have heard about Saskatoon berries here and there in recent years, and I really want to try one.  Time to pack up the car and head north, I guess?</></>Patrice, I wish I could help, but I&#8217;ve never tried working with sugar substitutes.  Maybe someone else will pipe up.  Anyone?  Please?</></>Roo, yes, don&#8217;t worry, I do know where the property line is.  The neighbor pointed it out to me when we were having our little run-in, and I confirmed it with our landlord as well.  The bushes pretty much straddle it, although they do lean more toward the neighbor&#8217;s side.  However, the parts of the bush that I was picking from were solidly on our side.  What was most annoying to me, in retrospect, is that the neighbor&#8217;s compost container is also on the property line, but to reach it, she had to come into our yard, because the blackberry bushes block the entry on her side.  So, clearly, the issue of whose property is whose only mattered when she decided it did.  Ah well.  Oh, and yes, like you, I can imagine planting a berry bush, even though they grow wild here.  But I would take care that it was well maintained and confined, and if I had no fence and it straddled the property line, I would be happy to share.</></>Duchess Jane, that is AMAZING.  Ha!  I love it.  Did you do a victory dance after she went back into her yard?</p>

      <p>Anonymous, you are certainly entitled to disagree with me, but I have to disagree with you on a couple of points:</></>1. I was embarrassed because I had been scolded.  And because I was terribly surprised at having been scolded.</></>2. I had no way of knowing, until she told me, that the bush was not every bit as much mine as hers.  As I wrote, it straddled the property line, and there is no fence.  It could have been mine, hers, or no one&#8217;s.</></>Had she spoken to me in a more kind way, rather than cursing at me, I think my feelings would have been very different.  That&#8217;s what was most upsetting.</p>

      <p>This is beating a dead horse, really, but if you were picking from the branches that encroached on your property I&#39;m not sure your possessive neighbor really had any grounds for chasing you away.

It&#39;s sweeter than sugar, so you can use less, and as an invert-type sugar would have the desired textural role, keeping the frozen confection soft.

      <p>Your new neighbors sound lovely. It&#8217;s good to hear the hoarder is gone, meanwhile, can I vent for a moment? I&#8217;ve got a gigantic blackberry bush/wall along my apartment and though my neighbors and I all gladly share the bounty with each other, I was flabbergasted recently when I saw a hired gardener chainsawing off the whole side of it. *sigh*  The thing is producing berries right now, but I can&#8217;t reach any of them, all I can reach now are bare branches torn of their foliage. Having a berry bush in your yard is fantastic and when I found mine gone it was the first time in a while I got truly angry.</></>Oh, sorry. I suppose seeing someone else so happy about blackberries brought out the need to share. 🙂</p>

      <p>The thing is, the fruit of a blackberry bush all tends to mature in a matter of two or three days.  Unless she&#8217;s a marathon canner, she couldn&#8217;t possibly use it all herself.  And what, did she miss the first day of Kindergarten when they teach you how to share?  Good grief.</p>

      <p>Unrelated to blackberries and less-than-pleasant neighbors (mine were sitting around a fire pit last night playing bongo drums&#8230;no joke), I made your &#8220;Winning Hearts and Minds&#8221; cake for the first time yesterday and am in love!  The only problem is that I am eating multiple slices a day and should probably stop before my thighs burst forth from the seams of my jeans.  I think you mentioned freezing it, which would be a good solution.  Any suggestions for wrapping/freezing/thawing successfully?  </></>I also tried your flour tortillas with some fajitas and homemade salsa last weeekend (and let&#8217;s not forget the margaritas).  They turned out perfectly and left us a stash for the freezer as well.  The next time you head to Oklahoma City, have Brandon pick up some tortillas at Ted&#8217;s on May.  They are almost like pancakes and are brought in endless supply&#8230;nothing like it.</p>

They are actually very sweet people with a real talent for the bongos.  On a Friday or Saturday night, I would have been right over there with them!</p>

      <p>Leslie, I know.  Isn&#8217;t that cake dangerous?  I made one for our anniversary and wound up forcing half of it on some friends, because I couldn&#8217;t stop eating it.  </></>But anyway, yes, it freezes beautifully, so that&#8217;s a perfect solution.  If you have a piece of clean cardboard lying around, or a cardboard cake circle, just transfer it onto that (or onto a plate that you don&#8217;t mind putting in the freezer), wrap the whole thing in plastic wrap, and then wrap it again in foil.  Then freeze.  Thaw at room temperature (it takes a good 12 hours, I find), still wrapped.  It works like a charm.</></>And thanks for the reminder about Ted&#8217;s!  The group of guys I used to hang out with in high school LOVED that place.  I remember going there with them and eating tons of warm tortillas with butter.  Ahhh.</p>

      <p>I wanted to let you know that I&#8217;m in love with your blog.  Everytime I read it I wish I was in Seattle too enjoying a mild summer and some rain.  I actually spent about 2-3 weeks of random time at work reading every entry from the beginning and every day I couldn&#8217;t wait to read more stories and get some great new recipes (which are pretty fantastic despite the apricot torte with apricots that were FAR to sour but ice cream fixes everything right?)</></>Anyway, I just finally wanted to let you know how much I love to escape to the world of Orangette.  I even made some of the choc. chip cinnamon sugar banana bread tonite that was deeelicious and inspired me to say hello.</p>

      <p>We live in a development that was an old fruit farm&#8211;we have fig bushes, pears, apples, and plums all on an adjoining piece of land that belongs to my uncle (so I have free run of the place!).</></>The last two years my little cousins were living in the house on the property, and they went around and systematically whacked the daylights out of every single piece of fruit on every bush and tree.  I could have cried.</></>This year my children are the ones around and they don&#8217;t seem at all interested in whacking fruit (thank heaven!  It must be an inherited respect for the fact that they&#8217;re FOOD&#8211;yummy, yummy food).  So I have the prospect of a Fall full of apple, plum, fig, and pear everything!  I can hardly wait!!!</></>Oh, and since we&#8217;re on Bainbridge, we have ten million blackberries too.  My son and his friend want to open a &#8220;blackberry stand&#8221; where people give them a dollar and the boys let them pick blackberries.  I can&#8217;t bring myself to tell them that most people don&#8217;t bother paying for blackberries on Bainbridge; they just go to the public park and pick them!  </></>Perhaps I&#8217;ll tell them I&#8217;ll make them some blackberry turnovers if they pick them and bring them to me, and I&#8217;ll sneak in a little of this frozen yogurt for myself!</p>

      <p>Blackberries can become an obsession, albeit an anti-oxidant laden, free-radical fighting one. Some friends of mine and I recently picked 10 pounds of the bejeweled lovelies, and made them into blackberry mint jam and blackberry jalapeno jam. Truly the stuff of dreams!</p>

      <p>What is it with Ballard neighbors? I moved to Ballard a couple years ago and got in a similar stink with the lady next door, but about the curb parking in front of her house.

Why don&#8217;t you move back to the U-District? she yelled. Why don&#8217;t you move back to Bellevue? I wish I&#8217;d yelled back.

Briefly&#8230; one day my dad went outside and found a neighbor (with a chainsaw) cutting down 1 of our 2 apple trees, terming it an &#39;eyesore&#39;.  Dad was so angry.  Fighting angry.  But the damage was done &#038; the tree was a stump.  Tree #2 stopped flowering of course.  And for years did not produce apples.</></>Well, last year dad died and this spring while cutting the grass I looked up and by god it had flowered!  I peeked thru the fence and the NEW neighbors had planted a flowering crab apple, which I suppose made it possible for our apple to flower!  Wonder of wonders.</p>

Although I admit if it had been me I would have probably spent all my time scheming on how to get the berries like some kind of old-fashioned cartoon (sneaking in the night, etc.) The ice cream looks beautiful&#8230;such wonderful colors. I plan to try.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m late to the party, but I&#8217;ll add my two cents anyway!</></>I agree with Chanterelle, there are lots of details and restrictions regarding property lines. Of course, I don&#8217;t know them. 🙂</></>Ali, I just don&#8217;t understand why someone would do that without at least talking to the owner first! Years ago my mom&#8217;s neighbor ripped out some bushes that my grandfather had planted, at the home he built, and both she and I grew up in. </>Of course, it was in the middle of the day, so there was no chance of stopping the gardeners. She claimed it was on her property&#8230; Until my mom had the county come out and mark it. And with a little &#8220;encouragement&#8221; from a lawyer we had some new foliage planted, but it&#8217;s not the same.</>It&#8217;s just so darn rude!</p>

      <p>I made it yesterday. It came out SOOO good. We had some for desert  (perfect after a swiss chard lasagne and a salad) and I ate the rest straight out of the freezer after I came back from teaching my first class today.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly &#8211; I&#8217;m with Julie &#8211; what was she going to do, come over to your yard to pick &#8220;her&#8221; blackberries??  Scary neighbors are a nightmare, how glad you must be that she&#8217;s gone!</p>

      <p>Molly, come move in next to me, I&#8217;ll plant berry bushes galore for you if you&#8217;ll share your delicious scones!  I haven&#8217;t made a single recipe yet that you&#8217;ve recommended that hasn&#8217;t been exquisite.  You should have given her a scone, she&#8217;d probably tell you to pick them anytime so long as you share 😉</p>

      <p>What a rude woman your neighbor was. I was going to say that I hope she was forcibly moved to the Norse Home, or Ida Culver, or some other assisted living facility, but that would be unkind (not to mention how miserable it would be for her unsuspecting fellow residents). And, rough on the family that had to move her!</></>Your recipe sounds great, Molly. I might have to try and pick some of my own blackberries, tho they should still be selling them at the farmer&#8217;s market on Sunday. And if they have no Skagit valley berries, there will be nice Yakima valley peaches and nectarines. Actually, I&#8217;m craving fresh off-the-tree apples already, which indicates that my body believes that fall is here. It usually doesn&#8217;t do that until football season starts, but if it means an early apple pie or pan-dowdy, so be it!</></>And FYI, I agree that our short WA summer is over. Last night, I came home and made a tuna casserole!</p>

      <p>thanks for the recipe. Not having the good fortune of free blackberries at the backyard, I made a version of this with frozen mixed berries based on your recipe. it&#8217;s still very delicious! I can understand why you churn batch after batch of this. 🙂</p>
