    <p>Well. That was not at all what I planned for the month of April.<br />
So long, April. So long, plans.</p>
<p>I want to get this show back on the road. I’ve missed being here, and I’ve missed you. But before we go any further, I want to offer a long overdue thank you to those who came to my readings last month. I thought I had a great time on my first tour, but somehow, I had an even better time this year, despite the fact that I was dealing with a whopping case of laryngitis and could hardly speak. I hope you could hear me, and that you enjoyed it. It made me so happy to meet you. I’ll be high on that well into next year, I think. Which is a good thing, because there won’t be any more touring until I write another book, and writing books takes a while. I’ll keep you posted.</p>
<p>Also, I want to thank you for your very kind comments and e-mails about my grandmother. Nanny, as we called her, passed away on April 15. She’d been slowly declining for a number of years, but the last two were particularly hard for her, and hard for us, and when she got a cold in early April, we knew she couldn’t withstand it. It’s never easy to lose someone, but in this case, to be honest, I’m relieved. She was ready. She’d wanted to go, and she was very vocal about that. If anything, I’m sad that she had to go through so much discomfort, and wait so long, before she could get her wish. I’m happy that she’s free. She’s with my grandfather now, her husband of almost fifty years, who passed away in 1992. I’ll bet they’re <span style="font-style: italic;">elated</span>. Can you imagine? What a reunion.</p>
<p>After she was gone, we had to clear out her apartment, which meant dividing up her belongings. I came home with a lot of photographs. Nanny was very good about writing dates and names and any relevant notes on the back of family photographs, but she wrote only “Feb ‘51” on this one. By the date, I’m guessing that she’s holding her youngest child. I love her hair. I can’t imagine having a baby, plus six other young children running around, and having hair that good. I have only a dog, and a restaurant, if that counts, and my hair is a disaster.</p>

<p>That aside, I also got to keep her recipe box. I know she would like that.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/e58bc-polanannyrecipebox1.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5466127034767415394" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/e58bc-polanannyrecipebox1.jpg?w=293" alt="" width="920" height="941" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>It’s made of enamel, and it’s sturdy and heavy, filled with index cards and newspaper clippings separated into categories by stout green partitions. I flipped through it and was thrilled to find a few dinner party and cocktail party menus among the recipes, jotted on slips of white paper. I can now tell you that on Sunday, December 30, 1984, she and my grandfather had guests in from 3 to 6 pm, and she served:</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Smoked Turkey + Rolls</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Phyllis Dip</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Crudite + Spinach Dip</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Cookies</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Candies</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Chocolate Chip bread</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Fruit cake.</span></p>
<p>She must have served a lot of fruit cake, because I found it listed on other menus, too. I had no idea she was so into fruit cake. I also found the following recipe in the appetizers section, and I have to type it up for you exactly as it was written, because it would be a shame not to share the wealth:</p>
<p><u style="font-style: italic;">Nibbler</u><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Bowl of peanuts + raisins</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Mixed</span></p>
<p>I love Nibbler.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/3be74-polacinntoastspectra-21.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5466130258955493234" class="alignnone" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/3be74-polacinntoastspectra-21.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="1090" height="880" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>But most crucial for our purposes, I found a recipe for something called Cinnamon Toast. I know you’re sitting there like, <span style="font-style: italic;">Riiiight. Cinnamon toast. Tell me something I </span>haven’t<span style="font-style: italic;"> heard</span>, but bear with me, because this is different. It’s not bread that you toast and then butter and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. It’s bread that you cut into triangles, generously coat on both sides with melted butter, dredge in cinnamon sugar, and then bake until crisp. You can keep them in a tin on the counter, where they actually get better with a day or two of age, and you eat them like cookies. I don’t know where the recipe originally came from, but it was written in what I think is my aunt Millicent’s handwriting. My mother tells me that she also has it, and that she’s had it for years. She used to make it all the time, she says, particularly when she was having a morning meeting and wanted something to serve with coffee. I don’t remember ever eating it, and to be frank, I sort of had a hard time believing it could be worth a real, written recipe. I mean, it’s CINNAMON TOAST. But I tried it yesterday, and I was wrong. Nanny, Mom, Millicent, I was wrong. I was so wrong. Next, I’m making Nibbler.</p>
<p>You should try this recipe. I’ve never had anything quite like it. The premise is simple, and so are the ingredients, but it sort of defies categorization. The bread gets crisp and crunchy, and the butter gives it some richness, and the cinnamon sugar caramelizes lightly, going almost lacy at the edges. My mother says it’s “like cinnamon candy,” but to me, the overall experience is closer to a snickerdoodle cookie. Only easier, and faster, and crunchier. Which is to say, I like it even better.</p>

    <p>This recipe in its original form calls for dipping the bread in butter. On both sides. I tried it, and the bread got so saturated that it sort of terrified me. There was a LOT of butter in that little piece of bread. I found that brushing on the butter is a more moderate, palatable approach, and it still works very well. Either way, you’re going to use quite a bit of butter, and please don’t freak out about that. If it helps, keep reminding yourself that this is not breakfast; this is a cookie. Make it your mantra.</p>
<p>Also, the original version of the recipe calls specifically for Pepperidge Farm white bread. My grocery store didn’t have any, so I used Franz brand “Milk and Honey” bread instead. Whatever brand you use, make sure that it’s not too squishy and spongy. The quantities of butter and cinnamon sugar listed below should be pretty close to perfect for six slices of sandwich bread, but if you have extra butter or sugar, just use more bread.</p>
  </div>

      <div class="recipe-list">
                                <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 stick (4 oz.) unsalted butter, cubed
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            6 slices white sandwich bread, or more as needed
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            ½ cup sugar
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            2 tsp. ground cinnamon          </div>
                  </div>
  
      <div itemprop="instructions">
      <p>Preheat the oven to 325°F. If you want, line a baking sheet with parchment or aluminum foil. It makes cleanup easier.</p>
<p>Put the butter into a pie plate or similar baking dish. Slide the dish into the oven, and keep an eye on it. You’re looking for the butter to melt completely.</p>
<p>Stack the slices of bread, and then cut them diagonally into quarters. You should have 24 triangles.</p>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar and cinnamon. Turn the cinnamon sugar out onto a dinner plate, or another pie plate.</p>
<p>When the butter is melted, remove it from the oven, and brush it onto both sides of a triangle of bread. Don’t be shy: apply the butter generously, so no spot is left uncoated. The bread should feel a little heavy in your hand. Dip the bread into the cinnamon sugar, taking care to coat both sides. Lay it on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining pieces of bread.</p>
<p>Bake the toasts for about 25 minutes, until lightly browned. Transfer to a rack. The toasts will crisp as they cool. When cooled, store in an airtight container at room temperature.</p>
<p>Note: These taste best with a little age. When I tasted them on the day they were made, they were just okay, but by the next day, the flavors had come together nicely.</p>

      <p>It&#39;s so wonderful to hear from you Molly. Thanks or the beautiful and touching post on your grandmother &#8211; it&#39;s so wonderful you have the recipes as a link between you. Even if you&#39;ll miss her, I agree that it&#39;s better not to have her suffer any longer &#8211; my grandmother wasn&#39;t the same at the end and couldn&#39;t really do anything. I&#39;m so glad you have the photos and her writing to keep her memory alive.</p>

      <p>I missed your posts, really 🙂 I know I&#39;ve told it before, but I just love your writing style ^^</p>
<p>And those Cinnamon toasts sound terrific! </p>
<p>We don&#39;t have Earth Balance (which I&#39;d like to try) here in Spain, but I&#39;ve bought some olive oil margarine that would go very well with this (I know, I know&#8230;for some of you it&#39;s a kind of sacrilege to don&#39;t use real butter, but being vegan is that or oil. Wich is tasty too, by the way :P)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think I&#39;ll wait until I&#39;m able to run (damn shin splints) so I can burn some of the extra calories 😉</p>
<p>And I&#39;m sorry about your grandmother. But you&#39;re right: at least now she can rest. My grandmother died four years ago on 8th March. </p>
<p>My mother got an e-mail from Russia, but she couldn&#39;t read anything because of the wrong codification (cyrilic). <br />She supposed they were wishing a happy Women&#39;s Day to her. </p>
<p>Month later, she discovered the e-mail was about her mother&#39;s death. She missed the funeral (we live in Spain) and felt very depressed because she couldn&#39;t see her before she died.</p>
<p>So it&#39;s important that at leat you could be next to her 🙂</p>
<p>PS: Sorry for the long comment 😛</p>

      <p>This strikes me as one of the simplest, most beautiful posts I have read in quite a while. I am sorry for your loss but I also understand the relief. And, as I&#39;m sure you know, the best way to remember is to keep the memory alive, and I can&#39;t think of a better way to do that than with food.</p>

      <p>lovely post&#8211;i&#39;ve missed reading them.  so sweet about your grandmother.  she does indeed have killer hair in that photograph.  her recipe box is lovely too, and i agree that there&#39;s something wonderful about old recipes and cookbooks.  i love perusing my grandmother&#39;s stash from the 60s and 70s, even if the recipes themselves are somewhat dubious casseroles involving ground beef, or gelatin molds garnished with miracle whip.</p>

      <p>I lost my mother last year and finding the cookbooks and recipes&#8230; well it just makes you feel like they live on in flavors and memories&#8230;revivified, actually. It is a beautiful thing to inherit&#8230; and to think, one day you can share them with your child!  Great recipe for the toast&#8230; I imagine tea with that right now!</p>

      <p>Oh, Molly,</p>
<p>I have been thinking about you ever since you wrote that your grandmother was not doing well. </p>
<p>My grandmother was Nanny too.  My friend Polly had a Nanny.  We always say &#8220;Nannys are the best.&#8221;  How lucky for you to have had one.</p>
<p>My Nanny was also ready to &#8220;go&#8221; when her time came.  She always said she was going to live unti she was 150.  One night, when she was the last of her generation left, she was staying with me, and I happened to hear her saying her prayers. </p>
<p>&#8220;OK, God.  I was only kidding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing these notes about yours &#8211; and her recipes!  Those cinnamon toasts sound like a treasure.  I&#39;m going to make them &#8211; right after I make your blueberry bundt cake.</p>

      <p>Hello Molly,<br />  I was so amazed to read that you called your grandmother Nanny!  We called mine that too,  but I never heard or read of anybody else who did.  Your post made me cry.  So good that you have so many wonderful memories of her, and that she left onle once she was ready.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m so sorry for you loss, Molly. The recipe books looks fabulous, I am sure it will keep many memories alive. I&#39;m too keen to try the recipe; it seems to be quite simple and am sure rather delicious. I just purchased a copy of your book when I was on vacation in NYC, I&#39;m back in Kuwait now and I cant wait to start reading as soon as I&#39;m done with my reading material for school.</p>

      <p>That recipe box &#8211; what a treasure! I have an old ledger that was designed for keeping household accounts that has recipes from my mother&#39;s side of the family, filled with the tried and the true. You can almost feel the ladies looking over you when you use it&#8230;a chance to learn cooking in their kitchens again.</p>

      <p>Hello from one of your readers, first time commenter &#8212;<br />your post about your grandmother was beautiful and the photo and recipe box is a lifetime tribute to her.  I have to say the only way  I made and loved cinnamon toast was simplly toasting bread<br />(sometimes raisin bread), apply butter and watch it melt, sprinkle a mixture of sugar and cinnamon.<br />I look forward to your posts.<br />Best wishes,<br />bg</p>

      <p>Welcome back!  I&#39;ve missed your posts.</p>
<p>The cinnamon toast sounds great!  When we were in upstate Michigan for a vacation, we stopped by Trenary Toast.  It&#39;s a shop that does nothing but make a very crisp baked bread.  We were fascinated that anyone could make a business of just toast, but the product was undeniably delicious.  <a href="http://www.trenarytoast.us/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.trenarytoast.us/</a></p>

I am so sorry to hear about your Grandmother, but thank you so much for sharing her story and recipes! My grandmother used to make me cinnamon toast when I had trouble sleeping, so your recipe brought back lots of memories! Thank you!</p>

      <p>Did you find a recipe for &#8220;Phyllis Dip&#8221;? I am so curious to know what Phyllis Dip is. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Pepperidge Farm bread is a good thing; I wish they sold it out here. The Cook&#39;s Illustrated best recipe for grilled cheese sandwich (I know&#8211;grilled cheese sandwich, who needs a recipe, right? But this recipe taught me to brush on melted butter and used shredded cheese) also calls for PF white sandwich bread.</p>

      <p>So sorry to hear about the loss of your grandmother, but I&#39;m happy to know you are relieved she is no longer suffering.  We have my husband&#39;s grandmother&#39;s recipe box, which I love because she wasn&#39;t much of a cook.  She has a recipe for how to make Constant Comet tea.  Someday I hope to frame it.</p>

      <p>Welcome back and thanks for the lovely grandmother post. There must be a Cinnamon Toast vibe in the air when you and thepioneerwoman both post about it&#39;s lure in the same week.  Some pleasures are widespread and timeless.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m so sorry about your grandmother. Cleaning out someone&#39;s belongings after they&#39;ve passed is such a beautiful, difficult, bittersweet type of thing. <br />I&#39;m so glad you got her recipe box (which is ADORABLE!), and can keep such a personal little part of her with you to recreate.<br />I&#39;ll have to try those cinnamon toasts&#8211; yum!</p>

      <p>I inherited two things when my grandma passed away. I was 17. This sounds silly, but I got her &#8220;Diamond Deb&#8221; nail file (it&#39;s classy) and, of course, her wooden recipe box. All recipes written out in longhand on little cards. Bishop&#39;s Pie. Teresa&#39;s Spaghetti. Rice Pudding. It&#39;s such a treasure to me, and I&#39;m sure yours is a treasure to you. It&#39;s like she&#39;s there cooking with you when you make the cinnamon toast.</p>

      <p>It&#39;s great to have you back, Molly. Withouth fail, EVERYtime I read one of your posts I want to drop what I&#39;m doing immediately and make the latest dish you write about. You have a gift for reminding me that cooking and baking are so joyful when done with love instead of approaching new recipes with the same trepidation I might reserve for dangerous chemistry experiments. Thank you for sharing these gems from your grandmother and your other delightful family members!</p>

      <p>Love this post.  And it&#39;s so cool that you have her recipes!  In many ways, a recipe box is like a diary, a window into the lives of those who&#39;ve gone before us. Can&#39;t wait to make that cinn toast!</p>

      <p>Your cinnamon toasts sound wonderful&#8211;and they&#39;re very similar to a recipe Pioneer Woman Cooks just published. See <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/tasty-kitchen/recipes/breads/cinnamon-toast-the-right-way/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://thepioneerwoman.com/tasty-kitchen/recipes/breads/cinnamon-toast-the-right-way/</a></p>
<p>I&#39;ve printed both of them and plan on trying them as soon as my husband bakes another batch of bread.</p>

      <p>I love the recipe box! Thanks Molly, this post reminds of my own grandmother now passed, and her plethora of odd recipes that were such a part of her generation (the cheesy salsa dip, the baked beans, the &#39;dump&#39; cake). The cinnamon toast is definitely a winner though&#8211;beats Velveeta by a long shot!</p>

      <p>Strange the last post I read from Pioneer Woman was also about cinnamon toast.  A similar recipe except butter only on one side and she was serving it for breakfast.  </p>
<p>I have also got my grandmother’s recipes and my husband’s grandmother’s recipes and even some from his great grandma including a book of recipes by First Lady Mrs. Eisenhower &#8211; absolutely a stitch to read.  And there are some recipes I&#39;ve ear marked to try.  Although I think I’ll skip the one that start by browning a pound of ground beef in a stick of butter.</p>

      <p>I found your blog almost by mistake (as so many great web finds are found). I was link hopping… you know how it is.</p>
<p>I was sorry to hear about your Nanny. I have a Nanny too and, I have to say, they are some pretty special people. </p>
<p>You were so lucky to get her box of recipes. What a treasure. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s smiling and reminiscing while she watches you explore that box. I was also lucky enough to get an heirloom recipe box. It belonged to my husband&#39;s grandmother. I&#39;m  putting a link here because I can tell that you&#39;re a girl who appreciates these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Your blog is beautiful but even more than that I was drawn in by the stories and the exquisite writing. </p>

Secondly, I read your gem of a book on the train going to visit my kids in Chicago&#8230;.I absolutely loved it!  I would sometimes stop while reading it, so I wouldn&#39;t finish it sooner than I wanted to! And thirdly, I adore your blog!  Thanks, Molly!  😀</p>

      <p>So happy you&#39;re back!</p>
<p>My mom has a recipe box that dates back to her early years of marriage. It&#39;s decoupaged (or modge podged, I think she would say) with cut-out photos of food from magazines. Some of the recipes are tucked into individual plastic sleeves.  It&#39;s gotten kind of grody over the years, and I love it.  I&#39;m going to take a photo of it to show you.</p>

      <p>Thank you for sharing that very sweet story.  I love the cinnamon toast idea&#8230; It&#39;s those simple flavors that stand the test of time. You always seem to have bread sugar and butter&#8230;cute</p>

      <p>Glad to have you back! When my grandmother passed away, I inherited her cookie jar (which was always full if chocolate chip cookies) and her recipe box. She didn&#39;t write much down, but her recipe for noodle kugel with apricot preserves was there. I always remember her when I make her kugel.</p>

      <p>Molly, so sorry about your grandmother&#8230;I too have THE EXACT SAME RECIPE BOX from my grandmother! Plus her other wooden box containing only canning and preserving recipes.  I would kill to make her mustard pickles and have them taste the same!  But the notes in her handwritng about the lawn fetes and grange suppers magically make her materialize in front of me-I hope that happens to you too.</p>

      <p>Molly, your Nanny and mine are getting along fabulously. I inherited her boxes last April. They, too, are packed with newspaper clippings, index card recipes, and hand-written menus from her teas and dinner parties. On December 30, 1988 she served seven guests a luncheon of wine, cheese biscuits, creamed dried beef over toast points, cheese grits souffle, curried fruit, relish, vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and crushed peppermint, and ginger cookies. I treasure these menus more than her recipes, and hope to entertain with as much class as our grandmothers.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m so glad you are back Molly.  Your absence spoke louder than posts would have about what you were dealing with.  While you were gone I picked up your book, which I LOVE, and started a blog of my own with a Weight Watchers focus (<a href="http://wwfoodie.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://wwfoodie.wordpress.com/</a>). Anyway, I have some of my great grandmother&#39;s recipe cards and they are such a treasure.  Even though most of them are things we wouldn&#39;t eat today.  I can just see her using them.  Thank you for sharing with us and I hope you are feeling peaceful.</p>

<p>Your Nanny&#39;s recipe for cinnamon toast sounds like such a simple, comforting dish. In the already-outdated children&#39;s books I grew up with, there was always a grandmother or a governess or a friendly neighbor lady who kept a batch of zweiback in the cookie tin; though I never tasted the stuff as a child, I always imagined this storybook zweiback was just exactly how you describe your Nanny&#39;s cinnamon toast. </p>
<p>Take care.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m sorry to hear about your nanny.  Touch wood I have not yet lost anyone close to me (grandparents were overseas and never known to me), but I do imagine losing someone who has lived a long and happy live and lived to a grand old age, is somehow easier and more as it should be.  What riches to be left too, so, so precious.  Of all the things I would want of my own parents, the books, the recipes, those are the most prized.</p>

      <p>My very first time making a comment on your site.  Of all things&#8230;I never thought that a post was going to get me on two profound subjects:<br />My dearest Nonna who we finally had to let go at a very young 95 years of age and cinnamon toast!!!<br />It brought it all back.  Something so simple&#8230;yet many memories attached.  If, I&#39;m not mistaken, I think she also added a spot of nutmeg.<br />I will save your recipe since I know my Nonna most probably would not have had this on paper ;0(<br />Thank you for sharing,<br />Claudia</p>

      <p>Welcome back Molly!<br />I&#39;m sorry to read about your grandmother but having her recipes is such a wonderful link between the two of you, apart from the memories you shared that you&#39;ll always have. Seeing the photo of your grandmother I couldn&#39;t help but notice that you look a lot like her!<br />I&#39;ll definitely make the cinnamon toast. It sounds delicious.<br />Magda</p>

      <p>Moly, I&#39;m sorry for your loss. I&#39;m sure no-one would have cherished her recipe box more than you. I made these &#8220;cinnamon toast cokies&#8221;.I went a bit heavy on the sugar, I think, because I had to put some more in my bowl for the last pieces of bread, and then overbaked a bit, but it was a huge success, and I loved it even straight form the oven! thank you for sharing your grandmother&#39;s recipe with us. xxx</p>

      <p>Thanks for sharing this- what a lovely rememberance.  I also kept my grandmother&#39;s recipe box when she passed away a few years back, as well as a couple of her travel journals and her home ec. notebook from high school.  I love looking through the housekeeping tips and recipe cards in her handwriting.  Her journals are especially good; she was very matter of fact about things.  The day when she got engaged to her second husband reads something like &#8220;Had lunch downtown and got my hair done.  In the evening, got engaged to Ray.&#8221;</p>

      <p>What a nice surprise to see a new post from you!  Sorry to hear about your grandmother.  I still have one of mine&#8230;she is 93 and is still the best cook!!  She still lives in her own home.  Unfortunately, we lost my grandfather, her husband last summer.  He was 96, fell while walking to the bathroom and died of a head injury.  On a different note, I love, love, love, The Nibbler recipe.  It&#39;s like a life lesson, all wrapped up in a simple little recipe.</p>

      <p>Seems like one of those recipes that you can make without planning, because you have all the ingredients already. It&#39;s perfect for those nights when you don&#39;t have any dessert and you need dessert (and I often need dessert). </p>

      <p>I really enjoyed this post Molly. I&#39;ve got a recipe book that my great-grandmother wrote, and it really cracks me up to try things like her &#39;Russian Cream Loaf&#39; among other completely alien-sounding recipes. It&#39;s a great way to feel connected to people who are gone (or who in my case I never knew!)</p>
<p>I can picture a bunch of young couples enjoying Nibbler and cocktails over a game of Bridge back in the day (assuming your grandmother was anything like mine!) It&#39;s a nice thought, and a lovely tribute.</p>

<p>About the hair, how the heck did they DO that back then? If I have a full day, you can&#39;t pay my enough money to blow dry; yet these ladies had broods of children running around and picture perfect finger waves. Awesome.</p>

      <p>Molly, when you left to tend to your grandmother, I went out and bought your book. So while you were gone you were still here.  I have my husband&#39;s mother&#39;s recipes and have become the family go-to for her specialties. After my grandmother died and I searched for years for her way of doing things, I knew to take my mother-in-law&#39;s recipes. When I go to estate sales I often see the recipe box sitting on a small table with a ridiculously low price on it, and I take that, too, so someone will remember.</p>

      <p>Welcome back Molly, you were missed.  Sorry to hear about your grandmother, I hope the rest of your family is doing well.  <br />Sometimes, the old recipes are just the best.  I can see it now.  During the week, some of the ladies would get together for coffee and these cookies would appear.  &#8220;Oh no, I couldn&#39;t possibly, well, maybe just one.&#8221;  😉</p>

      <p>Molly, I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re back. Thanks for your wonderful post. I love that you get to keep your Grandmother&#39;s recipe box. I LOVE the old recipe boxes, hand-written. I have a few as well from my Grandma and her sisters. They&#39;re great. You will keep her memory (and recipes) alive!</p>

      <p>My grandma passed away on the 14th. At the funeral/wake I saw pictures of her that I&#39;d never seen before, including one of her and my grandfather that is very &#8220;Hollywood&#8221;. It made me sad to realize how much I never knew (will know) about her. I&#39;m currently coveting an old, weird cookbook she had, hoping that the family will relinquish it to me. </p>
<p>Mine too was ready to go and I&#39;m glad she&#39;s at rest, those last few years were hard on us all. The funeral and the day leading up to it were a celebration of the life she led and the life she created with dogs and great-grandchildren running around, pork shoulder tacos with pickled red onions, red wine, a walk at dusk along a hidden lake, and a house brimming with light and life. </p>
<p>Thanks for sharing and letting me share.</p>

      <p>I adore your grandmother&#39;s recipe box. I still have a little file folder with recipes jotted on paper and some torn from magazines, but my email folder is far more full.  It&#39;s a little sad.  When I was growing up my mom had this great 3 ring binder full of notes and recipes.  It was blue. I wonder if it&#39;s still around. I&#39;ll be here patiently waiting to hear how your Nibbler turned out : )</p>

      <p>I am new to your blog, but I am sorry for your loss.  How sweet that you have her recipe box and that you have shared some of its delights with us.   </p>
<p>The enthusiasm for fruitcake doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.  That generation and the one before it were wild about it back when everyone made it at home.  It was the horrid commercial fruitcakes that ruined its reputation, imo.  I make it with my mother&#39;s recipe &#8211; she&#39;s probably the same age as your grandmother &#8211; and well-made, homemade fruitcake  without skimping on ingredients is out-of-this-world delicious.  Some people rant and rave about it, but I have noticed the the true fruitcake fans don&#39;t say much.  They are too busy eating it and they don&#39;t want to have to share.</p>

      <p>Just finished your book which I enjoyed a great deal.  I&#39;m sorry to see you&#39;ve lost someone precious to you.  I, too, have recipes from my mom and my MIL, who have both passed away.  Sadly, that&#39;s as far back as my handwritten recipes go; I&#39;m happy to hear that your Nanny&#39;s have found a good home where they&#39;ll be appreciated.  <br />Now&#8230;.the cinnamon toast.  It sounded so old-fashioned and delightful, I tried it today.  If I can keep my hands off them long enough, I&#39;ll see if I agree that they get better with age!  Wow&#8230;.crunchy, sweet cinnamon toast&#8230;..They were&#8230;well, are since I did finally put the tin away so I&#39;d STOP eating them!&#8230;.yummy and satisfying and made the whole house smell lovely.  Thank you for sharing your recipe&#8230;..I can&#39;t wait to try some from your book.</p>

      <p>I picked up your book about a month ago before vacation.  What a treat!  Now I&#39;m catching up on your blog by going through it from the beginning.  It&#39;s fun to see where you started since I know where you&#39;ve ended up.  I&#39;m sorry for the loss of your grandmother.  I read that posting the day we got back from visiting my 100 yr old grandmother.  I too will feel relieved when she goes, and will make some snickerdoodles in her honor. Or maybe some cinnamon toast since that appears to be easier and just as delicious.  Thank you for sharing.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly, </p>
<p>I&#39;m new here too&#8211;I just finished reading your book this weekend (well, started and finished. I couldn&#39;t put it down!) and tonight I made your friend Doron&#39;s chicken meatballs and your radish/radicchio/endive/avocado/feta salad. Both recipes made so much food that my husband and I had to call for reinforcements&#8211;a foodie emergency, as we say. We had our friend Wendy over for an impromptu dinner and all three of us loved everything! Thanks for sharing such good food, and also for giving us an occasion to open our home and break bread with a friend. This spontaneous entertaining is something I want to do more of, and I can&#39;t wait to try more of your recipes.</p>

      <p>Molly, thanks so much for this post. I am sorry about Nanny. My prayers are with you and your family. Ironically, my Grandma passed away four days after Nanny and I too was comforted with the thought of her reuniting with my Grandpa after being seperated by death for 24 years. <br />Also, I am reading your book right now and LOVE it. Thanks for writing it. 🙂</p>

      <p>My Grandmother ran a bed and breakfast, I still have a few recipes that she typed up and mimeographed for guests.  I have her copies, and they are stained and covered in her fancy script notes.  She died when I was fourteen, but I feel like she is sitting at the counter when I read and use one of her recipes.  What a prize that recipe box is- it&#39;s like she gets to be with you in your kitchen every time you open it.</p>

      <p>What a wonderful legacy your grandmother has left for someone like you who will totally appreciate each and every recipe.  Snickerdoodles are my son&#39;s (he&#39;s 19) all time favorite cookie (I&#39;d be glad to share the Ladies Home Journal recipe from the 1980&#39;s!)so I can&#39;t wait to surprise him with these cinnamon toasts.

All the stuff, you never think about that, and then they&#39;re gone, and it&#39;s there. Going through it when my mom died was very cathartic, I think. I kept her library card and it makes me smile because I remember how important it was to her. That as an uneducated immigrant, she learned to read, and went to adult night school to get her high school diploma. Stuff like that.<br />Anyway, you wrote about it beautifully. I hope you are doing okay.<br />And, will definitely try the cinnamon toast.</p>

      <p>So, alright, I do cook. I have made a few dishes after your recipes. But as my first ever comment I feel compelled to say that, before having read this particular post &#8211; I had the Nibbler eralier this afternoon! <br />How small is the world..<br />(However, I did not mix the magic ingredients but grabbed the one and the other from separate bowls. I will try the mixed version another day for sure.)</p>
<p>It does not take much to make me comment.<br />That said, I have read your culinary (and otherwise) diary since early spring of 2007 when I accidentally found it via the Duch Baby Pancakes post and have been spellbound by your writing ever since.<br />Reading about your Paris-period, I did not even dream of living in France myself. But then, in 2008, I did. And it was terrific.</p>
<p>In yourself I see now a more at ease, a settled down person writing. I love the fact that I have grown throughout these years so much as well.<br />It is great to look back once in a while, yet persistently keep the eye on the future.</p>
<p>I hope you read all the lengthy comments. No reply required though.<br />🙂</p>

<p>I understand very well that feeling of relief, and I&#39;m so glad your Nanny is out of pain. The recipe box! What a treasure. I was up visiting my grandmother about a month ago and looking through her recipes, and found one my best friend and I gave her when we were 14, complete with ridiculous doodles 🙂</p>
<p>I&#39;m so very happy to see you back here. And congrats! I noticed via The Blue Hour that you&#39;ll be part of the &#8220;Lines and Shapes&#8221; book coming out. Between you and Brian, I will certainly be picking it up. Hope you have a chance to enjoy spring now!</p>

      <p>I wish you well, and I know what you mean about feeling that our loved ones are sometimes just waiting for it to end.</p>
<p>My grandma died of cancer six years ago, and although I still miss her terribly, I get to think fondly of her whenever I make strawberry jam, or kale soup, or mustard pickles, or any of the other things I once loved cooking and learning about with her.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hope you are able to take some time to go through your grandmother&#39;s recipe box, trying new things, remembering old dishes, laughing, and crying when necessary.</p>
<p>We&#39;re all thinking of you out here!</p>

      <p>First, I want to say I love your book &#038; love your blog.  Being cute and funny AND being able to cook is most certainly a blessing. 🙂<br />Second, I too lost my grandmother recently.  My grandfather passed only 2 weeks later of a heart attack.  Or as I tell people, literally of a broken heart.  We&#39;re still trying to get everything sorted out.  But the day after he passed, we were hanging around his house and I found my grandmother&#39;s recipe box.  I am sure you agree what a comfort it is to be able to make those old, delicious recipes as a sort of homage to your loved ones who have passed.<br />In fact, I am planning a whole dinner around the memory of my grandmother that I can feed to all 5 of her surviving children, her grandchildren, her sister and her great-grandchildren.<br />Take care, Molly!</p>

      <p>Hello Molly,<br />we met at the Brookline Booksmith, which was a WONDERFUL book party. I am such an excited reader if your book and blog. </p>
<p>I am terribly sorry to hear about your grandmother. I am anticipating a similar event in our family, the lack of surprise does not seem to make the transition any easier. </p>
<p>I haven&#39;t made the cinnemon toast yet, but it is certainly a recipe I will keep in mind. </p>

That is 6 kids for you!<br />Happy cinnamon toasting~I am going to make this for my girls~for breakfast, even!</p>

      <p>Oh no. you didnt. this looks like it may be the death of my family. Thanks for posting it, but Im telling you &#8211; I may need rehab. This looks charming and beautiful. I wonder what kind of meetings your grandmother had, while serving coffee. I have a feeling I need to have more of those. Makes me want to be a suffragette. And I have a hankering for your apple cake/tart recently. Its another family favorite!</p>

      <p>Your post made me think of my grandmother&#39;s recipe book, which I inherited, and which is filled with all kinds of recipes that never came out of her Jewish kitchen &#8211; chiffon pie, jello salad, tuna casserole. I decided that the recipes that one clips out are often more representative of the cook you want to be than the cook that you are &#8211; she wanted to be a 1950s all-American housewife and mother. It&#39;s sweet to see that side of her, one I never knew existed. But the recipes that the family most loves, remembers, and craves &#8211; blintzes, latkes, breaded veal chops &#8211; aren&#39;t in her books &#8211; she had them in her head and so didn&#39;t need to write them down. <br />And so, they&#39;re lost with her.</p>
<p>Good to meet you in Portland, Molly (dinner at Higgins). I think of you almost every time I brush my teeth. 🙂</p>

      <p>Hi Molly, </p>
<p>My thoughts have been with you since your last post, saying that you were heading home to be with your family. <br />My great-grandma passed away a year ago this Thursday, and like you, I came back home with an envelope filled with old pictures, and a recipe box. I am not only reminded of my grandma when I look through it, but my grandpa too, as he would type out recipes for my grandma on his old manual typewriter. <br />She didn&#39;t have a recipe for Nibbler in there, but there was always a bowl of it sitting on the little side table she had filled with glass bowls of candies and such. I always loved the salty-sweet of the peanuts and the raisins together. <br />As I come to the one year anniversary of my grandma&#39;s passing, I&#39;m fortunate to be reminded me of all the wonderful times I had with her, and the love of food that she passed on to me. I hope that at this time next year, you are reminded of the same. <br />All the best, Molly.</p>

      <p>Hello Molly, I have followed your blog for a while now and I love to come back time and time again to read up on your stories and lovely recipes. I am very sorry to hear about your grandmother, she is at peace now and that&#39;s all that matters. Your post really touched me as I lost my mother very suddenly in mid-March, she was only 65. I&#39;ve been trying to find the strength to write something about her but it&#39;s too raw. This will inspire me to start, at least, thinking about it. Thank you for bringing a bit of sunshine into my culinary life.</p>

      <p>What a wonderful inheritance, and a way to always remember her as you sit down with your coffee or tea, and how special to learn something new at the end of it all.</p>
<p>When my mother-in-law passed, I inherited some of her necklaces, big chunky things that I wear at my store. I get compliments on them, which lets me get to tell stories about her to customers.  Just think about how you&#39;re going to get to talk about Nanny every time you serve Cinnamon Toast.</p>

      <p>Glad to have you back, Molly!</p>
<p>I&#39;m still loving your Spilled Milk podcasts, they crack me up.</p>
<p>When my grandmother was undergoing chemotherapy, she wrote down all of her favorite recipes in a notebook.  Recipes we would all remember from family gatherings.  My mother copied all of the recipes, put them in binders, and gave them to the grandchildren the first Christmas after she passed.  I am so grateful to my grandmother for that.  Memories of food and family can be so comforting.</p>
<p>Take care,</p>

      <p>Sorry for your loss. That&#39;s wonderful that you were able to have her recipe box, and especially find such wonderful notes and dates. </p>
<p>I have some of my grandmothers clip on earrings that we always dressed up in as children. I wish so much that I had some of her recipes. I have very fond memories of her peach turnovers and pickled peaches made from peaches picked right off her tree and no one has ever found her recipes! </p>
<p>I&#39;ll definitely try the cinnamon toast. I think my son would love it!</p>

      <p>For Christmas last year, my mother gave me my grandmother&#39;s recipe box &#8211; old, red and white metal, battered, well-used and well-loved.  With recipes that include instruction like &#8220;beat the bejesus out of it&#8221;. </p>

      <p>Molly &#8211; nice to meet you at the PCC orientation yesterday. It&#39;s great to put a face to the name. And it reminded me that I hadn&#39;t looked at your blog in a few weeks.  I too inherited a lot of my grandmother&#39;s recipes.  The handwritten notes on 60+ years of newspaper cuttings, friends recipes and family passings-down are invaluable to me. I&#39;m not much &#8220;holding&#8221; my recipes and not sharing.  I have only two in that category.  One of them is my grandmother&#39;s fruitcake recipe.  I grew up on it &#8211; it&#39;s a Christmas tradition in our family.  My mother makes it every year &#8211; 4 weeks before Christmas and it sit in a dark, cool cupboard soaking in port or red wine.  And it&#39;s wonderful!  Dark and moist, it&#39;s full of dates, raisins, nuts and not much of the fake colored fruit that makes people hate fruitcake so vengefully.</p>
<p>Your writing reminds me that there&#39;s a history to our food. Thanks!</p>

      <p>So sorry about your grandmother, Molly. I remember telling my own grandmother how much I was going to miss her when she was gone, and she said, &#8220;You can still talk to me, the way I talk to your grandfather.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I have an unrelated question. How do I print one of your recipes to take into the kitchen, so I can try it?  When I try to copy and paste into Word, I just get code.  Anyone know?  I have been jotting them down but would like a quicker way.  By the way, the roasted rhubarb is out of this world!</p>

      <p>What a beautiful recipe box; what you have is a great family legacy. I recently found my husband&#39;s grandma recipes while doing some Spring cleaning. Every family has its woulda-coulda-shoulda moment, that instant when it realizes an opportunity has been lost forever. My hubby&#39;s grandma is no longer with us but I have fond memories of her teaching me my husband&#39;s family culinary heritage. Keeping this recipe box is as if your grandma would always be around.</p>

      <p>Brilliant, all of it. I too got my grandma&#39;s recipe box &#8211; I love instructions that call for &#8220;butter the size of an egg&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;bake in a hot oven until done&#8221; etc. Some recipes are mere ingredient lists. These cinnamon toasts are wonderful, and I can&#39;t wait to adopt them into our household, even though the people behind them aren&#39;t technically related. Thanks for sharing your Nanny with us.</p>

      <p>Have you ever read E.B. White&#39;s essay &#8220;Afternoon of an American Boy&#8221;? It&#39;s his reminiscence of being a teenager and taking a girl on an afternoon date to the Plaza Hotel for dancing and cinnamon toast. I&#39;ve read the essay more than once over the years, and every time I think <i>cinnamon toast?</i> I can never wrap my brain around how something as simple as cinnamon toast could be worth serving for tea at the Plaza Hotel.</p>
<p>But now I get it. It must have been <i>this</i> kind of cinnamon toast!</p>

      <p>Thank you for the sweet words you shared about your grandmother. I also inherited my grandma&#39;s recipe box, which came with some pretty hilarious finds. I can&#39;t believe my grandma had not one, but TWO different recipes for something called &#8220;Sex in a Pan&#8221;! Sort of bummed I never found that when she was alive as I&#39;m sure we would&#39;ve had a good chuckle.</p>

      <p>The cinnamon toast your grandma made is an Upper Peninsula of Michigan culinary tradition called &#8220;Trenary Toast&#8221;. (there&#39;s a small town called Trenary in the U.P.) Is your grandma of Finnish descent?  It&#39;s a traditional food from Finland called korpu.  Many Finlanders emigrated to Michigan&#39;s U.P. during the 1800s&#8230;</p>

      <p>Made the cinnamon toasts yesterday, and in honor of your grandmother I dipped them in butter. I hid them in my cookie tin overnight and pulled them out this morning for my family. They were a huge hit. Thank you so much for sharing. I will think of your grandma every time I make them.</p>

      <p>It is 9pm on a Monday and I am SO making cinnamon toast! And, I am a huge fan of &#8220;real&#8221; fruitcake. Though I have no idea if your grandmother&#39;s recipe fits the bill, if she served it that often, it must have rocked the house. I&#39;d love to get the recipes if it isn&#39;t a family secret.</p>

      <p>The photograph of your grandmother&#39;s recipe box is lovely, as is your description.  I have my grandmother&#39;s box, and my mother&#39;s, lined up behind my own.  I try to cook from all of them, but I find myself using the recipes that my grandmother handed to my mother, who then handed them to me.</p>

      <p>Your Nanny was a lovely lady, who I got to know quite well over the years of her visits to California.  I can see her face and hear her using the word &#8220;yummy&#8221; to describe something she liked.  Thanks for sharing some of the contents of her recipe box.<br />BTW, I LOVED your book!  Maybe it came to life so much for me because I know most of the family, but I love the style and intimacy of your writing.  A great read!<br />Janie V.H.</p>

      <p>I read your blog for the first time yesterday, after reading your book and making Dutch baby pancakes for dinner.  Today I am making baked cauliflower for dinner.  The cinnamon toast intrigued me so it is baking as I write.  However, and a big however, I hope no one else is as klutzy as I am- I caught the edge of the pie pan on the oven and put butter all over the floor.  The smell of the toasts baking is well worth the time scrubbing the floor!</p>

      <p>The cinnamon toast is in the oven as I write this.  The hardest part is getting the ratio of butter and sugar on the pieces evenly.  My first slices are drenched and thoroughly sugared, while the last pieces are very obviously the ones that look a little dry and lacking sugar.  The house smells lovely, though&#8230;can&#39;t wait to try them!</p>

      <p>It&#39;s strange. I happened upon your blog because I just started one of my own after my grandmother passed away last month, April 11th. Then one of my best friend&#39;s grandfathers passed away the day after and suddenly two more friends had grandparents pass that week. And you&#39;re grandmother passed. It makes me think the planets or stars or something were aligned and for whatever reason, grandparents all over felt is was the right time to go&#8230;..</p>
<p>I love when you write about your grandmother&#39;s  recipe box and the cinnamon toasts. I can&#39;t wait to make my grandmothers recipe for ginger ale jello mold with canned fruit. </p>

      <p>My grandmother died recently as well &#8211; March 29th. She was an amazing woman, who struggled briefly with cancer, who I am so proud to represent still in this world 🙂 I have a Blue Ribbon cookbook of hers from 1962 &#8211; she wrote lists of what she preserved that year.

<p>I&#39;m sorry to hear about your grandma. When my grandma passed away 2 years ago, I was able to have a few of her recipes, a lot of rhubarb things. She made the best strawberry rhubarb pie and I always think of her when rhubarb comes in season. I hope you think of your grandma fondly as you make her recipes 🙂</p>

      <p>What a lovely, touching post about your grandmother. I am sorry for your loss. I am putting together a portrait book with recipes and photographs of my mother in law for all the kids and grandkids so everyone will have some of her favorite recipes.  I treasure the handwritten recipes my grandmother gave me a few years before her death.  I have no doubt that your recipe box will become even more precious to you as time passes.</p>

      <p>Shannon, 325 is the correct temperature, and as long as your oven is running accurately, 25 minutes should be just about right.  Maybe try setting the timer for 20 minutes, though, and checking them then.  Mine are usually perfect at 25 minutes, but you might like yours a shade lighter.</p>

<p>I just found your blog and LOVE it!!! I wanted to share with you that I too have recieved some recipes from my Grandmother and Great Grandmother that make me giggle. Mostly because at the end of the instructions it says stuff like &#8220;delectable&#8221; and &#8220;luscious&#8221;. Why don&#39;t we use adjectives like that anymore? I&#39;m going to start a trend&#8230;..</p>

      <p>I really enjoyed this post and will definitely try the cinnamon toasts!</p>
<p>This reminded me of a great vacation we took a few years back. We rented an old house in Vermont. The current owner&#39;s aunt had lived in the house and had two old recipes boxes like your grandmother&#39;s. I spent hours looking at every single recipe. Some were handwritten in beautiful old-fashioned cursive with a fountain pen&#8230; others were typed on a typewriter. The best, though, were newspaper cut-outs from the 1930&#39;s! Absolute gems. The recipe boxes were as beautiful as the scenery.</p>

      <p>Thought you might like to know that I just found and read and enjoyed this blog post after doing a google search on uses for stale bread.  This blog post was linked in someone else&#39;s blog listing 18 things to do with stale bread (or something like that)&#8230; This stood out by far as the best choice. 🙂  I&#39;ve got cinnamon toasts toasting in the oven as I write.  And I really enjoyed your post honoring your grandma and the snipits from the past.  I just thought I&#39;d post as I&#39;m always wondering how stangers happen upon my blog.  I know nothing else about you or your blog but I&#39;m super excited to try the cinnamon toasts, so thanks for sharing!</p>

      <p>I just found this recipe after trying to find a recipe that might appeal to my  teenager to eat breakfast before school, because she won&#39;t eat anything. It&#39;s her last year of school, she needs brain food for the forthcoming exams. Sorted! she loves them. Only problem is there nae enough sugar and cinnamon for 6 slices of bread but then maybe loaves in Scotland are much bigger than the American counterparts! For a good wee warburtons loaf, increase by half again!</p>
