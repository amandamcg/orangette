					<description><![CDATA[My Dad passed away 6 years and 5 months ago - and I find that the longer time goes by, the larger the space between the hills and valleys of my grief, but the valleys are still there, and when they do show themselves, it is still devastatingly painful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your posts in which you remember your father are beautiful. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have two small kids- who will also never know my father he&#039;s been dead almost 10 years...but something has happened this year, my three year old started asking about him...again and again and again. Daily sometimes more than daily I find myself answering her questions and talking about him. And without any experience of PawPaw she knows him...she knows that narrative and web of our family in a way I never could have anticipated. ]]></description>
