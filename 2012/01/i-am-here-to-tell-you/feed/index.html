					<description><![CDATA[I make a similar granola (recipe from New York Times recipe from Eleven Madison Park Restaurant in NYC; however, I use 3 cups organic rolled oats, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup Mediterranean Blend Olive Oil, 1/3 cup maple syrup, 1 cup raw pistachios, 1 cup raw pumpkin seeds, 1-1/2 cup organic coconut shards (from Trader Joe&#039;s),  1 cup raw almonds,  1 cup dried, chopped cherries, 1 cup dried, chopped apricots.  I get rave reviews from friends fortunate enough to eat some that I bring to work or those that order from me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is seriously my new fave go-to granola recipe! I&#039;ve made it three times now and love the saltiness. Once before, I ran out of maple syrup so I subbed in some honey and it was equally as delicious. I love eating it with goat yogurt. Thanks so much!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have made a similar delicious granola for years but never with olive oil.  That is a great tip.  I also use a mix of rolled oats, barley and rye.  All really heart healthy and add a complexity to just rolled oats.  I do the same thing when I cook rolled oats for hot cereal.  A batch of granola is in the oven now with olive oil.  Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This may last one month but it won&#039;t! It&#039;s addictively good. The salt makes it a bit savory as well as sweet. I agree that it was a bit too sweet as written. I cut back on the maple syrup, as I didn&#039;t have much left after the first batch, and also the brown sugar, to about 1/4 cup syrup and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Yum!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m here to tell you, more than a year after you shared this that I made this today and I am in love. You are absolutely right, it crackles in my mouth and lends a robust sweetness. I only used 1/2 cup of maple syrup though and found that to be plenty. Your words always convince me to make the recipes that you share and none of those recipes have failed me. You&#039;re the best Molly!]]></description>
