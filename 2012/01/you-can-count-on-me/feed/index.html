					<description><![CDATA[I finally got around to making these for an annual Christmas cookie exchange that I do with my friends.  Amazing!  They kind of remind me of chocolate-covered pretzels, a Christmas cookie tray standby in my family, but these are so much better.  Thanks for the recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made these yesterday for a business meeting and hubby declared they are the best cookies I ever made. I used whipping cream instead of milk, left the dough in the fridge for a day and then rolled them into logs and into the sugar. Baked only for 8 minutes and they are divine today! Keep the recipes coming!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada!&lt;br /&gt;Nicole]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little late in the game, but I also have the soft dough problem, and I think the issue is that I did not let the chocolate cool much before making the batter.  I had all the other ingredients ready.  I think maybe letting the melted chocolate cool a lot more would help if you&#039;re following the recipe to a T.  But I&#039;m not going to worry because according to all your helpful posts, I can just throw it in the fridge and let it firm up :)]]></description>
