					<description><![CDATA[I have an identical twin sister and we are totally going to be those old twin ladies with matching pocket books, and matching crazy hats!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So sorry for your loss.  My niece thinks of me as her 2nd momma, so I know how close you must have been to your Mom&#039;s duplicate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel sorry for your Mom too, because I don&#039;t know if I would want to be the one left alone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Molly, I&#039;m so sorry to hear about your aunt! Tina was such a wonderful, loving person and without her the world will be a poorer place. Please give my deepest condolences to your mother and your cousins. &lt;br /&gt; Sending all my love to you, Toni, Brandon, your extended family, and your bundle of joy. I hope that someday we will all have the chance to see our loved ones once more. But in the meantime, keep them alive through stories and in memories.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post really hit home for me ... Last year my mother died, May 29th a beloved pet of mine died of old age &amp; I also listened to Maurice Sendak&#039;s comments on Fresh Air many times. I lost my father when I was a very young child, so when my mother died the impact was very different &amp; really made me focus on my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like most, want to believe that we get to see all our loved ones again ... After we die.  Beyond anything this is my hope about death. Reading your post is somehow comforting in that I&#039;m not alone in hope when dealing with loss. So thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed you back when your header was this lush orange chocolate image ... So imagine my happy surprise to read you will be a mom soon!  Congratulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onward with life ... And a new one!]]></description>
