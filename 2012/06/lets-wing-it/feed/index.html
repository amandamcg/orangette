					<description><![CDATA[This is so wonderful. It&#039;s officially on our weekly rotation. I make it a little more rich by subbing the broth for coconut milk. Recently threw in green beans from previous night&#039;s dinner and it was an excellent addition. We always use a ton of lime juice, usually one lime per person, and loads of basil. Thank you so much for sharing!]]></description>
