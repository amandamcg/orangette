					<description><![CDATA[Okay, so: really late to get in the commenting game on this post, but nevertheless: I have just made these (also without the quick-cooking oats, as we do not have them in Denmark, where I live), but as I did not have peanut butter on hand, I substituted it for sesame paste. I tentatively tried the batter, and the sesame taste was really overwhelming, but after baking, it becomes very subtle and lovely. Definitively a recommendation, should any of you be in a similar pinch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We loooove these!  Have made them many times and cobbled them together with dried apricots instead of cherries this time around.  Also had a brain blip and forgot the recipe called for instant oatmeal so used the regular I had purchased.  All was good!  Also used a spare coffee grinder to grind the 1/3 cup oats so I didn&#039;t have to break out the food processor and it worked like a charm.  Another Orangette winner!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s interesting that this recipe doesn&#039;t contain eggs, baking powder or baking soda. Loved the story about your Aunt loving to live in SF. I&#039;ve always wanted to live there. Maybe it&#039;s time.]]></description>
