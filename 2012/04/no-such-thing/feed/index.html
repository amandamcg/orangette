					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, The pistachios on your pound cake look green and fresh.  On the other hand, the ones on top of the cake I currently have in the oven are turning dark and I&#039;m just a little over half-way through the cook time at a temp of 325.  Did you put your pistachios on the cake at the beginning?  I&#039;m starting to think that perhaps I should have toasted them separately and added them when the cake comes out of the oven.  Just curious.  By the way, it smells divine!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lisa, I don&#039;t know what to tell you!  The original recipe calls for a 9x5 pan, and it worked just fine for me.  My apologies, though, for the mess in your oven!  I hate that that happened, and I wish I knew what to advise...]]></description>
