					<description><![CDATA[So 2 weeks ago I invited some new friends over to our house for lunch this Sunday (March 17, a completely random choice). When the wife rsvp&#039;d, she said &quot;we&#039;d love to come over on St. Patrick&#039;s Day!&quot; I thought it was a little odd that she pointed out that it was St. Patrick&#039;s Day, but I just blew it off. 3 days ago her husband mentioned to my husband how excited he was to hang out with us on St. Patrick&#039;s Day. My husband and I chuckled about how excited they were for a holiday most people didn&#039;t really make to much fanfare over. Especially people who have small children and don&#039;t plan on drinking green beer until all hours of the night. &lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to tonight, when my mom happened to mention how remarkable it was that we were having N &amp; M over on St. Patrick&#039;s Day! And then it hit me. Oh my goodness. We randomly invited a couple whose last name is &quot;Ireland&quot; over for Sunday dinner on St. Patrick&#039;s Day. &lt;br /&gt;I suddenly realized I had inadvertently arranged the most epic March 17th of my life thus far. They would be expecting corned beef (Elise Bauer&#039;s recipe!), cabbage, potatoes, a green grasshopper cake, Murphy&#039;s Irish Stout, and soda bread! How could I forget the soda bread?&lt;br /&gt;I remembered that not long after I had my son, I had made a soda bread that was out of this world. But for the life of me, I couldn&#039;t find  the recipe. Something told me to check Orangette, and all of the memories came flooding back to me as soon as I saw this post. My son Holden was 2 months old and it was the first  recipe I had managed to rally my tired, PPD addled body to make. It was bliss. &lt;br /&gt;So of course, it will be on our epic March 17th menu. Thanks for saving the day! :)]]></description>
