					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re a momma! I have been away from your blog too long. But this makes my heart very happy. 3 yrs. ago I became a mommy and I remember the feeling of disbelief. How can I be the mom? I took comfort in empty-nesters who were so wrapped up in their identity as mom. Maybe someday I would feel this too. &lt;br /&gt;Now I have another little one. So much joy! And day by day I become more into this thing called motherhood and the world is brand new and if I weren&#039;t so sleep deprived I would be grinning nonstop.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations! A whole afternoon to stare at the wall and as a new Mom, boy do you need that right now! You may never feel like a Mom, to be honest. Hold onto that because you will need those banana bread crumbs to keep your writer identity alive through the next few years. Don&#039;t let go! Enjoy and know things are always changing, becoming different, getting better, getting challenging as the task of motherhood consumes most everything at times. May your little one grow strong and lovely!]]></description>
