					<description><![CDATA[Molly, thanks for the great recipe. As you described, they are not the most beautiful of muffins, but tastier and heartier than they look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things of note:&lt;br /&gt;1) I filled my muffin pan to the brim, and had batter left over.  So that&#039;s 12+ muffins.&lt;br /&gt;2) I needed the full 40 minutes of baking time. A clean tester does not work for this recipe, as it will come clean early on even though the muffins are not quite done.&lt;br /&gt;3) This recipe would not work well in a loaf pan, I imagine.  The texture is quite dense; the muffin size is the right balance between outer dry/crunchy crust and inner moist dense muffin.&lt;br /&gt;4) Next time I might consider adding toasted walnuts or millet for crunch.  These muffins might also do well with some sort of crunchy streudel top.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, Molly, I am catching up on your blog and I just had to comment {and say you are wonderful!} I have tears in my eyes but I can&#039;t stop laughing - all your honesty and detail and bird chirps for muffins. It&#039;s just all so beautiful. ]]></description>
