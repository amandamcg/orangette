I imagine you could get away with using a 9&quot; square pan. Try it! When in doubt, I generally lean on conversation charts like &lt;a href=&quot;http://dish.allrecipes.com/cake-pan-size-conversions/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So late to the party, but hoping someone can set me straight on pan size.  I want to make these in a square or rectangular pan so that I can cut them into tidy little squares.  I&#039;m wondering what size would be best to substitute for the 9&quot; springform.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A lot of people take time of from work when they are pregnant. The best thing you can do to increase your productivity is to take care of yourself. When it comes to writing or any type of work your going to have bad days. The worse thing you can do is be hard on yourself because that is not going to help you at all. Taking a break and making rye crumble bars may be the best thing for you. This mental break could just be what the doctor ordered. Let your creativity flow and don&#039;t let any emotional stress ruin that flow.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These bars look so, so good. I love baking with heartier flours.  I think a lot of sources turn people off from it by making a big deal of telling people that anything but AP or cake flour will result in disaster.  While obviously you can&#039;t always do a straight substitution with a whole grain flour for a recipe designed for AP, but many of my friends who are not huge bakers read those admonitions as &quot;baking always means using white flour.&quot;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I&#039;ve never used rye flour in a sweet baked good, and I&#039;m excited to try it.  I&#039;ll make these this weekend.]]></description>
