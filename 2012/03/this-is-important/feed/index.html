					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I had a Bon appetite subscription several years ago.  I loved your column on yeast and cinnamon rolls.  In fact I have always been afraid of yeast too, so when I read your column I was inspired to to try your recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been making cinnamon rolls for about 4 years now - my family loves them and today I am making them for my father because it is his birthday.  When I finished mixing the dough, and set it out to rise I looked at your article and decided to look up your  blog.  I am not a blog follower but because your writing is so delightful I decided to take a peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Every recipe that I looked at sounds delicious.  I hope to try more of your recipes soon.  Thank you for sharing your life and food!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These waffles were a show-stopper! My brunch guests waited enthusiastically with plates in hands as they came off the waffle maker.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used about 1/2C less milk since I have a Belgian waffle maker, and they came out picture perfect.  Apricot jam was a popular topping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;m curious to make them again using less butter in the batter. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh.  These sound amazing.  I must try them.  Actually, when I first discovered your book, one of the many things that endeared it to me was you mentioning The Breakfast Book.  It has, for many years now, been one of my mostest favoritest cookbooks.  I also have The Supper Book, but I am much more interested in breakfast!  And you are pregnant!  Congratulations!  I am horrid at keeping up with blogs.  I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve caught up on yours since around the holidays.  Eek.  Don&#039;t take it personally though, yours is actually one of the few I read with any kind of regularity.]]></description>
