					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, a bundle of congratulations to you and Brandon! I&#039;m waiting with anticipation for your baby... I&#039;m looking forward for her mommy and daddy showering their love  and lots of yummy treats!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my only child 6 years ago and being a late bloomer in almost everything, at times I wished my kid was back in my womb again :-D The feeling of baby&#039;s movement and carrying baby within you wherever you are simply &#039;amazing and mysterious&#039;! Now, I have a &#039;Food Tester&#039;, an eager helper whenever I bake or cook but doesn&#039;t hesitates to say &#039;yuck&#039;  or  &#039;yummy + thumbs up&#039; and at the end of the day, cuddles to you and gives goodnight kisses... &quot;Mommy, I love you so, soooooo much&quot;]]></description>
