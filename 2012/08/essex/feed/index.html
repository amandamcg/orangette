					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly! I&#039;ve been a reader here ever since my mum gifted your first book to me.  At the beginning of September I was visiting friends in Seattle and when someone suggested finishing our night at Essex I was thrilled to go see the place I&#039;d read about here.  We all loved our cocktails and the super friendly bartender made us crack up by playing the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air song as he closed up (he had overheard us throwing it around earlier) -- a great vibe, will definitely return when I&#039;m in Seattle! Thanks:)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a brit who ordered and read your first book after finding it on US Amazon upon it&#039;s launch. In my local pub that stocks only real ale from mainly small breweries, there is a special stool. It belonged to the landlord&#039;s father and upon his death we had a plaque made with his name on for it. Nobody sits there. It has pride of place and was also placed nest to his coffin during the funeral service and at the wake (where it was &#039;baptised&#039; with a half pint of a favourite bitter!). I recently re-read your book as my own father died two months ago. It helped me cry and break the numbness I had been frozen by. Thankyou, June is lovely.]]></description>
