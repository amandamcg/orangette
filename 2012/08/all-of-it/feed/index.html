					<description><![CDATA[You are exceedingly brave to open a new business in this economy.. especially a bar/restaurant.. they can be so tough to get going!  (personal experience and observations)  I wish you all the luck with all of your big changes.  If it were easy.. everyone would have their own business.. it is nice that you will have something you built for yourselves!]]></description>
