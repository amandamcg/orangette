    <p>My host mother used regular orange carrots, but I like to use purple and yellow ones, too, when I can find them. They keep their color when cooked, so they make the dish especially handsome. Whatever carrots you use, make sure that they taste sweet in their raw state: a dull, bitter carrot cannot be fixed. I don’t bother to peel my carrots, but I do wash them well.</p>
<p>Also, for this recipe, I like to slice my onions from stem end to root end, like <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/how-to/how-to-french-cut-an-onion-home-hacks-109536">this</a>, so that they keep their shape and integrity as they cook. When you slice onions the other way – <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/knife-skills-how-to-cut-an-onion.html">across their equators,</a> you could say – they tend to fall apart during cooking.</p>

                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 yellow onion, halved and sliced from root to stem, like this          </div>

                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            2 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            2 lb. carrots, sliced into ¼-inch-thick rounds          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            4 to 5 fresh thyme sprigs          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            ½ tsp. red wine vinegar, or to taste          </div>
                  </div>
  
      <div itemprop="instructions">
      <p>Warm a large skillet over medium-high heat. When it’s hot, add a good amount of olive oil, enough to film the bottom of the pan. Add the onions – they should sizzle – stir to coat with oil. Salt lightly. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are softened but not browned. Add the garlic, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for a few more minutes, until the garlic is fragrant. Add the carrots, thyme, and a couple of generous pinches of salt, and stir to mix. If the carrots look dry, add a little more oil to lightly coat them; this dish needs more oil than you might think. Cover the pan and continue to cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are tender and the onions are very soft. (I never seem to pay attention to how long this takes, but I would guess that it takes somewhere between 10 and 20 minutes.) Remove the pan from the heat, and discard the thyme sprigs. Sprinkle the vinegar over the carrots. Stir gently to incorporate: the vinegar should subtly brighten the flavor of the carrots without being discernable itself. Add more vinegar, if needed, and salt to taste.</p>
<p>Serve hot.</p>
