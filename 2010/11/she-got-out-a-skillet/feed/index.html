					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for this beautiful story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You gave me a good idea for the filling of a meat pie -- with artichokes and this mixture in the filling (as a sort of veggie-demi-glace), and red onions glazed with brown sugar (along with the regular lid-- to add an earthy spiciness to this essence of Corantine&#039;s skillet cooking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sure was a cool thing to come across, as I was rather trying to do an internet search to see if there were any news items about &lt;b&gt;Kraft Foods&lt;/b&gt; using &lt;i&gt;apocarotenol&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; to colour their legacy-turned-Cheese. Gotta love Google-fu.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Best carrot recipe ever!  One little change -- instead of more oil, added a healthy splash of dry-ish white wine after adding the carrots, just the right amount of moisture to prevent drying out.  Never enjoyed carrots this much before - thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Orangette - We MUST have these at least once a week. They are the best ever. It&#039;s true that something very wonderful happens under the lid. I&#039;ve never thought of onions and carrots together, but it is a fabulous combination. Thank you so much for this recipe!]]></description>
