					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m currently at my sister&#039;s and every time  I come over I try to bake something because I know how much they appreciate it since they&#039;re no bakers.  This afternoon I woke up from a nap and went straight to the kitchen. I found 2 bags of chocolate chips so I thought  why not cookies.. It&#039;s  a huge batch but I&#039;m glad I did not make half of it because they will be gone soon  . the last time I was here I made your graham crackers . A hit , both times.
 Cooking is love in my books]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was gathering a list of my favorite recipes from my favorite blogs recently, and this was the first on the list. 1. Because they are so delicious and feel so homey and I have loved them for years now. And almost as importantly 2. Because you Molly, are an inspiration. I love reading your writing, I love your photography and I laugh weekly to you and Matthew on Spilled Milk. Thank you for everything. Keep living the good life!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve made these tons of times and love them. Tonight tried them with 2c spelt flour and 1 c white flour, and replaced the brown sugar with coconut sugar. SO GOOD! I would do the same variation again. Perfect texture.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No, I&#039;m totally with you on the digestive biscuit thing! And I&#039;m also American! I always have a couple with my tea (which usually occurs a couple of hours after lunch). It&#039;s that fabulous whole wheat-y taste! Can&#039;t wait to try these. Glad I stumbled on your blog.]]></description>
