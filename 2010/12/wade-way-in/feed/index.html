					<description><![CDATA[Made these yesterday and they were a big hit

However. mine were a lot thicker as it&#039;s hard to cut without the dough crumbling/my brain exploding. 

I tried to refrigerate 2 batches-  for 2 hours and then overnight. the 2 hour dough actually cut better but I still struggled to get a straight cut (maybe it&#039;s the size of the nibs)

Still delicious. just not as pretty or stackable as yours.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made these yesterday! I have had a lot of flops with sables before, so I may have cut them slightly thicker than a quarter inch, and I only got 24 cookies. BUT they are very good!! Between my roommate and I we have already devoured nearly half, and it&#039;s only been 24 hours. I love canoe nibs, thanks for having all the info I needed about them on your blog!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;These have been on my to-make list for so long but I couldn&#039;t find cocoa nibs. Today I FINALLY came across the Theo nibs so I can&#039;t wait to make these cookies now! Just one question...do you think these would freeze well either in their log shape or after they are sliced? I&#039;m just thinking I prooobably shouldn&#039;t have a whole batch of these just sitting around because, well, you know what happens then.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly my kitchen friend! Just want you to know that my family and I just finished an absolutely outstanding bowl of your Tomato Soup with Two Fennels. It was the best tomato soup I have ever had. Also tasty with homemade rustic bread croutons! I made beloved Burg&#039;s French Toast on Saturday morning, and have a Winning Hearts and Minds Cake in the freezer for my husband and I to enjoy when we celebrate Valentines together :) So yes, I just finished your book that a foodie friend loaned me, and I am so grateful to you both. Most of my family lives in Seattle, (I was brewed in Bellevue ;) ), but now live in Colorado Springs. Can&#039;t wait to make Brandon&#039;s Chana Masala...I miss the wonderful restaurants in Seattle. Pet Rachel the pig in the Market for me! &lt;br /&gt;Love,&lt;br /&gt;Jessie&lt;br /&gt;xxx]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I&#039;ve kept this sable recipe on my to-bake list. Will whip up some once I&#039;ve gotten myself a bag of whole-wheat flour and cacao nibs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love your writing. Keep it up!

					<description><![CDATA[Alright, Molly, you&#039;re a way too busy person, and this is an older post, there is no way you&#039;ll get to my comment, but maybe you&#039;ll somehow sense my excitement when you&#039;re shaping your next piece.  I gasped out loud when I saw that you are working on a piece for Ed Behr&#039;s quarterly. In my book, that is serious props. Kudos on that article, the embryonic book, continuing to blog... I&#039;m so very curious about what you&#039;ll write about for the Art of Eating. If I could frame my (old) copies of the quarterly, I would.  As it is, they reside in a place of honor, not too far from your book.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, I saw the comment about the dough being too crumbly and wanted to say that I had the same problem the first time I made these cookies. I used whole wheat pastry flour, and used the whole 9 oz as the recipe directs, even though it seemed high for 2 cups of whole wheat pastry flour (which is much less dense than other types of wheat flour, so the standard 4 to 4.5 oz per cup doesn&#039;t apply). This time I made them with only 6.75 oz WWP flour using my standard conversion of 3 3/8 oz per cup, and the dough turned out perfectly. So perhaps the earlier poster used too much flour? (I was able to save the earlier batch by pressing the dough into a pan.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your blog is beautiful. Thank you for sharing your cooking with us! I&#039;ve been reading for a while and just wanted to comment on this.]]></description>
