					<description><![CDATA[Sadie, I wish I could help you!  But the only red velvet cake I&#039;ve made didn&#039;t turn out particularly well.  (It called for using the juice from a can of beets instead of red food coloring, and the cake wound up sort of muddy-looking, with a slightly weird flavor.) If I were you, I&#039;d look to see if the people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cooksillustrated.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cook&#039;s Illustrated&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have a red velvet recipe.  (If you aren&#039;t a member of their site, you can sign up for a free trial.)  You might also see what &lt;i&gt;The Joy of Cooking&lt;/i&gt; has in the way of red velvet cake.  Those would be my go-tos!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly/Lady Orangette....I just found out about you last month when I tried your spaghetti sauce and meatballs in Bon Appetite. I&#039;ve made the recipe 3 times now....with the third time baking the meatballs separately....I can&#039;t get over how easy and delicious that recipe has been to use with my home grown and canned tomatoes....when I&#039;ve told friends that there are no herbs or garlic in the sauce...they are confused....doesn&#039;t stop them from enjoying and eating it though ( chuckle). After reading a few entries on your blog...I had to get your book....I LOVE IT...You are my intro lady to the cooking blogs. Thanks for that gift...BUT thank you for a beautiful book. It&#039;s going to take me awhile to get through cooking things you&#039;ve shared. I LOVE the family anecdotal approach....I&#039;m a teacher...of 4th Graders...I&#039;m thinking of having them write a narrative about a favorite dish they love to eat from their family...and then assemble it into a class book. ( Did you think you would inspire writing too ?!!!) Thanks again. Sincerely, Desert Dweller in Phoenix.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the recipe!  Made it for our Labor Day BBQ and our friends loved it.  So simple and yet so satisfying.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I continue to make your banana bread recipe from your book and can&#039;t get over how delicious it is.  The only bad part is that I keep eating the whole loaf myself (not in one day, mind you) which does not do much for my post-pregnancy diet plan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I&#039;m wiping the tears away...I love this story about your friend Hannah!  These are the brand of memories that I want my daughter to have of growing up. Life gets moving too fast ~ for what reward! Thanks for your lesson of the day. We will be having your cobbler this week on our slower path.]]></description>
