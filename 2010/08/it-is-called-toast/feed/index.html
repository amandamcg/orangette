					<description><![CDATA[I just made this recipe this morning and it turned out the fluffiest, tallest, most beautiful loaf of sandwich bread I&#039;ve ever made! I ate about half of it while it was still steamy from the oven, and now I&#039;m going to try to stay away from it so that it lasts until tomorrow (and hopefully a few days thereafter) for breakfast! Thanks so much Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your help! I have tried two of your banana bread recipes... AMAZING. I cannot help but sneaking little nibbles from the freezer every 2 minutes... I think I&#039;ve already stood up 10 times :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hi molly--thought i&#039;d let you know this has become our standard household bread almost since you posted the recipe; i started making our sandwich bread right around that same time and this is my favorite recipe--my kids eat it for breakfast pretty much every day. i wanted to let you know some of the ways i&#039;ve tweaked it, just for the sake of variety: for instance, i use coconut oil in place of the butter, which is fabulous to smell and apparently also very healthful. i always add a few tablespoons of vital wheat gluten, just to give it some extra lift and shape, and i usually substitute a cup or so of another flour just to mix things up: spelt works well, white whole wheat, millet, i&#039;ve even tried coconut flour, which is also awesome in the banana chocolate bread from your book (which, btw. are also scrumptious with blueberries instead of chocolate). anyway, i&#039;ve got a loaf of this stuff rising on my stove right now and suddenly thought, &quot;you should tell molly how much you love this bread!&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so there you go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love toast also and I have made two of your loaves this week and they are delicious.   As an ex-pat brit toast and Marmite is my favorite.   We always ate it when we came home from school.   &lt;br /&gt;Marmite must be introduced to children before the age of 2 - babies in England eat it on toast &quot;soldiers&quot; sitting in their high chairs !]]></description>
