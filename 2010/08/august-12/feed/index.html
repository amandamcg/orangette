					<description><![CDATA[Thank you, thank you, thank you for having been in place long enough for an anniversary! You are SO WISE to be closed two days of the week and take extra days just for specialness. Looking forward to a visit in March 2011!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly,&lt;br /&gt;I am about 3/4 of the way through your book, and I think it is absolutely beautiful.  It&#039;s sad, and hearty, and funny; thoroughly captivating.  I&#039;ve stopped reading momentarily, and am writing now, because I don&#039;t want to get to the end, where it&#039;s all over... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found your book in one of my favorite places, the Tattered Cover Bookstore, while on vacation in Denver, Co.  If you&#039;ve never been, I think you might like it.  They house a rustic cafe which sells a few too many things labeled &#039;vegan&#039;, and &#039;wheat-free&#039;, but their Cookbook section is large, and at the front of the store (not hidden away upstairs).  There, a top a high shelf, your book leapt out at me, and I had to have it.  It looked so completely at home there, at the Tattered Cover, like maybe the author wrote it in the back room, or behind the counter at the cafe.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;m not much of a &#039;foodie&#039; in the cooking sense, though I love to eat and try new things. While I will bake, my husband prepares most of our evening meals.  He&#039;s such a good cook (and by 5:00 I just want to be pampered), that whole weeks will go by and the only thing I prepare in the kitchen is breakfast.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son (Avery, he&#039;s 3) can be a tough breakfast customer; he doesn&#039;t like cereal, only eats eggs once in a while, and calls cheese &quot;dirty&quot; and wants it removed from everything (including pizza).   So, this morning I tried your French Toast recipe with some day-old artisan bread from Jewel, and HELLO, NURSE, was it good.  Avery gobbled it down, barely breathing in between bites.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, congrats... you have hooked another family on the glorious tradition of French Toast a la copious amounts of oil.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for sharing, and best of luck with everything!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have only just discovered your blog this mourning. Apparently I have been living in a shoe box. After reading your latest blog I was a little put off expecting it to be about food, which was not the case. However, I always give things a second chance and often a third. I&#039;m pleased as punch that I did. I find your words to honest and a breath of fresh air. I will now look for you in the mornings along with my New York Times, tea, and toast.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly,&lt;br /&gt;I just love Orangette. I have hundreds of cookbooks and zillions of recipes that I&#039;ve cut out over the years--yet, since finding your blog--you are the go-to for recipes. Your writing is beautiful--and everything we have made is perfect--waffles, pancakes, cakes, everything. Last night it was cornmeal cake--that went in a flash. Tonight&#039;s it&#039;s busy day cake (we had a wonderful thanksgiving once, years ago, at Gage &amp; Tollner when Edna Lewis was still the chef). Then, I saw your post on the Old 97s--who I adore. To top it all off, my husband owns pizza restaurants here in Boston. I keep hoping he&#039;ll announce that we need to do a fact finding trip so we can come to Delancey. Check out Stone Hearth Pizza (www.stonehearthpizza.com).&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;Lisa]]></description>
