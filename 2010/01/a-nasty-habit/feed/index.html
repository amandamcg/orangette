					<description><![CDATA[I loved this mousse too!  It has the perfect mousse texture.  However, I don&#039;t think I am a mousse expert, because I also liked the America&#039;s Test Kitchen mousse (an older recipe), Ina Garten&#039;s Chocolate Orange Mousse, and another mousse recipe, all equally and I could not choose!  I did care much more for the original version of this recipe than the chocolate-orange version (with grand marnier), which tasted pretty weak in the orange department compared to Ina&#039;s version, IMO.  Of course everyone has different taste especially when it comes to chocolate.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also wanted to add that Cook&#039;s Illustrated did make a version just for fancy chocolates that contain a higher percentage of cacao than the 60% Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate that they developed this recipe for.  If you are using a boutique chocolate containing 62 to 70% cacao, simply add 2 Tablespoons of sugar to the chocolate-cocoa powder-espresso powder-water mixture, AND use an extra two Tablespoons of water in the same step.  (I.e., use 5 Tbsp instead of 3 Tbsp).  Also, use 3 large eggs instead of 2 large eggs.  Cook&#039;s Illustrated calls this recipe Premium Dark Chocolate Mousse on their website, but if you read it, it&#039;s just their explanation of how to work with a higher % cacao chocolate, and they explain that they modified the recipe.  Those are the three changes they made (sugar, water, eggs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bon appetit!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, I had high high hopes for this. My chocolate seized! It happened when I added the chocolate to the egg yolks. Unfortunately, it was pretty much impossible to fold the whipped egg whites into the chocolate mixture and my mousse is full of lumps. Just wanted to post my results in case other makes the recipe -- be sure to use room temperature egg yolks and it wouldn&#039;t hurt to temper the egg mixture with a little chocolate to be extra safe. Hope everyone else&#039;s mousse is smooth, creamy and lump-free.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is awesome chocolate mousse, I&#039;ve been making it for four or five years and everyone I serve it to adores it.  I make the version with Chambord.  And have a little glass of Chambord to sip.  A few weeks ago on America&#039;s Test Kitchen they made a three mousse cake, which also looks awesome and I definitely want to try that.]]></description>
