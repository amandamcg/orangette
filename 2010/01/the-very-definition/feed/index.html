					<description><![CDATA[Molly, do you think this would work with quick cooking steel cut oats? I&#039;ve made this the original way many times and have loved them but had the aforementioned oats on hand and was wanting to use those.

Thanks,

					<description><![CDATA[These have become a Sunday tradition, ever since I found this recipe about a month ago (via a link in one of your more recent posts). My two-year-old helps me stir and insists on little faces made of blueberries. My five-year-old jumps up and down with glee when we mention them, and my husband just rejoices, &quot;Pancakes? The new ones? Yeah!!!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Molly!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing your wonderful pancake recipe!  I read it one day, then, that night I couldn&#039;t sleep, so at midnight I got up and started the pancakes by mixing the oats and, I didn&#039;t have buttermilk so I soured some milk and mixed that in.  What a great treat I had in the morning when I added the other ingredients and walaaa....it was a comfort food breakfast for me.  Instead of maple syrup, I piled cooked apples on top of the cake...delicious and nutritious.  Speaking of nutritious, I also added ground flaxseed to the mix.  I think it would be very nice to add chopped nuts to the batter as well. The pancakes remind me of the ones we had at a B and B in southern Utah a few years ago.  YUMMMMO!]]></description>
