					<description><![CDATA[This is my first visit to your site and the first blog of yours I have read. I&#039;m new to the scene but I understand that it is bad etiquette to just read and not comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photos are beautiful, so are your stories. Especially the one you have written between the lines about how you met your husband. That&#039;s so romantic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you]]></description>
