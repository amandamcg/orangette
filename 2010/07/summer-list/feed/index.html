					<description><![CDATA[Mmm...Pimm&#039;s!  I just discovered Pimm&#039;s Cups during my vacation in England.  I had my first one at the Eagle &amp; Child pub in Oxford, and have been drinking it--and blogging about it--since I got home!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;ve been mixing mine with fizzy lemonade, cucumber, strawberries, lemon and lime slices, and mint.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading all the suggestions here in comments, I really think I need to try using ginger ale next.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pimm&#039;s Cup tip:  My favorite Pimm&#039;s Cup in New Orleans right now is at Pal&#039;s Lounge. They use cucumber-flavored sparkling water instead of 7-up or ginger ale. It&#039;s perfect.  I don&#039;t remember the brand name but you can get it at Whole Foods for sure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Molly, I LOVE this post.  We live in Oregon and know firsthand about the July 5th thing. We left for Texas two weeks ago to visit friends and family and I loved almost every second of those 90 degree temps (especially since it was only in the 60&#039;s when we left here) and then we returned yesterday to a beautiful Northwest summer day.  Here&#039;s to the beginnning of our summer in this corner of the world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And your list is perfect by the way.  Perfect!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[thanks for the list... i have a summer drink for you to try.  i recently discover aperol and the &quot;spritz&quot; but when i was in Amsterdam, I had a special spritz -- they filled a wine glass with ice cubes, added a good glug of aperol, a splash of  grand marnier, proscecco, soda and a big squeeze of oj.  Oh my my! have a great summer!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Something about this post made me tear up. Happiness and grand memories can be made from the most simple of pleasures - like lemonade and a great book read on a hot summer night. I have not read a novel in far too long. Thanks for the thoughts - need to make my summer list.]]></description>
