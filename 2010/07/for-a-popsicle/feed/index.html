					<description><![CDATA[My friend Rose gave me your book for my birthday. My father passed away 3 years ago and I love to cook. You touched me deeply. Thank you sooo much! I made your Ed Fretwell soup yesterday for a friend who has a husband in the hospital, your cornbread and berry pound cake. Yummm.&lt;br /&gt;XXX Guusje Sellier]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was looking for something to do with a whole bunch of blackberries and raspberries and these popsicles were just the thing. Shot glasses, yes!, we have those. I especially liked the popsicle we shimmied out of the 5 shot glass. BIG popsicle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotta love stoop culture and fluttering curtains.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The popsicle molds you linked are indeed tupperware molds. They were probably the ones used by your mother as well as many of the commenters.  My mother had a set she obtained from hosting parties in the 1980s. I also recently obtained a second set from my grandmother. She purchased them in the 1960s. Tupperware rarely changes. And what do you know? I saw an updated color version at a home show last Saturday. Unfortunately, it doesn&#039;t seem to be sold on their website. But if anyone is interested, I&#039;m sure you can contact a seller or find it used (or unused as Tupperware products often go) online.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have any popsicle makers shaped like yours, but I am loving fixing popsicles this summer, too. I&#039;ve actually come up with some really easy, but really tasty ones using just fruit juices--the pomegranate and grapefruit ones are especially good. I tried them in the Zoku pop maker--work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love your blog and hope you&#039;ll visit mine some time -- it&#039;s at www.kitchenlane.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ahh yes, we are in the shut phase of summer as hurricane season is starting to get more active.  I will try a milk free version of this recipe to accomodate the allergy we have in our house.  Thanks for the inspiration.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post inspired my own version, based on your recipe: plain yogurt, pitted sweet cherries, and a little dark brown sugar.  It made lovely popsicles with cherry bits throughout.  Thanks for the inspiration!  My ice cream addiction may just have been put on hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica]]></description>
