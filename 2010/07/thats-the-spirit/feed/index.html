					<description><![CDATA[My thermometer says it is 103F outside in The Dalles, Oregon, hot enough for a Pimm&#039;s Cup. Plus I had a bottle of real ginger beer (A.J. Stephens) on hand.  Here&#039;s to you and your great recipe for a very refreshing drink! Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a relative latecomer to your lovely blog and saw your interest in ginger beer with Pimm&#039;s. I have recently been making home made ginger beer and thought I might suggest this very simple recipe if you want to go to a little trouble and can find a good fresh piece of ginger at your market. Blend together in a very clean blender, one 2 inch piece of thinly sliced pealed ginger the juice of two reamed out limes and enough water to liquefy completely. strain into a clean 2 L. soda bottle add a cup of sugar and fill with room temp water leaving a cups worth of space for the yeast and water and shake to dissolve the sugar. I used raw sugar. In a cup of warm water add 1/4 tsp either bread yeast or champagne yeast and a Tbsp. sugar to proof the yeast. Combine the yeast with the ginger lime water and shake with lid screwed on. leave it out on your counter for a few hours checking periodically until in feels as hard as a store bought bottle of soda is then refrigerate over night. you can use it within a day or two. Just don&#039;t open it fast or you will have an overflow. Release a bit of pressure once in a while if it needs it. It is lightly cloudy as the starch from the ginger and some yeast gets a little agitated with the effervescence, but it doesn&#039;t effect the taste. Looks a little like Fresca but tickles the nose. You can substitute lemon instead, but limes are less expensive around here. Just thought since you like food projects you might like this one. I&#039;m going to have to try the Pimm&#039;s with my next batch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i wasn&#039;t going to leave a comment even tho i&#039;ve had pimm&#039;s cup on my mind for months.  it seems to keep popping up in magazines or books i&#039;m reading and then you have to go and write a whole article about it!  i was just at a restaurant that had pimm&#039;s cup on the bar list - so exciting! - but of course they&#039;d just run out of pimm&#039;s no. 1 the night before. :( &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but then tonight i decided to go back thru my old bon appetits and found, in the feb 2006 issue, a little blurb right at the beginning (pg 20) describing the pimm&#039;s rangoon: pimm&#039;s no. 1, ginger beer, cucumber slices, an orange wheel, a strawberry &amp; a lime wedge.  hmmm.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(still haven&#039;t had a pimm&#039;s btw)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just stumbled upon your blog today and Pimm&#039;s caught my eye. It always does as it is close to my heart. My great-great grandfather invented it way back when. And this is not just bragging rights and by no means indicates that I am set for life as my family sold it all way back when,but when I see the love for the best summer drink ever (no bias here :)) it makes me smile and I enjoy that people around the world are enjoying it.&lt;br /&gt;Keep on enjoying, regardless if you use ginger beer, ale, lemonade...the key is the strawberry and cucumber in my opinion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a UK girl, I have tried many variations on Pimms; my favourite is a version we call Classic Pimms, which involves 1 x bottle of Pimms, 1/2 bottle Cointreau, 1/3 bottle brandy, 1 x bottle of lemonade and 2 x bottle tonic, split evenly into pitchers, muddled with mountains of mint and topped with wafer thin cucumber slices - absolute heaven for a big party punch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a soft spot for the Pimms ads, as in: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_Vw3lNqWvw]]></description>
