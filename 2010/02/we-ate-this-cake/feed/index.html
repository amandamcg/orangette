					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve made this twice in the last couple of weeks. I absolutely love it. My young adult boys won&#039;t even try it, so more for me. The last time I used Cara oranges which have a distinctly different color and taste than the typical naval oranges available to me. Too bad they are going out of season now in April. This cake is perfect for any time of day. Thank you for sharing it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made this cake for the first time in my new Kuhn Rikon Push Pan and I am happy to say the cake was a total success, one of the nicest cakes I have eaten in a long time.  So moist, so flavorful. I have always been afraid of using whole citrus because I hate bitterness, but this was perfect. Thank you so much for the recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a friend that makes this cake all the time, loved by all, tried &amp; true.&lt;br /&gt;But I was curious if it&#039;s ever been done into a bunt mold?&lt;br /&gt;Wonder if it would need to be changed to make it work. ???&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>
