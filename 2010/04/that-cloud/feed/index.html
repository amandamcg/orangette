					<description><![CDATA[Molly - tons of comments i see - so who knows if you will read this - i met you in LA last month at skyline books and I just finished the chapters in your book about your father and the way you described him and his last days - really wonderful and so I think of how beautifully you went through that and pray it would be the same for you with your grandmother during this time.  I love her coldcuts in the cloud comment - how perfect!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry about the loss of your grandmother. I lost mine 7 years ago and I still miss her dearly, but I have so many wonderful memories and treasures. She&#039;s still in my heart and sometimes I think she&#039;s hovering overhead watching closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;ve never commented here before. I just bought your book yesterday and I am so super excited. It looks yummy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted on April 16th, that my grandmother was also gravely ill. Alas, she succumbed in her sleep on April 26th. She was 99 years old, and hoping to reach her 100&lt;br /&gt;by celebrating with a huge party this coming fall. I was fortunate to live nearby and visited as often as I could. At the end, we all prayed she would go soon, so she would not have to suffer so much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope everything goes well for your grandmother, and if not, I sincerely hope she does not suffer. Blessing to you and yours in this difficult time.]]></description>
