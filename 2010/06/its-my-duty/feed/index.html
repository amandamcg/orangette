					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://orangette.net/2010/06/its-my-duty/#comment-22982&quot;&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;.

6.5 years after your post, Ms. Anonymous, I must respond! Reading your note, I was getting very excited, remembering the most divine and memorable ice cream EVER, sage with raspberry swirl exactly as you described. And voila! It was at that exact gelateria in Rome where I had it last Christmas and I haven&#039;t stopped thinking about it since. THANK YOU for your recipe rendition -- I decided on the spot to make it for this 2016 Christmas. Giddy!!!
Oh, and PS. Try bay laurel ice cream next; also exquisite with blackberries.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this for my dietician friends, and they loved it. I love anything fennel, and eat the seeds all by themselves. But you are right, that the flavor is so intriguing when steeped in cream and sugar! YUM!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was completely delicious - thank you. I also made it with coriander seeds (three times the quantity as they&#039;re not as strong as the fennel) which was pretty good too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Inspired by this post, my mother and I made fennel ice cream this past weekend to beat the East- Coast heat wave, which saddled even Maine (where she and my father live) with a terrible dome of misery. We bought strawberries from a roadside stand and dressed our bowls up simply, as you&#039;d suggested. I can&#039;t imagine a better antidote to what could ever possibly ail me, including 100+ heat indexes. I had it for dessert and also for breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!]]></description>
