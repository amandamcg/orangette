					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Molly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picked up your book last weekend and finally got to start it Thursday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your description of the Maine bed-and-breakfast stopped me cold; I had to call my spouse and read him the paragraphs. Seeing one of my fondest memories in print, without having written it, was startling and thrilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For several years, a trip to Jerry and Tony&#039;s inn was the highlight of our winter. &#039;Our&#039; room (the top floor with the outside entrance) was above the kitchen. We&#039;d wake each morning to the most amazing aromas wafting through the eaves, and play guessing games about what  awaited us in the sunroom. No matter the day&#039;s plans, we never missed tea and the blissful torment of choosing a dessert from the half-dozen options. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry and Tony&#039;s food changed something in both of us. My vegetable-hating husband tried (and grudgingly admitted liking) roasted Brussels sprouts. The two kinds of pate served at tea were a revelation, and every scone I&#039;ve had since then has disappointed. At their table, we experienced flavors, textures and scents  unimaginable before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for rekindling those memories, and for a book filled with humor, insight and deliciousness.]]></description>

<p>Picked up your book last weekend and finally got to start it Thursday. </p>
<p>Your description of the Maine bed-and-breakfast stopped me cold; I had to call my spouse and read him the paragraphs. Seeing one of my fondest memories in print, without having written it, was startling and thrilling.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I just finished your book. I was moved by your relationship with your parents. I think your father as you described him would be so proud of you and Brandon.&lt;br /&gt;I will be using a number of your recipes. I laughed at your obsession with cake- I too would be obsessed if it didn&#039;t seem to land on my hips and thighs. Thank you for a throughly enjoyable read and taste.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly,&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;ve been wanting to read your book for quite a while and picked it up on Saturday - I finished it on Sunday!  Obviously I really enjoyed it and wanted to say thanks.  Your stories about your family, particularly your Dad are very touching.  I am planning on making the tomato soup for lunch today and will be trying out many of the others too.  Thanks for the cooking inspiration.  Michelle]]></description>
