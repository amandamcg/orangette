					<description><![CDATA[Hi - I just wanted to share - So many people think that rhubarb is a Spring time, once a year delight.  I don&#039;t stop harvesting mine until late October into November.  DO NOT CUT RHUBARB STALKS.  Pull them.  Yep - just pull them.  If you do that, you will have rhubarb into the Fall.  When you cut the stalk, new stalks cannot grow.  If you pull the stalk out(gentle tugging, it will let you know if it&#039;s ready to be picked)a new stalk will form in that spot.  Try it  and you&#039;ll have &#039;barb all summer long.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you use 1/2 cup sugar (or any amount of sugar in anything) you may have ffewer than 50 Springs left. Yes, rhubarb is tart and needs sweetening, but white sugar (or brown sugar) are off limits for this 70 y/o who would be happy to have 20 Springs left. While honey isn&#039;t ideal, either, as it also contains too much sucrose, I do sweeten my rhubarb with it.  I use the honey sparingly and have learned to love the tartness of rhubarb.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this recipe :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After our three hens got free and planted their great big feet in the middle of my rhubarb crown and snapping all of the stalks, I had to cut it and do something quickly.  I have never liked it cooked in a pan as it just goes mushy even if you are careful so I roasted it with white wine, vanilla pod and only a bit of sugar as I love it kept tart - there is only me who likes it in the house so I get it all to myself!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow I am going &lt;br /&gt;to make a rhubarb cake and have some with vanilla ice cream.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made a recipe of roasted rhubarb that used sugar, vanilla bean and Creme de Cassis (from the San Francisco Ferry Plaza Farmers&#039; Market Cookbook). It was delicious. I agree with you about wine or liqueur and vanilla bean being wonderful with rhubarb.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[thanks for getting this recipie to me! I made it last night and it was sooo good! And I&#039;m pleased to say it still tastes good with less &#039;fancy&#039; ingredients :) I subbed in a tsp of vanilla extract b/c I don&#039;t have any beans, and I used a 1/2 cup of box white zinfandel I brought home from my parents b/c I didn&#039;t have wine either. And it was still delicious!! Thank you! I will definitely make it again.]]></description>
