					<description><![CDATA[I was skeptical about this recipe due to the whole wheat factor and lack of much butter/cream. I combined your sister&#039;s version and added candied ginger along with the apricots. They turned out to be quite good. I love the nutty aspect imparted from the whole wheat flour and they are healthy enough to enjoy routinely for breakfast. Well done!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[just made these yet again!  and will be shipping a box of them (a batch made with dried apricots and crystallized ginger, and a batch made with white chocolate and the trader joe&#039;s orange-flavored dried cranberries) to my sister, who just had a baby.  thanks to the whole wheat pastry flour, they&#039;re the perfect wholesome-seeming morning treat for a new mom and dad.  and thanks to you for posting them-- i&#039;ve never baked much before, but these scones have given me quite the reputation for breakfast awesomeness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Our family is reading your book, A Homemade Life.  Last night my husband and I returned from a weekend in San Francisco (ran the Bay to Breakers run).  We walked into the house and the kids (girl 16, boy 17) had made us Sunday evening dinner: Brandon&#039;s red cabbage salad, roasted chicken, corn/raspberry/argula salad, baguette, wine, candles, and a clean kitchen!!!  Love these kids.  Thanks for your inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vicki and Chris - San Diego]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;ve recently finished reading through Orangette&#039;s archives, and I also just made these scones this morning, to go along with some strawberry jam (also from your recipe) as a belated Mother&#039;s Day present. I linked to both recipes from my own blog, but then I felt a little creepy writing about you without even introducing myself. So, hello, and thanks for all the kitchen inspiration! I look forward to reading more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the scones were great, tender and not too sweet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this delicious recipe. I&#039;ve just tried it and it is every bit as good as you promised. However, in the absence of apricots I used dried cranberry (tastes good and is healthy!), and used a mix of whole wheat flour and white pastry flour (I didn&#039;t have whole wheat pastry flour). It is light, tasty, moist... just the perfect scone. &lt;br /&gt;Bon appétit to all!]]></description>
