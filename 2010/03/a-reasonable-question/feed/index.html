					<description><![CDATA[I just found this post via your most recent post (about Judy Rodgers&#039; roasted applesauce), and I am so excited to try it. I&#039;ve had delicious polenta (in restaurants) and always wondered about how it was made. I&#039;m from the land of grits, and wondered how similar it was to that preparation. I&#039;ve seen the tubes, as you mentioned, but those never seemed very appetizing to me. I can&#039;t wait to give this a try! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I thought only annoying parents refer to things in &quot;months&quot; once they get past 12 - but I find myself saying that 17 months after your original post, I followed your proprietary polenta preparation and it came off without a hitch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tripled the recipe (I&#039;m private-chefing for a bunch of yogis at Good Commons in Vermont) and the proportions were great, using a combination of homemade veg stock and water and finishing with some almond milk at the end. A hefty dash of salt, pepper, nutmeg and fresh thyme was added. To transcend from hospital food to vegan nirvana, I topped it off with wild mushroom friccassee. Yum.]]></description>
