					<description><![CDATA[Leeks are lovely &amp; this was good, once I found small leeks.  Everyone at the farmers&#039; markets here seems to think that bigger is better (just like they think white corn is preferable to yellow) -- I finally found one bunch of 6 that included 3 about the diameter of a quarter, but it was a search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little leeks did indeed become sweet after 10 minutes in boiling salted water, &amp; were very nice with the vinaigrette &amp; hardboiled egg garnish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of a poached egg too, maybe like eggs benedict, on a bed of leeks atop an English muffin with the vinaigrette poured over &amp; lots of coarse black pepper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#039;t have shallots, so made the vinaigrette with a green onion.  There&#039;s a little left over &amp; I&#039;m going to use it on steamed whitefish with brown rice (wish I had some leftover leeks to go with that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for another nice, useful recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was an au pair in France years ago, and the woman who employed me gave me only the food her kids wouldn&#039;t eat. Some of it was pretty good, but some was burnt or stale -- she was still living through WWII and had a desperate need not to waste anything. Your blog brought back some interesting memories. But the recipe was wonderful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore sharp flavours and could probably drink a really good vinaigrette straight from the container, some days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#039;t bake (used to but somehow lost the will), and although I love the stories in your blog and your book, it&#039;s the savoury recipes I try. Thanks for this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a sweet story behind the recipe! It&#039;s funny but I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for something to cook for my 22nd birthday dinner next week, and they sound perfect. Happy (belated) birthday, and I look forward to trying the recipe. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the first recipe of your blog that I didn&#039;t like! I think where it went wrong was the wrong sized leeks, maybe.  They were huge: 3 leeks were 2.5 pounds.  The texture in the end was...not desirable. Just a miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: don&#039;t use Incredible Hulk-sized leeks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I too was introduced to leeks by a French host mom, but only in leek and potato soup.  Don&#039;t know why they aren&#039;t more popular here.  I&#039;ve never had the leeks vinaigrette so I made them with our CSA leeks this week.  They are fabulous! I could have eaten the whole bowl myself.]]></description>
