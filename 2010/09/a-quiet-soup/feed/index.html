					<description><![CDATA[Just recovering from a cold so this soup came at the right time. Turned out really nice and the lemon gave it an interesting twist.&lt;br /&gt;What surprised me was that the recipe asked for adding the salt at the beginning. I was taught that you should never add salt to lentils until they were done as it alters with their cooking time. Anyway I did what the recipe told me to and it worked out fine. I am amazed...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this last night and used about 2 1/4 cups of lentils and omitted the extra two cups of water... the soup had the best, thick consistency and much more flavor!  So delicious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bookmarked some time ago, I finally made this, adding turmeric and a combination of ground arbel chilies, paprika and cayenne. Baby kale vs. minced cilantro. Nice, but I recommend omitting 2 cups of liquid. 8 cups of stock/water to 2 cups of lentils is just fine. The results were a bit too brothy for me, so I boiled the soup down as much as I could in the time that I had. Very good with skillet cornbread, grits vs. cornmeal, soaked in buttermilk while putting together the soup.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just made the soup. It is really delicious! Flavorful as promised but not kick-your-face spiced like a lot of lentil soups. I omitted the cilantro because my husband is not a fan, but I enjoyed the brightness from the lemon and tomato paste so I didn&#039;t really miss it. We ate this with crusty buttered French bread. My 2 year old picked up his bowl and slurped away. This is going in my recipe stack. Mmm mmm. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again and again for posting this recipe last year. I made it shortly after you posted it, and again last night. It&#039;s sure to be a yearly autumn favorite in our home. Cozy, with just the right amount of spice and warmth--it&#039;s a great find!]]></description>
