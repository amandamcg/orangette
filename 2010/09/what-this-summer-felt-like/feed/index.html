					<description><![CDATA[I love your blog, you are so artistic in your writing, you have a way of putting words together that is truely unique and captures the readers attention.  I have to admit I love the change, as the leaves change colour and the air is crisper, I just love the changing seasons they are like a constant and each is beautiful in their own way.  They are each so beautiful and unique and each have mysteries to unfold to you as you experience each of them again and again, learning to open to the world around you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love a good ferry ride and partake often.  You&#039;ve reminded me that I&#039;ve let the melons pass me by.  Every time I&#039;ve seen a beauty it seems I&#039;ve been on foot and not interested in strolling with the weight of a melon.  I wonder if I can still find a good melon or two or if I&#039;ve missed out.  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now autumn.]]></description>
