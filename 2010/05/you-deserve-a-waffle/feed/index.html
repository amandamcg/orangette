					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for doing this test. Though it was years ago! I tried and failed with the yeast waffles, due to a horrible cheap waffle iron I promptly returned. I greatly succeeded with the WIG waffles, taking your criticisms of that recipe into consideration I opted to try half whole wheat flour as I thought this might add depth of flavor. Perhaps I will feel differently after successfully making the yeast waffles, but the WIG&#039;s with my flour adjustment were delightful! My only complaint is there weren&#039;t very many, my 5 year old ate most of them and I had to scour for a recipe that didn&#039;t need buttermilk... I wasn&#039;t nearly as pleased with my second choice and it was much more laborious. Next time, I&#039;ll be sure to double the WIG recipe. Thanks again!]]></description>

Matt,

The day before I mixed the wet ingredients and refrigerated it overnight. The next morning added all the dry ingredients and let it sit out for about an hour. Just an easy way to save some time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Two questions:

1) for either recipe, can I simply add fruit to the recipe? I love banana or blueberry waffles, but would I need to adjust any other aspects of the recipe, even if I added the fruit immediately before cooking? (and don&#039;t dare tell me to put it on top - that&#039;s heresy)

2) how long will the non-yeast batter last in the fridge. I saw you mention in comments that the yeast batter will last a few days, but what about the other one? Just curious.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know this is an older post and not sure if you read comments on older posts, but I made the morning of waffles last weekend and we just loved them.  The best I have had.  I am curious though...it calls for quite a bit of oil.  They are very crispy and light.  I am wondering if you ever reduced the oil to try to make them a little lower in fat (we are inhaling them!).  I am going to try to make a triple batch this weekend as they freeze and reheat perfectly, but do not want to mess with perfection.  What do you think about reducing the oil and if so, how much?  Thanks so much Molly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had the loveliest, transcendent waffle experience this morning! Had every intention of making the WIGs (ha) but I forgot the milk on the stove and it overheated and the yeast was killed.. bummer. But the buttermilk batter was an excellent substitute! Having both recipes for planning/ not planning was key, thank you for such thorough testing! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Following up on my previous comment...&lt;br /&gt;I made the yeasted waffles and wow! they do have flavor! We loved them, my 13 month son could not get enough.&lt;br /&gt;I have a cheap, square waffle maker and they came out flat on one side, I think that maybe if I had one of those waffle irons that you turn as soon as you pour the batter, they would&#039;ve come out better. They do taste savory, so I added roasted chiles and cheddar cheese to half the batch and they were dreamy! &lt;br /&gt;Next week I&#039;ll add corns starch to MS recipe and see how that works. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love your blog and when I googled a recipe for yeasted waffles and your blog came up, I knew I had to try them! Unfortunately we wanted them right away, so I settle for the WIG recipe, which I have to say was disappointing :-( Up until now I&#039;ve been using a Martha Stewart recipe where you have to beat the egg whites separate and is a bit of work, but the results are much more to my liking then the WIG. We found the waffles to be bland in taste, but we did love the crunchy exterior, which reminded even when the waffles cooled (not the case with my recipe). I&#039;m still making the yeast version next week, I&#039;ll let you know how those turn out. Meanwhile, I might be able to improve on Martha&#039;s recipe by adding corn starch to the batter...]]></description>
