					<description><![CDATA[I just found this recipe after trying to find a recipe that might appeal to my  teenager to eat breakfast before school, because she won&#039;t eat anything. It&#039;s her last year of school, she needs brain food for the forthcoming exams. Sorted! she loves them. Only problem is there nae enough sugar and cinnamon for 6 slices of bread but then maybe loaves in Scotland are much bigger than the American counterparts! For a good wee warburtons loaf, increase by half again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Made these this morning, they didnt last the day!  Kids loved them as did I.  I even accidentally had the oven temp too high at 350 and overcooked them a tad.  They were awesome.  Making more for Christmas. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thought you might like to know that I just found and read and enjoyed this blog post after doing a google search on uses for stale bread.  This blog post was linked in someone else&#039;s blog listing 18 things to do with stale bread (or something like that)... This stood out by far as the best choice. :)  I&#039;ve got cinnamon toasts toasting in the oven as I write.  And I really enjoyed your post honoring your grandma and the snipits from the past.  I just thought I&#039;d post as I&#039;m always wondering how stangers happen upon my blog.  I know nothing else about you or your blog but I&#039;m super excited to try the cinnamon toasts, so thanks for sharing!]]></description>
