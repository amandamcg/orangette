					<description><![CDATA[Seconding the Hazelnut Waffles that someone posted from the King Arthur Flour Whole Grain Baking, if you want something a little more interesting :)   From the same cookbook, we also love their Chocolate-Chocolate Chip waffles (who wouldn&#039;t?), Peanut Butter-Chocolate Chip waffles (ditto), and Whole Wheat Sourdough Waffles.  For traditional, I love the Buttermilk Waffles from the America&#039;s Test Kitchen Family Cookbook - basic but good!

Oh, and it&#039;s also sometimes all about the toppings!  The KAF book has some great ones for waffles, from banana cream to pear compote to orange butter.  I love the Butter Pecan syrup and Maple Butter from Cook&#039;s Country, and am looking forward to trying their recipe for Apple-Cinnamon syrup next time I buy some apple jelly.

Happy breakfasting :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Years ago when I was in Mexico, one restaurant served their pancakes with mashed banana and  walnuts in the batter. They were to die for. Since then I have incorporated those same ingredients into my standard waffle recipe, but also adding grated or cubed apple, cinnamon and vanilla. They are  delicious and always a hit with guests!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have one word to say about waffles -- BACON.  My mother always put two slices of raw bacon across the waffle grill (that&#039;s 1/2 pieces of bacon per waffle) and the flavor of the bacon cooking crisp into the waffle will drive you crazy.  Stop by my site for more of our family favorites --  sherry    www.rosemaryandthegoat.com]]></description>
