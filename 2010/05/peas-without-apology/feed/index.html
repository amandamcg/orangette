					<description><![CDATA[I just looked in at your blog to look up a recipe, and I&#039;m flooded with childhood memories!  First, it was the breadcrumb soup and now the peas--the canned peas!  Dad&#039;s favorite comfort food.  When Mom would be working late or gallivanting (she was rather modern woman in the 50&#039;s) , she could always rely on Dad fixin&#039; his bacon and peas along with a big sandwich thrown in for good measure.  Talk about olive green peas--he loved those canned peas.  Just fry up some bacon and pour in the can.  How simple...and he was in hog heaven.  My sister and I would roll our eyes, but I think the last laugh was with him.  Now, he&#039;d probably wink at us as if to say &quot;I told you so.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been wanting to make this ever since you posted it, but my husband doesn&#039;t like peas and I&#039;m usually pretty lazy when it comes to cooking just for myself. It was worth the wait - delicious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love frozen peas.  Part of me feels like I &#039;should&#039; hate to admit it; but I do not.  I adore frozen peas (of course, nothing compares to fresh - popped straight into the mouth).  There is nothing more satisfying than having no fresh vegetables in the house, and finding that notorious bag of frozen peas in the freezer.  Ahhhh, pea salvation.  &lt;br /&gt;I do not know where I came up with it (who knows, it might be a tired n&#039; true recipe) but I adore peas in polenta.  When the polenta is almost done, add &#039;x&#039; amount of cooked frozen peas.  The combination - heavenly........]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ps: I think it&#039;s the garlic that brings out that fabulous extra, and the prosseciuto of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we like it this way as well - learned to make it this way from a sweet gay couple in France, who had a Chambre d&#039;Hôte: take some unsalted butter, and 2 - 3 scallions, chopped finely, let them sizzle, add peas (even canned ones are good, without the water in the can), a bit of water, salt &amp; black pepper to taste, crushed bay-leaves and thyme.]]></description>
