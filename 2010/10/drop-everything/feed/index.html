					<description><![CDATA[I just returned from Barcelona and this is the way the restaurants make and serve gazpacho -- it is delicious.  It is also similar to the gazpacho recipe in the Food of Spain by Claudia Roden.  But he leaves out the cucumbers and uses them as a garnish and also adds a big slice of toasted white bread in the blender -- it adds to the creaminess.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s so strange about the meatballs, Dayna!  Mine usually get nicely browned on the outside, but I&#039;ve never had them burn.  I don&#039;t know that the olive oil is the problem; I&#039;m wondering if your stove is too hot?  If they&#039;re burning before they cook through, that would be my guess.  You may also need to use a little more oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But!  If you&#039;d rather, you can bake the meatballs in the oven, and that&#039;s even easier.  Set the oven to 400 or so, and they should take about 15 minutes.  (Give or take; I can&#039;t remember exactly.)  You can put them on either a rimmed sheet pan or in the wells of a mini muffin tin.  The latter is what Alton Brown recommends.  I can&#039;t remember why, but he seemed to find that it produced a better meatball than cooking them on a sheet pan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the meatloaf alternative, I&#039;ve never tried it, but it&#039;s certainly worth a go.  I can&#039;t think of a reason why it wouldn&#039;t work...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I ADORE your Doron&#039;s Meatballs recipe, except every time I make them, by the time they are cooked on the inside, they are burnt on the outside.  I would love to serve them to guests, but not unless they are flawless.  Should I switch to cooking them in Grapeseed oil, instead of olive oil?  Can you recommend a sauce I could simmer them in, so they would cook, but not get too brown?  On days when I am pressed for time but crave this meal, could I use the same recipe and cook in a meatloaf pan for about 1 hour at 350 degrees?  Cooking them like a meatloaf would be a fantastic alternative.  Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really just wanted to comment and say that Settlers of Catan rocks my socks off and I&#039;m pleased whenever I meet someone or groups of someones who also plays! My fiancÃ©&#039;s fraternity introduced it to me (boardgames are kinda a big deal to them) and I&#039;ve been hooked ever since. We also love Dominion. The only sad thing is that since we both moved to the Northwest from the Midwest we&#039;ve yet to get any of our new acquiescences hooked on our favorite games yet. Also I plan on trying out Bananagrams soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am late to this thread, but let me warn you about the addiction of board games. My husband started small, a &quot;friend&quot; asked him to come over and play a game--now, we have (I kid you not) more than 800 board games in our game room! In a couple of weeks, he will fly to Texas to the Board Game Geek convention to play for 4 days straight. Next year, there will be a trip to the Mecca of board games--Essen Germany. There is a growing yet still underground group of board gamers out there. Besides the games, they love good food and great wine. I am usually the cook when the BGGers come over for Games Day. They drink CA reds, play games and I get to feed them. We are all happy. The Plum Tart was the star of a recent Games Day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay Molly, here&#039;s how to win at Bananagrams: Think of how you first learned to read; &quot;hat&quot; is inside &quot;that&quot; or change the H to make &#039;cat.&quot; That&#039;s how to think in Bananagrams. The other trick is to keep track of the &#039;easy add-on&#039; letters -- an &quot;A&quot; you put next to a &quot;N&quot; just to keep moving will be handy when an odd letter comes up and you need a vowel.  I squirrel these away as I play -- I&#039;m not going for impressing anyone with my cleverness.  That way I don&#039;t get stuck when the going gets fast. I know where my &quot;nuts&quot; are buried.  Does that help?  Now what&#039;s Catan? Have to check that out!]]></description>
