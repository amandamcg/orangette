					<description><![CDATA[I love reading through your older posts Molly. I grew up with oysters and have a somewhat different perspective (I LOVE them) but your descriptions, as always is so entertaining. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and that picture you took of the back of the brunette girl at the bar. Beautiful Did you take it with the Pentax K 1000? You know, you inspired me to purchase one. It&#039;s in the mail as I type :) Even if you took it with a different camera, it&#039;s still a stunning picture. I feel like I&#039;m there, at the other end of the bar.&lt;br /&gt;Bella @ seaandsalt.com&lt;br /&gt;xx]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(Long time reader, first time commenter.

					<description><![CDATA[First, you must read this comment with the knowledge that I am 8 weeks pregnant and on the verge of hormonal insanity.  &lt;br /&gt;Second, I wanted to say that I have not read your blog, or any blog in about 2 months (tired and sick and food writing, especially, didn&#039;t sit well) and I am just catching up today.&lt;br /&gt;This post made me cry.&lt;br /&gt;Your writing, your photographs, the way you capture so much beauty and feeling as you tell me about oysters--it moved me.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was the man from Texas and his son.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to be back.&lt;br /&gt;And I thought you should know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still terrified of oysters though.

					<description><![CDATA[I love your recipes, I love your stories and rich connections between food and family, and I *really* love your beautiful writing.  This paragraph is one of my favorites ever (this is Bronwen -- I sent you my &quot;pink Cookie&quot; poems once):  &quot;I made everyone look away, and then I ate it. Only one, and it was tiny, but I ate it. I chewed and everything. I didn‚Äôt die. And when I swallowed, the flavor rang around my mouth the way the ringing of a bell ricochets inside a cathedral, now here, now there, and it did that for maybe ten seconds, now here, now there, before it dissipated. It tasted like seawater and melon and wet rocks. I didn‚Äôt even hate it. I almost liked it.&quot; thanks*]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[okay, so i am 4 years old and my mother takes me to red lobster (blech) and orders oysters - she puts one that looks to me like something someone just hacked up on a saltine cracker and orders me to eat it - while i am disgustedly chewing, she says &quot;you know, it&#039;s still alive&quot; - i sprayed oyster all over the table, all over the booth, and all over her - i am 37 and i haven&#039;t had one since!]]></description>
