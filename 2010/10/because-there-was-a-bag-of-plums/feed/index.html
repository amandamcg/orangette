					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t posted before but when I recognized that I was pulling up this page to make this plum tart for about the tenth time I thought it was time to write. Thank you for your blog - I use it all of the time; it&#039;s by far my favorite food blog that exists. I love your book, your podcast, your recipes, and your photographs. You deserve the credit for the rave reviews I get about the delicious things I make using your recipes! Cheers, and thanks again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Angela, I do think this tart would freeze nicely.  You might lose some of the crispy texture around the edges - winding up, then, with a more uniformly cakey / chewy result - but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s a big deal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gosh, I&#039;m sorry I&#039;m so late reading and posting. This looks and sounds scrumptious. But I have a question. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could you make this with a jam or jelly? It looks so beautiful. And the solution to waiting til Summer is to use what&#039;s preserved for winter. But I have no idea how that would effect cooking heat or time. Or even if it&#039;s wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#039;s not too late to reply to posts on this one, do you have any ideas on this?]]></description>
