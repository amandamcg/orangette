					<description><![CDATA[Molly ,  I don&#039;t know if my words will make it to you but I&#039;m secretly hoping that you come across my message . Oh lord!  
I realised very recently that for the past 7 months I&#039;ve been coming back to this post every once in a while.  Every time I feel down . Every time my skin feels so tight and my heart so heavy.  
My breakup back in January crushed my soul . I felt ( and still do )  ashamed,  guilty, broken, empty and incredibly sad . Not myself.  Every single day , my main occupation was to find comfort somewhere.  I cooked at odd hours.  I was awake when everybody else was sleeping.  I ugly cried at the grocery store,  at the bakery, down the road,   on the phone, and every unimaginable place you could think of.  To this da I  still struggle with the idea of a new love . I can&#039;t see beyond my lost love.  Your words bring me peace and healing.  Knowing that somewhere in this world,  someone brave got to deal with her own loss and still managed to believe in a new beginning comforts me in a way that I&#039;ve never thought possible .  Your story made me believe that pain can&#039;t go on eternally. It made me believe that one day I will wake up not hurting anymore and not feeling sorry for myself . If anything,  what I&#039;ve been going  through for the past several months is a visceral reminder that I have truly loved.  I am forever grateful and humbled]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, 
I donâ€™t know if you check comments here anymore but Iâ€™d like to think you do. Iâ€™ve been listening to Spilled Milk for years but have never thought to venture here. I think of you as an old friend that has come with me on road trips, sat with me on my way to work, watched my life grow and change. Iâ€™ve been curious about your split with Brandon and Iâ€™m so glad to read this. I am so happy that youâ€™re happy and able to find joy in life. I am so glad that youâ€™ve found Ash and that your family is totally whole and not broken. More than this, I am encouraged and in aw of your writing and transparency. I hope that should my life ever shift, I will be as honest and open about it as you have been with yours. Thank you for being you and for being brave! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f495.png" alt="ðŸ’•" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I get to visit your site less frequently now that I have a toddler to chase after at home and am not sitting at a desk all day, but still come back to check in periodically. This post from over a year ago has stuck with me, being a fellow late blooming lesbian, coming out at 36. 
Just wanted you to know that you&#039;re missed and that strangers on the interwebs hope that your life, although sometimes complicated, is beautiful and delicious.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Coming here almost two years after you wrote it to thank you for this post and everything that&#039;s come after. More than 10 years into my relationship with my now husband, I&#039;ve just come out as bisexual, first to him a couple of months ago and more recently to other people in my life. In many ways, our stories are very different, but your openness has meant so much to me on my journey. Thank you for that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Incredible. 
I ate up your first book and a lot of the recipes in it. I lived down the street from Delancey,
and still do sometimes. 
Read your blog every day. Saw you speak at the UW. Love eating at Delancey. 
Good work all around Molly. I am impressed. 
This morning as I padded around my apartment in eugene, oregon, I thought of Orangette. Looks like itâ€™s been a really long time since I visited last. I wondered where the blog I was used to, went. I dug a little and found some of the latest news. What a surprise. I never wouldâ€™ve thought, and what a relief in a lot of ways, for some reasons. 
Thank you for all you do and for all you are. I love your writing, your stories, and your recipes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My wife is much more of a foodie than me and follows you. She told me about this post and how moving it is. I completely agree. What I find even more amazing are the comments from hundreds of people sharing support and similar stories. Wow. Molly, thank you for sharing your vulnerability with the world. And, to all the other readers who shared comments - your support, kindness, and realness is inspiring. Thank you. - from a new reader and a new fan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just coming across this now.  I was thinking of you because someone asked about food tours of Seattle.  I&#039;ve been out of touch with you for so long, but I remember well our visit in NYC, and my quick visit to Seattle with you and Brandon, shortly before your wedding during  a plane layover. All I can tell you is this -- nothing is more perfect, more beautiful, more rewarding than the truth.  You&#039;ve chosen to live a beautiful and rewarding life, and to be the person who deserves that life and will be at the center of that life.  I wish you all joy, now and every single day.]]></description>
