					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going through particularly hard times and I constantly find myself looking for comfort in the weirdest places,  soups and cooking blogs ! 1 am ! I&#039;m going to look for the best looking ham bone in town first thing in the morning right after my coffee. Cheers Molly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yum! Perfect soup for the polar vortex bearing down on Chicagoland this minute. Found a beautiful ham hock so my Han stock was heavenly, especially with an overnight chill for de-fatting. I agree with the idea of sweating the veggies (&quot;until they&#039;re the color of honey&quot;)with some smokey bacon (Nueske&#039;s) if the ham isn&#039;t smokey enough. Otherwise, I had to adjust cooking times to my reluctant peas, but we loved this and will have it again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love your comment about split-pea soup looking like toxic waste water! I also love split-pea soup regardless of how it looks. It is the one soup my husband will make and it&#039;s similar to yours except we put in some cayenne pepper... not a lot, but it gives it a kick we enjoy]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re cooking a ham on Sunday, so I&#039;ve got split pea soup in my near future! Mine definitely resembles your older recipe more than this one but I always use a bone for the lovely body it adds, especially to the leftovers. 
I also add a cheesecloth bundle of thyme and whole cloves, does anybody else do that? 
Laurien, the comment below yours has your answer - smoked turkey wings!]]></description>

I made this soup last night with smoked turkey wings and yellow split peas. It was great. Don&#039;t forget to add the potatoes! That was a revelation to me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am 37-years-old and have to say that I have despised peas my entire life (perhaps this was due to only having canned vegetables as a child). About a year ago, my boyfriend made dinner for me and served snow peas on the side. This was a new relationship, so I wanted to be nice. I ate them all...and LOVED them! Since then, I have been adding fresh peas to many of my recipes. I was still scared to attempt pea soup, but I tried this recipe last night and I am absolutely in love! Thank you so much for this recipe!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have made gallons upon gallons of yummy split pea soup throughout my cooking life but last year made the best split pea soup EVER using a stove top pressure cooker. When you want some good soup fast (less than 15 minutes) the pressure cooker is a good option. Thanks for sharing this recipe - I&#039;ll give it a try the next time I have a few hours to putter around the kitchen; sadly that isn&#039;t very often. Love your blog and your books!]]></description>
