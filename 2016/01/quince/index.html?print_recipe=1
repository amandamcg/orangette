    <p>In Seattle, I&#8217;ve found quince at the farmers&#8217; market in the wintertime, and I venture to guess that Whole Foods or another fancy-ish store might have it, too. I also hear that you can sometimes find it at Asian and Middle Eastern markets.</p>
<p>Oh, and everyone talks about how difficult and treacherous it is to peel a quince, but as long as I use my extremely <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCFTWU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001BCFTWU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=RT7TRPTVPFSZHRUC" target="_blank">cheap-and-trusty Y-peeler</a>, it&#8217;s no biggie. Muuuuch easier than using a knife.</p>

      <div class="recipe-list">
                                <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1/2 cup (120 ml) maple syrup, preferably Grade B          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            6 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            Pinch of kosher salt          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            2 cups (475 ml) water          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            2 medium quince (each about 9 ounces / 255 grams), peeled          </div>
                  </div>
  
      <div itemprop="instructions">
      <p>In a medium saucepan, combine the maple syrup, cardamom pods, salt, and water. Whisk to combine.</p>
<p>Cut one of the quince into 8 wedges. Place one wedge, flat side down, on a cutting board, and use a sharp knife to cut a V-shape in the center, removing the seeds. Repeat with the remaining wedges, placing the prepared wedges in the saucepan as you go. Repeat with the second quince. (You&#8217;ll probably note, by the way, that the flesh begins to brown when it&#8217;s exposed to air, the way the flesh of an apple does; don&#8217;t worry too much, because the discoloration will disappear as the quince cooks.)</p>
<p>Place the saucepan over medium-high heat, and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer, and cover the pan loosely with a lid, leaving a small crack for steam to escape. (Since the quince will take a while to cook, you want to keep as much moisture in the pan as possible, but you <em>do</em> want to let a small amount of the liquid evaporate, so that it slowly reduces a bit.) Cook gently until the quince is very tender when pierced with a knife, approximately the texture of a canned pear. This may take as little as 50 minutes or as long as 2 hours, depending on your fruit. (Seneviratne advises that you keep an eye on the pot and add more water if needed to keep the fruit submerged until it&#8217;s ready, though mine didn&#8217;t come anywhere near needing it.)</p>
<p>When the fruit is tender, remove it carefully from the pan to a bowl or storage container, leaving the liquid behind. Fish out the cardamom pods, and discard them. Raise the heat to medium-high and simmer the poaching liquid briskly, stirring frequently, until it has reduced to about one-third of its original volume and is thickened like syrup. Pour the syrup over the fruit, and allow to cool completely.</p>
<p>Serve the cooled quince in wedges or slice it thickly, and be sure to drizzle it with syrup.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: Stored in an airtight container, the cooked quince will keep for up to a week.</p>
