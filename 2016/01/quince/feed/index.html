That&#039;s so weird, Ann!  I just checked the Pinterest icon at the top of the post and the ones on each photo, and they all worked for me. I don&#039;t know what to tell you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live in Sofia, Bulgaria and the neighborhood we live in is filled with quinze trees.  They are absolutely beautiful in the springtime, with large, pale-pink blossoms.  There is one right outside my kitchen window.  Anyway, now that I know they are this lovely poached, I am very interested to try your recipe.  Thank you, Molly.]]></description>

Molly - Just wanted to say THANK YOU for the TJ&#039;s Euro-Style yogurt recommendation. I&#039;m devoted to it now! 
(I will still look for Straus, whenever I get to our singular, pain-in-the-butt-to-get-to Whole Foods, here in Charlotte).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mmmm.  The first time I had quince was in Italy.  It was fairly common on cheese plates.  Usually served as a jam.  Perfect with pecorino.  Looks like I&#039;ll be driving over to Salem this fall to get some fresh for myself.  Thank you for the recipe! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.malknives.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just read about your quince. A friend has a quince bush and made me jelly for Christmas. What a delightful surprise. 
I had heard of it, but not until the jelly had I tasted it. In the last month I have seen a paste and found it in a non-cooking book.]]></description>
