					<description><![CDATA[Molly &#038; companions, I feel utterly illiterate.  The only Hass I&#039;m acquainted with is this dark green completed character, who, like me, has a classic Bell bottom. 
       That aside, your students are fortunate indeed. Your post touched me, too. I am sorry for your grieving. I hope that memories of the good times will help assuage it. 
        I will be back.  
Most sincerely, 
Carol]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I reminisced about Moe and the times we had when reading your blog. I will be 88 this April, as Moe would have.  I was sorry to hear of your marital separation that you found necessary at this time.  Be assured that I wish you well in your heartfelt decision.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi. You had a post at some point in the past that included a reference to a song by a musician from Africa I think.  I listened to the song and loved it, then forgot about it.  Trying to find it on your blog and no luck. Can you help?

					<description><![CDATA[New subscriber here. I&#039;m sorry for the loss of your father.

I hate to intrude with a cooking question but is there anything I can substitute for  Muscavado? I&#039;ve looked online at the prices and they go from expensive (for me) to omigod you&#039;ve got to be joking. I love banana bread; in fact, I collect recipes for it, but that sugar is too high in price for me.]]></description>
