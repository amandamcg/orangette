Hi Martha!  Thank you so much for your kindness. I will be back!  This summer has just been a doozy, that&#039;s all, and I&#039;ve had to focus my attentions elsewhere. x]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Molly for years of great posts and recipes. You singularly helped me to become more serious about what I serve my  family. I  miss you regularly posting but understand that maybe you have grown beyond your blog. So good bye, I need to not look everyday and be disappointed that you are not here.  I wish you the best of luck in all your endeavors.  May God bless you and your family always. 

Sincerely,
Martha Grunwald]]></description>

Your daughter is lovely and your guitar and harmonica playing are plaintive and soulful. I just love that you are making music with your daughter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just did a cooking class in my little town of France that was not very fun at all. I am glad that there are many people in the world who like to cook, but I am most grateful for the many people who like to cook with an attitude that I find balanced--with a sentiment for the heart and the memory and the rest of the world around them and taste and living your life, all in addition to one&#039;s health. I dunno. I like your blog. I love Ethan Hawke. I like eating things that are fun. I like butter. Not all the time but geez Louise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ethan Hawke? I would leave my husband for Ethan Hawke. And &quot;Fade into You&quot;??? Doesn&#039;t it just make your breathing slow down and the world kind of stop and your insides sort of feel like you are 21 and heartsick in the best way? Thanks for all the smiles I had while reading this post, Molly!]]></description>
