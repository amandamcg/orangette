I don&#039;t know where in SoCal you are headed, but in San Diego, Sicilian Thing has a great square pie, and I&#039;ve heard good things about Jersey Joe&#039;s, although I was more of a thing slice (Pizzeria Luigi&#039;s or Bronx Pizza) myself.  I&#039;m new to Seattle and still trying to find all the right pizza spots.  This one looks like my childhood memories, and I&#039;m excited to give it a try.  Very smart to play the nostalgia angle so strongly-that&#039;ll almost ensure my taste buds are in a favorable mood!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We love Delancy but have fallen head over heals for the Dino&#039;s pie. We had been waiting for you guys to open (I was 9 months pregnant and craved pizza nearly every day) and once we had the chance to go try Dino&#039;s, we ate way to much of your rectangular pizza at the bar. I mean gorged ourselves... Within an hour after leaving my water broke all over the sidewalk by our house. I think it was the pizza that did the trick so we thank you guys for that! Now it&#039;s our Friday night date night, since baby isn&#039;t allowed in, Blake runs and gets a pizza to go and we enjoy it at home. The best part is having the leftovers that weekend with a broiled egg on top for breakfast. We soon will be moving back to So Cal and will miss your pizzas so very much!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Although my husband&#039;s family lives in Seattle, I haven&#039;t gone up often in the past several years. So imagine my surprise when on a recent weekend visit, just the two of us had the night to ourselves. Immediately I asked to go to Dino&#039;s Tomato Pie (that lure of Negronis on tap, and intensely considered pizza dough!) He loved it and so did I. Thank you all at Dino&#039;s and to you Miz Molly for a treasured evening before the storm...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went to Dino&#039;s this past weekend while in Seattle and even brought along a friend who was in town for work at the same time. We walked up from downtown and it was a beautiful evening. I love that Dino&#039;s already seems established in the neighborhood and isn&#039;t obviously new. The pizza was good and I had a Long Island. The space felt comfortable and if I was local I would surely come back. We joked that having a nose ring must be a requirement to work there and had nothing but good service. I had a moment of confusion in the bathroom while i tried to figure out how to turn the light on before realizing it was on (red bulb, black glitter, black toilet). It was like being in a photography dark room or on stage during a set change :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I live a stone&#039;s throw from Dino&#039;s, and for anyone who&#039;s coming out of town:  parking in this neighborhood is very tough.  Here&#039;s some great news:  there is now a gorgeous light rail train stop 4 blocks away.  It opened in March 2016, and is making Capitol Hill so much more accessible.  Search Seattle light rail link schedules to find out if this is a viable transportation mode for you.  If you&#039;re coming from the north, you can leave your car in the university district, walk through the beautiful university campus and take light rail to the Capitol Hill station.  If you&#039;re coming from the south, light rail stretches all the way to Sea-Tac airport.  Depending on where you exit, walk down the hill via John Street or Denny Way for 5 minutes.  Both take you directly to the Olive Way intersection - and there&#039;s Dino&#039;s.  Enjoy!]]></description>
