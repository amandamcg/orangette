					<description><![CDATA[My daughter said: You should make this when we have company. This dish is divine. Like a lemony alfredo, but lighter. We used rotini also - thought it was perfect - and stirred some freshly grated parmesan into the pasta before serving (and then topped with a little more parm and freshly ground pepper). Mmmm.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this recipe. Always looking for simple recipes that my picky daughter might actually like. She likes pasta, and lemon-flavored things, so hoping she digs this! Oh and did I mention she&#039;s 22? :) Never outgrew the picky stage. Looking forward to giving this recipe a try.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah the naked bender...we had one of those.  The highlight of which was after my hip replacement surgery when he was 18 months.  After a bath, he decided he was going to stay naked and ran around the house yelling &quot;ha-ha-ha, you can&#039;t catch me!&quot;  until he tripped over my crutches and fell on top of them cutting a giant hole out of his nose. Naked boy, blood everywhere, 911 called, paramedics asking me to turn down the music, my husband calling to say he was going to have to work late.  I answered, &quot;hang on, the paramedics are just leaving and T is peeing on the carpet.&quot;  He is 27 years old now, happily married to an amazing woman and they would love that lemon pasta recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love simple food. We have a meyer lemon tree in the back yard. The lemons are the size of a smallish grapefruit and we get about 3/4 cup of juice out of each one. I actually had to google how much lemon juice is &quot;the juice of one lemon&quot; because I knew it couldn&#039;t be as much as I was getting from my lemons. Two tablespoons. I was surprised.  &quot;nudity bender&quot; - best comment about naked toddlers ever (my youngest was a nudist for the longest time).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Coming back to say that I made this for dinner tonight.  I was unsure the first bite, loved it by the second bite.  Followed the recipe pretty closely, but did make a few changes-1 lb of regular (no egg) pasta, 1.25 cups of cream to make up for the extra pasta (but I think next time I might just add a little pasta water instead of extra cream), and I strained out the lemon zest before pouring the cream over the pasta.  And thank goodness you mentioned lemon sizing--mine must be very large, because one was plenty.  Thanks for the great recipe!]]></description>
