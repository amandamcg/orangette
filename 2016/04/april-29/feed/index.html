Erin, I wish I were! As far as I know, however, the festival in Sitka is bringing in a new crop of teachers for the 2017 season. I&#039;ll let you know if anything changes!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly! Are you doing the Sitka workshop again this year? I was so sad to miss it last year, so I am hoping the answer is YES and I can book my travel ASAP! 

Thanks!

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, as a devoted reader and listener - although sometimes you get those terms confused on the show :) - I&#039;m so excited to say that I registered for your workshop in Sitka! I&#039;ve been wanting to travel there for a while now, and this was the perfect reason to. Looking forward to the week greatly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was just checking out your events page. Have you ever thought of coming to Iowa City? It is a great place for writers, as it is home to the Iowa Writers&#039; Workshop, and it is also a haven for creative food folks (and you know...ME, returning this fall. It&#039;s relatively close to Ohio....! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Every now and then, I get a Sunday morning all to myself. When I do, I make myself breakfast and coffee, head out to the patio and bask in the early morning light, the quiet, and the joy of reading every blog post of yours  since the last time I had a Sunday morning  all to myself. And every time I get to, I think I should let you know how much I enjoy it...so today I am. That&#039;s all, and thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made Ed Fretwell Soup for the first time this morning, Molly. What is it about a good soup?  I swear, I can eat this (and I will) every day for weeks. The teens sons aren&#039;t so interested in it.  Yay for me and my lunches!]]></description>
