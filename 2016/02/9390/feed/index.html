					<description><![CDATA[I loved reading this. Honestly, I needed to read this. I have a almost three year old, who wants to be in every corner of the kitchen. And I have a cook (yes, I know. Yes, I live in that part of the world where people have cooks) who refuses to let him do anything in there. We aren&#039;t so fond of her cooking, and I am seriously thinking of taking matters in our own hands, and I am so looking forward to doing some of the things you suggest. Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a 3 yr old as well ( plus an 8 yr old, 20 yr old and 21 yr old... I&#039;m 47 and tired, lol )  Cooking /baking is so much fun with her because she gets so excited to look at all my cookbooks ...every page. (just like her mama <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f604.png" alt="üòÑ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) She is hilarious to chat with and man,  she tries so hard to control herself when stirring, pouring , adding ingredients etc. She is my wild one so I can really appreciate her efforts ! What she can&#039;t control whatsoever,  is sneaking tastes and often ends up consuming her weight in batter or frosting ....all 29 lbs of her <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f645.png" alt="üôÖ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  I pretend not to notice <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  On another note , I have my Montessori teaching  degree and taught in Seattle for years before I became a SAH mom. The owner/director of the school I taught at, Childrens World Montessori ,   has been a prominent fixture in the Montessori world for over 25+ years now and runs schools at several locations. I taught in Wedgewood next to AE- 2 as well as in the old Sandpoint Elementary school building . She has a school at U Village and another located in Westlake Center ...a few doors down from Palomino&#039;s , yummmmm <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f374.png" alt="üç¥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f35d.png" alt="üçù" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f378.png" alt="üç∏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Lunch time field trip anyone ?  The Practical Life skills were always my favorite lessons to present and teach and a favorite of my little students as well. Everyone wanted to rush to the PL area first thing every morning after circle . They couldn&#039;t get enough of being allowed to do certain tasks on their own, with REAL equipment and materials !! From folding napkins, sweeping, pouring water, peeling a carrot, poishing a shoe etc...small children love to help and ya gotta get em&#039; involved while they are still interested and willing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60b.png" alt="üòã" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It&#039;s not long before they barely give you the time of day and if they do, its usually with an extreme eye roll and an accompanying gutteral sound or snotty comment. Charming <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="üòõ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . Until then, I hope June is enjoying school and learning how to become great little sous chef ...or at least happy to help clean up. I&#039;m thinking we have a few good years left , lol  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/270c.png" alt="‚úå" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f604.png" alt="üòÑ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://orangette.net/2016/02/9390/#comment-45919&quot;&gt;Meaghan&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m glad to hear this - I too cooked a lot with my oldest when she was 1.5-2.5yo, but when baby #2 stopped napping so much it got much harder, and then as he got more interested in helping himself it just became a gong show with me trying to pay attention to too many things at once. We now have baby #3 and I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;m ever going to get to cook with them, since I&#039;ve learned that one-on-one is much much better for my sanity and for the kids too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really really REALLY love this post.  I often find that I stumble upon articles, blog posts, song lyrics, at times when I really need them.  I have a 3.5 year old at home who I have been wanting to get more involved in the kitchen.  We are a family of cooks who love to create, eat and share with loved ones.  I really want to instill that in him, I want him to know what a joy cooking can be and the great pleasure that comes from feeding people.  I also really want him to be able to feed himself more than top ramen when he gets older. However, I have been a bit weary as I am more than uptight about germs and cross contamination and cleanliness in the kitchen, but you are so right!  Messes can be cleaned up and germs can be killed, so its really about preparing for him in the kitchen and putting some thought into the things he can help make.  AND boy would he love to learn how to crack an egg.  I think this weekend, with my husband on standby to talk me off the ledge when egg inevitably lands on the floor, he will learn to crack an egg!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My just turned three year old helped mix up the Hearts and Minds cake last night for seder. Honestly, it&#039;s kinda perfect. I melted the chocolate and butter, she mixed in the sugar, and then beat the eggs in a cup to add to the batter and mixed happily away. So many eggs to mix! 

And considering I&#039;m pregnant with twins(!), the fact that she can find a snack in the fridge or pantry on her own is going to be very convenient soon. Hurrah for stools!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic list! I love baking with my little boy, and yes they can crack eggs much younger than I ever thought - he started when he turned one, and yes it was a mess but he loved it. Now he&#039;s 5, measuring things and using the scales are a great way to bring numbers, addition and so on into his normal day without it feeling like school. 

Gorgeous pictures, by the way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are absolutely right about not to cook with children when you are in a hurry or when you dont want your kitchen to be dirty..haha! It will only make us nuts. My daughter is 3. From this reading i get the inspiration to involve her in some means of kitchen activities within a few months. Wish me good luck!]]></description>
