					<description><![CDATA[My family knows me as a shrimp fiend, though I have yet to tackle the frightening prospect of cooking them. That recipe sounds delicious, though, and I&#039;ll add to the stack I have for brave times.

I did manage a palatable Pistachio and Apricot cake for my church singles group the other day; two of the ladies in attendance said it was good (high praise, since the other snacks I&#039;ve made are met with polite silence)! The third was gluten-free, so experiments beckon. The only complaint arose from my little sister who was less than thrilled at my hogging the oven for half the day. 

Lovely writing and delicious descriptions as usual. More, more, more, please.]]></description>

Then reading - you mentioned that Marian was with you - and she spends time in Sorrento:  did you get the hat from her?]]></description>
