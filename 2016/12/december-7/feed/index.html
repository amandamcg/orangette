					<description><![CDATA[Dear Molly,
Just thought to say hello again. I&#039;ve enjoyed reading your blogs and  looking at the picture of Moe poolside. Did l mention that Moe and I were April/&#039;29 guys? We had good times during our teens and I think of them quite often. I&#039;ve had to give up   hunting and fishing as of late because of health reasons but Naomi and I are quite active with our hobbies and travel ....specially to the &quot;kids&quot; and grandkids. 

I trust all is well with you and yours. Hugs,
Ted Webb]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,
Thank you so much for posting this lovely picture! It absolutely made my day. Dad and Burg both look so.... quintessentially themselves, I guess. Utterly secure in themselves and their world. A little drunk and a lot happy. Thank you again for reminding me of such happy times. :)

PS- My mom named our pool cleaner Sammy in an vain effort to make him seem more approachable, but even so, I always made sure to keep an extra eye on him whenever I was in the pool!

Oh and PS:  I use your recipe for those buckwheat sables so often that I know it by heart - just made my variation about an hour ago:  subbed walnuts for nibs and dipped half in bittersweet chocolate.  Ridiculously good : )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hee hee...your bravery makes me feel so happy.  I&#039;m hetero but still, it is just inspiring to have someone share so much of themselves in such a brave way, esp when you have such a following here and on the podcast.  I&#039;m also among those who&#039;ve read your blog from the beginning and have enjoyed seeing you grow and your voice expand in different ways and moods.  Thank you so much for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I miss you too, Molly. I hope you&#039;re well. I NEVER post on blogs (and only follow two), so this message is a big deal for me. Wishing you best wishes and hoping you find your way back to Orangette.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m thankful for this blog, and your books, and every delicious, poignant, delightful moment it has all brought me.  If you never post again, I am grateful for all that I have enjoyed reading and eating because of you.  Life sometimes requires that we go on cooking (and living) on our own steam!  (with your glorious inspiration, it is all more than we could EVER  have asked for......)
Bless you and all those that you love, may life&#039;s long and varied path bring you all the very best......

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,
I&#039;ve been a quiet part of this community for years. I really enjoy both your posts and the comments that follow- you have sculpted space for people who cherish food and family and beauty. I baked your adaptation of the busy day cake last week when I was having a particularly rough day in a week where I felt I was failing at everything- work, being a wife and mother, being genuinely present in my life. The cake fell a little (due to altitude) but it was sweet and nutty with a slightly crisp, caramelized edge. I ate two slices warm with tea, and went to bed satisfied. Thank you for sharing yourself here. I will continue to check in to see what comes next.]]></description>

I am not nearly as eloquent as David or you, Molly.  All I can do is echo his lovely writing and sentiment.  Where ever your journey is taking you, please accept my thanks and heartfelt well wishes along with my hope (and finger crossing) that we will be lucky enough to hear from you soon.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know you in real life, more to the point you don&#039;t know me. But I miss your voice, your insights, your charm. For a dozen years you were always there. So now, I think I need to send... Warm thoughts? Quiet support? A lifetime&#039;s adoration of the woman who taught me about the joys of canned beans? I came to your blog because of your deeply caring approach to food as a part of life, I kept with it because of your deeply caring approach to life. However it plays out, if Orangette is over, if Orangette changes into something new, I&#039;ll be here â€” or wherever you take me. But in any case, I want to say: Thank you, thank you, thank you. You have made my life better. I just wish I knew how to repay the debt.]]></description>
