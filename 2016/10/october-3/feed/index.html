					<description><![CDATA[Hi- this is my teenage daughter&#039;s fav dinner when her dad works late- cozy, yummy made with high protein noodles and an extra egg- cause we all need some protein too.  It makes me happy to cook her something she loves- and will be able to cook for herself when she heads off to college all too soon- looking forward to your new book- maybe you will revive your blog when it comes out- It is very clear that you have a lot to say and a lot of people who want to listen to you!

					<description><![CDATA[What a riot!  I guess everyone has some form of this restorative broth handed down to them.  When I was very little so very long ago, my Nona would make a similar concoction with College Inn chicken broth (when homemade was not available) breadcrumbs, eggs, and grated romano cheese mixed together to form a sort of noodle when pressed through a ricer into the soup and most certainly topped with more cheese.  I used to call it the &quot;breadcrumb soup.&quot;  It was so warm and comforting and would still be to this day.  Thank you for reminding me of that sweet memory and a forgotten recipe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made this today as I&#039;m working from home, it took 10 minutes and is maximum comfort! I will definitely be saving things for sick days, rainy days, lazy days (and everyday!). Thanks so much for this recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had bookmarked this recipe when you first posted it, but it took until today to make it. I&#039;m a SAHM, with the flu, and two preschoolers underfoot. This was a lunchtime savior. And it absolutely will be made again, likely becoming a back-pocket meal for our family, too. Thank you for posting:) 

(I&#039;m also a nearly decade-long blog reader. So many of your recipes have become staples for us. And it&#039;s taken me this long to comment on anything, if you&#039;re wondering how much of an impact this dead-simple soup had on my day)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After listening to Arthur Russell I instantly thought of this haunting song for me.
Tom Jones singing Elvis Presley Blues. I&#039;m left wondering who influenced who.
I hope you enjoy it.

Could you make a Pho or find a great recipe for one you love and post here?
With Chicken, of course. I&#039;m going broke eating it here at Saigon in Portland. ME. A city you ought to visit yourself if you&#039;re a foodie and writer.]]></description>
