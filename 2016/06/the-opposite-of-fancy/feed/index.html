					<description><![CDATA[Got to admit, I&#039;ve been hooked on the idea of this dip since you posted it but, alas, I am vegan, and I also live in a country where I do not have easy access to ranch mix...which I&#039;m pretty sure also has dairy in it, no? Anyhow, last night I mixed together some fresh Lebanese garlic sauce and grated cucumber and it made an amaaaazing dip for crinkle-cut potato chips. Totally not the same but the spirit of the recipe is intact(ish) and I like it, so. Thanks for the inspiration!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My family has a very unfancy dip that shows up at every gathering, which consists of mayo, sour cream (always Daisy!), grated onion, dried dill and Beau Monde seasoning. It&#039;s very 70s/80s and very midwestern. As am I, for that matter. 
This sounds delicious, I&#039;ll be sure to try it. I used to love Hidden Valley Ranch dressing as a kid, so I&#039;m certain I&#039;ll eat far too much of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mmm. Thank you! I&#039;ve been making this all summer. Tonight I&#039;m adding cayenne and dill and will serve alongside salmon cakes for supper. I&#039;d be happy with potato chips for supper but . . . sticklers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jersey salad dressing recipe???? OMG YES, PLEASE!! We finally made it to Delancy and my husband RAVES about that salad. I love it, too, and our pseudo-vegan girl inhaled the roasted broccoli last weekend when we returned. Love the blog, your writing, Delancy and Essex.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this style of dip....my aunt made it often but always used an envelope of Uncle Dan&#039;s dry dressing mix. Though I love HVR , I almost prefer the UD&#039;s. You should try in and see how it compares...I&#039;d love to know your opinion . When I was a kid, microwaves were all the rage...we&#039;d chop up a white onion , throw it in a boel wuth a brick of cream cheese and zap it till it was warm enough to stir and eat with Ruffles. Mmmmmmmm <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f604.png" alt="ðŸ˜„" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Bam.. Just 2 ingredients <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f645.png" alt="ðŸ™…" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the best goddamn three ingredient dip ever. I love you Molly! What a great one to give us for the 4th of July. I&#039;m already totally addicted to your Granola No. 5 and in fact made a ton of it to give away at our last PTA meeting to ensure people showed up. PTA compliance granola for the win!]]></description>
