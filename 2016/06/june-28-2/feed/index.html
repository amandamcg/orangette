					<description><![CDATA[I always say that Shawshank is my favorite movie. It&#039;s so hard to pick favorites though. It&#039;s my favorite grown up movie. If I had to pick one from my teens, it would be Pump up the Volume because...Christian Slater. Love your blog and I am inspired by your writing. The writing is the least favorite part of my blog, but now I feel inspired to make it better, more personal...not just words to fill my page between photos.]]></description>
