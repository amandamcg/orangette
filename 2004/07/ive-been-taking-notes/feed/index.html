					<description><![CDATA[Damn. It&#039;s almost July 2005, Martine. I suppose you&#039;re just waiting for Molly to come back to Paris before you reply. Or you wandered into some picture packed page here and lost yourself in a haze of sensual fantasy. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;She is long. She is lean. Lovely ain&#039;t the half of it. But comments habits -- lacking. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Maybe when her own book blog goes live, she&#039;ll hup to it. And/or Blogger will learn to notify such folks when comments happen.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;...He probably said to Orangette&#039;s wall.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love comments!  Yaaaay, Martine!  I love Martine!  But, my dear, I have to turn your question right back around: how does a long and lean lovely such as yourself put away so much chocolate?  Hmmm?]]></description>
