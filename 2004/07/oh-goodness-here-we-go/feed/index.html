					<description><![CDATA[I have just started on the long road that is daily blogging and I wondered how long it would take for my voice to be heard.  Quite a few years by the look of it!  Everything develops with time and I am starting right back at the beginning of your trip.  I hope people will also join me on my journey and I look forward to meeting other people right here whose journey I can join.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found this blog recently and I just like reading about this life. I&#039;m an aspiring writer myself (at 14, I&#039;m not sure what that says, but I&#039;m aiming for it anyway). It&#039;s just good to read about your story and how you are still growing as a writer - I guess writers never stop growing.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#039;t know. But keep posting! (I&#039;ve read your more recent posts but have gone back to the first one to comment.) You&#039;ve held out this far - you can hold out some more. :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;m at onlymetoeversee.blogspot.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to let you know that I love your blog! I just started following you for a little while now and it is always a pleasure to read your stories. Just now I had a look at the beginning, to find out that you had made a big decision concerning your PhD just before you started this blog. I just made a big decision concerning a Master programme and after that started my blog as a new &#039;project&#039; to focus on. I love the reading and the writing and you inspire me! I can only hope my blog might bring me just as many good things as yours brought to you. Your book is on my wishlist! Ciao, saluti da Italia!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First off - wow. As an anthropologist major/biology minor who lives to cook and eat as well as read and write about food, let me say it was pretty amazing to find you - like all the planets aligned! You in no uncertain terms, are living my dream. I bought your book to keep myself entertained on a trans-Atlantic flight and delighted at reading the french yogurt cake recipe merely hours after buying my very own french yogurt in a ceramic container - and they laughed at me for keeping it after I had consumed its silky contents!&lt;br /&gt;Your successes have reassured me that doing something you love can truly change everything for the better (with hard work and a bit of luck of course :)&lt;br /&gt;Keep it up and we&#039;re all looking forward to the new book and the Pantry!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been slowly consuming your book for a year now.  Recipe by recipe, I can barely get through a section without heading to the kitchen.  What you need to understand is that I&#039;m a total WING IT girl.  This is the first time I&#039;ve ever repeatedly and religiously followed more than one recipe from a book.  So, thank you.  Those tuna/gouda cheese thingies are still making my mouth water.  And finally, someone with an adequate respect for ginger in baking.  Ahhhhh.  As I just started blogging on growing and processing food for our family (and other dramatic details of life on the farm), I thought I would check out your initial post.  What a ride.  Congratulations to you. And thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;br /&gt;I am a local Ballard girl myself and I read about you this morning on KOMO. I have recently gone back to school for my engineering degree, but I am finding that my homework seems to be taking second to my love of baking. This is the first time in my life that I have had a little time for myself. I am just beginning to read your blog and I am very excited! Congratulations on your success. I can&#039;t wait until Amazon deliver your book.&lt;br /&gt;Kelly]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So as I read through your first blog postings, I realized that I not only was not the first person to feel the pull of reading your early work after reading your book.  And then I found that I&#039;m also not the first person to note that they aren&#039;t the first person.  Alas... you&#039;ll get no new perspectives from me on your honest and beautiful and enviable writing, or &quot;can&#039;t wait to try that&quot; recipe, or touching personal history through cooking and eating.  I will say that your ability to take a reader into a moment of your life, make us feel like we are standing there with you in your kitchen as you stain a favorite shirt because you just had to roast or toast or braise or saute something, is truly a gift.  So forgive me that it took several years for me to find this blog.  And thank you - this is just what I need now.]]></description>
