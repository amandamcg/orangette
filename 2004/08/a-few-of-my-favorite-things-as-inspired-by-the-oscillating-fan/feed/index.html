					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;ve been shadow-following your blog for a while now, and couldn&#039;t stay quiet any longer. My lips are still sticky with plum juice from the torte (it&#039;s &quot;zwetschgen&quot; season here in Germany) that I made tonight, attacking it with my bare hands while it was still warm. Bliss at 2am.&lt;br /&gt;Each recipe I&#039;ve tried off this blog has got us all (me, my husband, and everyone who eats with us) oooh-ing and aah-ing about your magic. AND your blogs make us smile too!! It&#039;s almost too much. &lt;br /&gt;Just a long way of saying thank you.&lt;br /&gt;- Trushna]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These oatmeal cookies are great - a little too much chocolate for my own taste, but my children certainly didn&#039;t think so. The recipe can be slightly modified to make terrific oatmeal ginger cookies too - just substitute finely chopped stem ginger (I used 8 pieces from the jar) for the chocolate at the final stage of the mix.]]></description>
