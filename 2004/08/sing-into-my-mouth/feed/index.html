					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I was at the same show in 2004!  He brings tears to my eyes, too!  I met him at a book signing a couple of years earlier, and realized that there was a God from that experience onward.  I am with you in complete and total love and admiration for this beautiful man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was living in L.A. and two days post-surgery and on all fours (almost), crept to see his &quot;Rei Momo&quot; concert.  Nothing short of apocalyptic earthquakes could have kept me from that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will ALWAYS be inclined to comment when I read such words of praise for him.  Please try to see him soon at the Paramount!  Tickets are still available...]]></description>
