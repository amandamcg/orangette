    <p>Sundays are nice. My <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a></em> and I are very cozy on the couch.</p>
<p>Last night Kate and I made dinner and watched the boats sail in and out of Elliott Bay from her 18th-floor downtown apartment. It was an excellent reason to eat lots of <strong>bittersweet chocolate and Plugra</strong>, but you can rest assured that we ate our vegetables first.</p>
<p>We traipsed down to Pike Place Market just before closing and snatched up a bell pepper, red and gold tomatoes, a cucumber, two yams, and three sausages from Uli’s: spinach bratwurst, hot Italian, and lamb. Back home, we opened a bottle of white that happened to be lurking in the fridge, and, glasses in hand, put our bare feet up on the railing of her balcony to catch up for a while. There was much girly locker-room talk, and a pearl earring was nearly lost but wasn’t.</p>
<p>Then dinner threw itself together gracefully. The yams were sliced into long, flat fingers and roasted with olive oil, salt and pepper. The pepper and tomatoes were likewise dressed, then tossed onto the grill with the sausages, which sputtered at the heat and quickly began to glisten. The cucumber was sliced into rounds, tossed with vinaigrette and torn basil leaves from Kate’s thriving balcony garden. Meanwhile, the boats sailed on, and soon the cake came forth, trailing in its wake a bowlful of loosely whipped cream. We had two servings each, and poor Kate had to lie on the floor afterwards. It was really something.</p>
<p>And so, with no further ado, the recipe.</p>

      <div class="recipe-list">
                                <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            7 ounces (200 grams) best-quality dark chocolate          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            7 ounces (200 grams) unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 1/3 cup (250 grams) granulated sugar          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            5 large eggs          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 Tbs unbleached all-purpose flour          </div>
                  </div>
  
      <div itemprop="instructions">
      <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and butter an 8-inch round cake pan. Line the base of the pan with parchment, and butter the parchment too.</p>
<p>Finely chop the chocolate (a serrated bread knife does an outstanding job of this) and melt it gently with the butter in a double boiler or in the microwave, stirring regularly to combine. Add the sugar to the chocolate-butter mixture, stirring well, and set aside to cool for a few moments. The mixture will look gritty. Then add the eggs one by one, stirring well after each addition &#8211; the mixture will look slimy &#8211; and then add the flour. Mix until the batter no longer looks slimy but instead smooth, dark, and utterly gorgeous.</p>
<p>Pour batter into the buttered cake pan and bake for approximately 25 minutes, or until the center of the cake looks set and the top is shiny and a bit crackly-looking. (I usually set the timer for 20 minutes initially, and then I check the cake every two minutes thereafter until it’s done. At 20 minutes, it’s usually quite jiggly in the center. You’ll know it’s done when it jiggles only VERY slightly, if at all. It&#8217;s hard to overbake this cake.)</p>
<p>Let the cake cool in its pan on a rack for 15 minutes; then carefully turn the cake out of the pan and revert it, so that the crackly side is facing upward. Allow to cool completely. The cake will deflate slightly as it cools.</p>
<p>Serve in wedges at room temperature with a loose dollop of ever-so-slightly sweetened whipped cream.</p>
<p>Note: This cake is even better on the second day, so consider making it the day before serving. And thank you to Clotilde of <a href="http://www.chocolateandzucchini.com/">Chocolate &amp; Zucchini</a>, whose mention of a clementine cake in Trish Deseine’s <em><a href="http://www.fnac.com/Shelf/article.asp?Mn=1&amp;SID=bbe8275e-c642-d801-09e2-6c6b9b109514&amp;TTL=240920040554&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;Origin=FnacAff&amp;PRID=1465136&amp;Ra=-1&amp;To=0&amp;Nu=1&amp;UID=0845835eb-a89d-ebc2-bc9a-10e3422c9b03&amp;Fr=-1">Mes petits plats préférés</a></em> led to my stumbling upon <em>Je veux du chocolat!</em> in the bookstore one day.</p>

      <p>I made this cake over xmas for family and being the midwesterners that they were I think the richness AND the lack of cloying sweetness kept them from raving.  Oh well, I enjoyed it mightily.  🙂  BTW, I got my recipe from Nigella&#8217;s &#8220;how to be a domestic goddess&#8221; and its identical to what you have printed, so the formula has definitely made the rounds.</p>

      <p>Oh, Molly, Molly &#8230; I&#8217;ve got another one for you.  I went to a potluck in Williamsburg/Greenpoint tonight.  I wanted to take something delicious but low on the labor scale.  Seems this baby fits the bill, yes?</></>Well, it fell together with almost no work at all, but something went very, very awry at the &#8220;turn the cake out of the pan immediately&#8221; stage.  I can&#8217;t figure out what happened really.  My best guess is my oven is hotter than it says it is &#8230; I&#8217;m more a cook than a baker so I&#8217;ve yet to invest in an oven thermometer.  The top looked beautiful, the cake had just a flirty sort of jiggle to it.  But when I flipped it over &#8212; there were some funny little craters in the bottom/now top, and a small hunk of it stuck to the pan, and it lacked a certain &#8230; hmmmm &#8230; uniformity?  It was a bit &#8230; well &#8230; sort of Ms. Havisham sad.</></>I screamed and laughed and my roommate took photos.  We flipped it many times using all the big flat things we could find in the kitchen, and I even burned two fingers on my left hand when some goopy innards dripped out in protest.  Pretty it was not.</></>I wasn&#8217;t too concerned though &#8230; chocolate, butter, what&#8217;s not to love?</></>And indeed, it floored people at the party.  &#8220;What IS this?&#8221; and &#8220;Oh my GODWHOMADETHIS???!?&#8221; and &#8220;I have never tasted anything like this in my life.  Ever.  Ever.&#8221;</></>So thank you.</></>peace</>Lisa</p>

      <p>Lisa, you kill me every time. Thank <>you<>, my dear! I&#8217;m so glad to hear that my beloved &#8220;winning hearts and minds&#8221; cake didn&#8217;t let you down, even if was a little stubborn in stages. A few notes in response to your crises:</>-I too have had funny craters form on the underside of mine&#8211;not from the cake sticking to the pan, but from air bubbles or something. I&#8217;ve never been able to figure out what causes them, but luckily, when you flip the cake right side up, they&#8217;re hidden.</>-As for the trickiness of all that inverting and reverting, here&#8217;s what I do. When I pull the cake out of the oven, I put a sheet of aluminum foil over it, and then I put a plate, upside-down, on top of the foil. [I find that the foil helps keep the cake from sticking to the plate.] Using oven mitts, I hold the cake pan and the plate together and quickly flip them. I remove the pan, leaving the cake upside-down on the foil-covered plate. Then I put a second plate upside-down on top of the cake, wedge two fingers between the plates to keep from squashing the cake, and flip the plates, so that the cake is once more facing up. Remove the foil, and taaa daaa! You&#8217;ve got a cake on a plate, right side up, with no burnt fingers or kitchen tools necessary.</p>

      <p>Ah ha!  But the thing is: if I had properly read your instructions &#8212; that is, had I reverted instead of inverted (back into the pan, mind you, as this cake had to swipe her Metrocard for a little trip on the L) &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t have such a great story.

      <p>Hiya 🙂 Just a wee note before I run off: I made this again, this afternoon, with nary a hitch!  Your foil &#038; plates advice was really just the thing.  It&#8217;ll be my offering at a farewell dinner a friend is making for me &#8212; she&#8217;s making something Japanese that I will remember the name for after I eat it, and I come with this.  She&#8217;s doing an apprenticeship at Payard on the Upper East Side but is as unassuming and welcoming as can be, so I&#8217;m not <>too<> nervous about bringing dessert.</></>peace</>Lisa</p>

      <p>Molly, I recently discovered your site and I was completely overwrought by the pure hedonistic decadence of your pictures. So much so that I was seduced into making this chocolate cake (more a fabulously rich ganache masquerading as a cake, really)for a someone who&#8217;s off to France. You should have heard the sounds of pleasure 5s after tasting their first mouthful. Someone even said that he&#8217;d travel to eat a slice of this.</></>I baked my cake in a buttered springform pan and let it cool in it on a rack. A thought &#8211; what do you think of lining the bottom of the pan with parchment to make it a little easier to remove the cake in future?</></>Thanks for the recipe and I am also enjoying your writing immensely.</></>Flora</p>

      <p>Lisa, I&#8217;m honored to know that the winning-hearts-and-minds cake made an appearance at your farewell dinner!  I&#8217;m not so happy, though, about the farewell part.  Hmph.  Good luck to you, my dear, and hope to hear from you soon&#8230;</></>And Flora, thank you for your very generous compliments!  I&#8217;m always delighted to meet another fan of this chocolate cake.  And as for the parchment idea, certainly, you could give it a go.  I have never really had trouble with my cake sticking to the pan, but I have talked to others who have, and either way, the parchment is a good back-up measure.  Thank you for suggesting it.</p>

      <p>Dear sweet <>Jee-bus<>. Christ on a crutch and Sweet Fancy Moses wrapped up in a cocoa butter blanket. I just made this for the weekly Yay-it&#8217;s-Friday-we&#8217;re-kinda-Jewish-let&#8217;s-Have-a-Big-Shabbos meal. Good lord this cake is&#8230; well, how dare it be this good is all I can say. The nerve of it. I&#8217;ll never bake another kind of cake again, ever, I think. I just had two pieces. The first was dessert; the second was pure gluttony and I am now on the sofa groaning and sort of medicating self with cold white wine. If I live, I will never forget the favor you&#8217;ve done the world posting this recipe.</p>

      <p>I am a blog posting virgin, so here goes nothing.</></>This cake looks divine. I have a recipe almost identical- for Molten Chocolate cakes. If you are interested in a warm version of this cake, it&#8217;s chocolate goodness spilling out with your first delectable bite, then read on. </></>They get rave reviews every time-  The main change in the recipe is use only 1/2 C sugar and 1 C unsalted butter. Use greased muffin cups or ramekins instead of a cake pan, and bake for about 9 minutes at 450 degrees F, or until the edges are set but there is a jiggly spot in the center. Overturn on plates and serve immediately with cream and sugared rasberries.</p>

      <p>Oh my gosh, Tracy, I&#8217;m so sorry!  What a mess &#8211; and on New Year&#8217;s Eve, too!  I&#8217;m impressed that you persevered and went on to make the sour cream banana cake &#8211; three cheers for you, lady!  But as for this cake and its collapsing, hmmm.  I&#8217;ve never had mine collapse, although it does sometimes rise a bit while baking, souffle-like, and then sink a little upon cooling.  But even counting that, it still winds up looking pretty much the same every time.  Say, do you have an oven thermometer?  I keep one in my oven at all times, and I recommend it to nearly everyone who crosses my path. Most ovens, mine included, are never quite the temperature that you set them to be.  I wonder if your oven might be a little off?  That could explain why the cake took so very long to bake, at least.  Lastly, did you cut into the cake and/or taste it?  How did it look inside?  It&#8217;s supposed to be a fairly fudgy &#8211; even bordering on gooey &#8211; cake, and sometimes, mine have looked a little messy or collapse-y.  Keep that in mind. </></>I hope that helps at least a little.  Happy New Year to you and yours!</p>

      <p>Hi Molly &#8211; yup, the oven temperature was checked, double-checked, and triple-checked, so I don&#8217;t think that was it&#8230;not sure what it was, but when I flipped the cake it was okay and then when I re-inverted it, it just went SPLAT!!!

      <p>Hi C. &#8211;</>&#8220;1 Tbs&#8221; means one tablespoon.  I&#8217;m not sure where you live, but in French, for example, a tablespoon is called <>une cuillere a soupe<>.  In weight, a tablespoon of flour weighs anywhere between 7 and 10 grams, depending on how you pack it.  This cake is fairly forgiving, so it would be hard to go wrong.  Good luck!</p>

      <p>Sadly, my experience today mirrors anonymous above! I&#8217;m so bummed.  No oven thermometer it&#8217;s true, but I bake a lot, so don&#8217;t suspect my oven&#8217;s too far off. It&#8217;s mostly a puddle. Tragic really, indoor picnic at the symphony tonight &amp; this is what I was going to bring😥. Been planning since I read your book.

      <p>Sarah, I&#8217;m so sorry that happened!  It sounds underbaked, that&#8217;s all.  When I make this cake today, I bake it until it looks set, with really no jiggle at all &#8211; so if you ever feel brave enough to try again, please be sure to bake it until it reaches that point.  It&#8217;s hard to overtake.  I&#8217;ll reread my instructions above to make sure that&#8217;s clear.  Thank you!</p>

      <p>Hi all&#8211;I had this experience too, after making it countless times with no issues, and I did some thinking. I was at a different altitude when it didn&#8217;t work! I am going to test out some versions with some high altitude adjustments (increase oven temperature, decrease baking time, decrease sugar, add eggs for liquid, and add a little extra flour) and I&#8217;ll report back with my results.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve baked a similar recipe (The Oaxaqueño Fondant). It went pretty well in my gas oven, but I had the same too-gooey-center issues when I tried to bake it in an electric one.</></>I tried one of the usual fondant tricks then, and it worked: you just chill your pan and batter in the fridge for about 10 minutes, just before you put it in the oven. The sudden change of temperature will help the batter to bake evenly.</p>

      <p>a sign of a good post, and a good recipe, is one that keeps on resurrecting, time and again. this one&#8217;s been running for over 2 years now&#8230; WOW!</></>i&#8217;ve made a similar cake before, i know this as &#8216;Almost-flourless chocolate cake&#8217;.</></>hmm&#8230; i hear you on those bottom indentations on cakes&#8230; my theory is that it could be caused by hot spots&#8230; i notice it tend to happen when i don&#8217;t use baking parchment to line my cakes. except for silicone pans which i use with a baking sheet, i prefer using parchment, easier clean-up, and the bottom doesn&#8217;t get too dry or toasted.</></>flopping in the middle as mentioned, supposing the eggs have really been blended in very well, may have been caused by a too-hot oven. the outside cooks so much faster, leaving the middle too gooey. </></>is it possible that a different type of oven was used by others? one of those convection-fan ovens&#8230; which calls for recipes to lower the required temperature by around 25C? or will a bain-marie help? </></>or just cool and refrigerate the whole thing until the chocolately center firms up&#8230; get a few spoons and dig in! =D</></>now, you&#8217;re making me crave chocolate. two years after posting.</p>

      <p>Where I live, I was unable to find a cake pan the right size for this recipe. The smallest was 10 1/2 inches. So I multiplied the measurements of the recipe by 1.5 (300 gr butter, 300 gr chocolate,&#8230; 7 eggs). Also, I didn&#8217;t have access to unbleached flour. I thought about substituting all purpose white but after I read about the problems some of you had with the center texture, some hunch led me to use whole wheat flour instead. Whole wheat flour needs to sit in liquid for about an hour to perform like white flour, so I let my 1 1/2 Tbsp flour sit with 7 beaten eggs in the fridge. </></>The cooking temperature was the same, but the time came to about 30 minutes. </></>The result was wonderful! I made this as part of a birthday meal for my husband. Another part was his beloved blackberry pie. He thought that the pie was great but this cake was fabulous! </></>Now, I did have problem reverting but it is not something I cannot deal with next time. I was very tired at that point and misjudged the centering of the cake on the cake stand. A very small sliver of cake flopped off onto the counter. </></>Since my cake was bigger than all the plates we have, I used a floppy plastic cutting board while reverting. This made wax paper unnecessary. </></>If I ever get my hands on a smaller pie pan I will experiment with this using fructose rather than sugar. This should make the cake have a fairly lower glycemic index without any compromise from taste. </></>Thank you Molly for sharing this wonderful recipe. Mark thought I gave him the best birthday meal. I can&#8217;t wait for your book. </></>Yums,</></>Eden</p>

      <p>Vida, I&#8217;m woefully late in responding to your comment &#8211; oof! &#8211; but I wanted to thank you for sharing that trick.  I hadn&#8217;t heard of doing that before, but it sounds very promising!  I&#8217;ll most definitely give it a try, and I hope other readers will too.</></>Kayenne, as always, your thoughts and suggestions are so smart.  I&#8217;ve been working on a version of this cake for the book, and I was thinking of calling for the pan to be lined with parchment paper, mainly to prevent any stickage.  But now that you mention the hot spots, wow, it would terrific if the parchment would help with that too.  Brandon and I are also considering using this cake &#8211; or, rather, 30 of them! &#8211; as our wedding cake, and it would be nice to avoid those craters on the underside or other inconsistencies.  I&#8217;m going to be testing it in coming weeks, and I&#8217;m eager to see what happens.</></>And Eden, what ingenious improvising you did!  I&#8217;m very impressed.  Thank you for sharing your thoughts and tweaks &#8211; and happy belated birthday to your husband!</p>

      <p>This cake is the bomb. I&#8217;ve used Maida Heatter&#8217;s recipe and find that her tips are great: butter the pan, line it with parchment paper, butter the parchment paper and &#8220;flour&#8221; it with a 50-50 combination of flour and cocoa powder (so that you don&#8217;t get an ugly greasy white film on the top of your cake), bake in a bain marie, unmold after a 10 minute cooling time, refrigerate overnight, then remove the parchment paper and dust on some cocoa &#8211; it genuinely does taste better the next day.</></>Molly, thanks for your site, you are an inspiration.</p>

      <p>regarding the goopy cakes: i always end up cooking mine about 10 minutes longer than the recipe says &#8211;   sometimes more.  i open the oven and give it a nudge, and if any more than about a 2-inch diameter section in the middle jiggles, i leave it for another three minutes.  this means that the outside is often a little drier than i&#8217;d like, but i&#8217;ve never had a problem with it turning into a puddle.  and besides, the dryness is a nice foil for the silky middle and the whipped cream (i usually make bourbon whipped cream for this!)</p>

      <p>Molly,</></>I stumbled onto this recipe yesterday afternoon and had to make this. Had no ingredients on hand because we just moved, so made a special trip to buy everything.</></>Here&#8217;s a few tips that worked for me&#8230;.I microwaved the butter in a big bowl, then just added the chocolate as I chopped it, so by the time I added the last handful of chocolate, all I had to do was stir a few times to blend&#8230;it was all evenly melted.</></>However, I couldn&#8217;t find my regular baking pan, so substituted a fry-pan with sloping sides. This meant the middle was a bit thicker than it would have been, so the cake needed to cook longer. I took it out after a half hour, but it was still smooth in the center. We went off to dinner and when we got home I checked it and did the knife test. A bit too gooey. So, I threw it back in the oven, and kept checking it, and about ten minutes later, the middle puffed up, soufflee-like and was all crackly, which I figured was about perfect.</></>I wanted to cool it for about a half hour, but every five minutes, my boyfriend asked if it was ready yet, so we dove in after about 15 minutes when it was still nice and warm and deliciously gooey.</></>Even though I&#8217;d shown him the picture of this cake, Steve didn&#8217;t quite realize what I was making, until he took a bite. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize you were making THAT cake.&#8221; He said, very impressed. </></>It was a huge hit!</></>🙂 Pam</p>

      <p>molly!  i made this cake this morning and alas I had some of the same Splat! problems the other posters did! clearly i need to learn to read the comments first..  i baked for ~30 min in a 9 inch pan, and when to flip it out immediately i just spilled all over my counter&#8230;.  I think i should have maybe cooked it a bit longer and then put the plate on top, and flipped 180 degrees more carefully, instead of trying to flip it out like a normal cake. and maybe have cooled in the pan for a few minutes? Anyways&#8211; i will enjoying eating all my gooey chocolate bits today and attempt the cake again asap.  also&#8211; made the lemon yogurt cake last night&#8211; delicious success!</p>

      <p>AMAZING! It came out of the oven at 3pm and went straight to the freezer in foil until dinner started at 5:30. I took it out to sit during the meal and it was perfect for dishing by dessert! My mother asked for only a small slice, as she&#8217;s not a huge chocolate lover, then promptly dished herself another within minutes. I took the leftovers to the neighbors because I was certain I&#8217;d finish the plate myself, and got an almost immediate phone call telling me they wouldn&#8217;t even share it with their kids and needed the recipe. I&#8217;m already craving another. Thanks for a fabulous and simple dessert! (Oh, and although I used great chocolate, I used regular salted grocery store butter.)</p>

      <p>hi molly!  i&#8217;ve been reading your blog since august and am loving every bit of it, so thank you so much.  most of all, it&#8217;s helped re-inspire my motivation to overcome my fear of baking!  i was steadily making progress and then we moved to a new house with electric appliances and i had to learn all over again and largely had given up&#8230; but no longer!  🙂</></>*ahem* well, since you seem to check back and respond to comments sometimes, i have a question about this cake.  i&#8217;m in the process of baking it and i think it&#8217;s going to be amazing, but do you think it&#8217;s possible to make it gluten-free?  it&#8217;s so close to gf except for that one tablespoon of flour!  can it be omitted or replaced?</p>

      <p>Roula, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re overcoming your fear of baking!  HOORAY!  And as for this cake, yes, it&#8217;s very easy to go a gluten-free version.  Instead of 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, you can use 1 tablespoon of most any gluten-free flour &#8211; or even 1 tablespoon cocoa.  I&#8217;ve made this for my friend Shauna, who has celiac disease, and I find that cocoa is the easiest way for me.  (I don&#8217;t always have a gf flour on hand.)  </></>Hope that helps!</p>

      <p>oh wow, cocoa is such a good idea &#8212; some of my favorite desserts use both cocoa and solid chocolate to make sort of a rounder, multi-faceted chocolate taste, so i bet the cocoa substitution might even be a secret weapon.  thank you!  </></>and is that the celiac shauna who writes glutenfreegirl?  i found her blog after a good friend discovered she had celiac disease, which incidentally was the reason for my question to you.  this friend is as much of a chocoholic as it sounds like you are, especially since her diagnosis  as it has ruled out a lot of other sweets.  </></>sorry this is getting so long; my last to-do item is to thank you again for this cake!  it turned out fabulous and i still can&#8217;t believe how easy it was.  this is *exactly* the kind of occasional confidence-booster that keeps a wary baker going.  </></>ps &#8211; even the batter was tasty (albeit a little raw-egg-mucus-tasting)&#8230;</p>

      <p>Charlotte, I would suggest keeping the cake at room temperature.  That&#8217;s what I do, and so long as it&#8217;s going to be eaten within a couple of days, it&#8217;s fine.  Plus, its texture is best at room temperature. (If you put it in the fridge, you have to pull it out several hours before serving, which is kind of a pain; straight from the fridge, it&#8217;s too dense and cold.)   </></>If you want to freeze it, simply wrap the fully cooled cake in plastic wrap and then again in foil.  (This is easiest if you put the cake on a cardboard round; then you can move it and wrap it easily without mangling it.  I either buy cardboard cake rounds from a kitchen supply company or make them myself, from cardboard boxes.  I don&#8217;t know if this helps, but < HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/molly_orangette/846369846/in/set-72157600315173418/" REL="nofollow">here<>&#8216;s a picture of one of our wedding cakes on its cardboard round, in mid-wrap.)  You can freeze it that way indefinitely.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly,</></>Thank you so much for this recipe and the tip on how to make it gluten-free (GF) by using 1 T of cocoa instead of flour.  If you can&#8217;t have flour, might as well have cocoa, right?  🙂</></>I am getting married to the most wonderful man this October and keep trying chocolate cake after chocolate cake with no success.  My hope is that your&#8217;s will be the ticket to a cake that I can use as a tiered wedding cake.  If you have any thoughts or recommendations, please let me know!</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve made this cake easily a dozen times since I first read the recipe a couple of years ago.  But I upped the ante and used you for inspiration recently, and made nine of them for my wedding this past May.  Everyone thought I was crazy for doing it&#8211; &#8220;you&#8217;ll be too stressed!&#8221; so I stopped telling people :).  </></>I recently got a call from the caterer saying that a handful of dessert plates were missing from our returns.  I mentioned it to my husband, and he said, &#8220;oh yeah, people were taking extra pieces of cake home on the plates.  Your cousin even wrapped a piece in a napkin and stuck it in her purse to bring home to her husband.&#8221;  It was a hit.  </></>Thank you so much for sharing the recipe, for sharing how you made and stored these for your wedding, and for setting in to motion an absolutely delicious wedding cake!</p>

      <p>Molly,- Your cake looks like it&#8217;ll be amazing- and may even be my saving grace.  My daughter is getting married in 3weeks exactly, and she just lost the baker of her wedding cake.  The cake looks like it will be straight-forward to make, but can you maybe show a picture of how your wedding cake was decorated and presented?  I&#8217;d so appreciate it since I am hosting the wedding in my back yard, and making the favors.  There will be approximately 240 people at the reception, can you tell me, is it around 20 that I need to make too?  </>By the way, I found your site today and just started reading and reading, I love your writing and appreciation for all things sinfully decadent as well as your sense of humor.  Your book is one that I definitely need to get.  Thanks for the recipe!</></>Laura</p>

      <p>Laura, this cake is very straightforward, and it was a <>huge<> hit at our wedding!  < HREF="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2007/08/so-we-feasted.html" REL="nofollow">Here<> is a photograph of the way it was displayed (scroll down).  We chose not to decorate it too much; our caterers simply put a few of the cakes on ceramic cake stands and topped them with roses.  (The rest of the cakes were in the kitchen.)  To serve them, the caterers cut the cakes into slices of varying sizes (because the cake is rich, it was nice for there to be some smaller pieces) and arranged them on a table, and people came and selected the size they wanted.  We also served ice cream, which the caterers scooped to order, but unsweetened (or lightly sweetened) whipped cream would be lovely too.</></>As for the number you&#8217;ll need to make, well, each cake serves 8 to 10, so if I were you, I would make 30 cakes.  It sounds like a lot, but if you start making them now and freeze them, it shouldn&#8217;t be too terrible a task.  I made all 20 of ours on my own, moving at a pretty relaxed pace over the course of a few days.  Just be sure to remove them from the freezer 24 hours in advance, so that they can come fully to room temperature before you serve them.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly,</></>When I discovered your site back in March of 08 I read the ENTIRE thing and emailed myself this recipe. It&#8217;s been sitting in my inbox since, but I finally made it this weekend when a friend was visiting from across the country. This cake is so wonderful! I used GF flour since she has celiac and I found that my cake was &#8220;quite jiggly&#8221; even after a good 35 minutes &#8211; it&#8217;s possible my oven wasn&#8217;t hot enough but I was surprised at how long it took to set. Maybe if I had used cocoa instead of gf flour&#8230; but I had to go to Whole Foods to find European style butter anyway (my local market doesn&#8217;t carry it) so I grabbed a bag of gf flour, too. Anyway, she was touched that there was a desert she could eat, so thanks a lot for the recipe 🙂</p>

      <p>Something has definitely gone awry&#8230; But let me start from the beginning. I woke up this morning and decided I would bake a cake for a BBQ tomorrow. This may have been my first mistake, since my right hand is broken and wrapped in a not-so-stylish cast. I should also say that since the break I have not acclimated to the world as a lefty. But I&#8217;m a sucker for this cake and I decided to push on through&#8230; I&#8217;ve made it many times before, how hard could it be? Hard, actually.</>The second mistake was doubling the recipe (two cakes are always better than one) without two cake pans. This left me to &#8220;eye out&#8221; the amount of batter that qualified as half, something I&#8217;m notoriously bad at. When the amount seemed about right, I popped it in the oven and crossed my fingers. </>For a while it was touch-and-go, but by 20 minutes I thought things were shaping up nicely. When I came back at 22 a clear liquid was pooling on top of the cake. Trying not to panic, I let the cake bake for another couple of minutes until a toothpick came out clean and then pulled it out hoping the clear liquid would seep back into the cake as it cooled. </>It did, and though I knew something was strange, I decided to go ahead and flip the cake. So there I am with an oven mitt on my left hand and another awkwardly shoved over my cast. I went for it. In one slow motion, I flipped half of the cake onto the plate and half of into onto the floor. For a second, I actually thought I was going to cry. But then I did the only logical thing I could do&#8230; I got out a fork and took a few bites.</></>Now I&#8217;m off to clean up the remains and bake cake number two&#8230; This time I&#8217;m waiting for my hubby to get home to do the flip! The good news is, this cake is so delicious it was worth the trouble 🙂</p>

      <p>Oh, Good Heavens!  I made this cake the day before a dinner party that my Mom and I were having.  It almost didn&#8217;t make it to the party.  If I had had enough ingredients to make a second cake, I probably would have dived right into it with a fork all by my self!!! Everyone loved, loved, loved it!  It will be difficult for me to ever make any other cake.</>Many Thanks!</p>

      <p>Christy, yes, it will work with regular butter.  When I posted this recipe &#8211; I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been over four years now! &#8211; I had only made it with European butter, but I have now made it with regular butter on a number of occasions, and it work just fine.  In fact, I made it with regular butter for our wedding!  Also, the Ghirardelli 60% chips work beautifully for this!  I&#8217;ve made it with them many, many times.</p>

      <p>One more question&#8230; I&#8217;m right in the middle of making it now,  and noticed when I added the sugar to the chocolate and stirred and stirred, it is still very grainy from the sugar.  Is it supposed to dissolve?

      <p>Christy, you&#8217;re in luck!  I happened to be sitting at my computer when your comment came in.  Anyway, yes, your batter is fine.  The batter does get quite grainy when you add the sugar, but after you&#8217;ve added the eggs and flour, it will be much smoother.  So don&#8217;t worry.  Oh, and when you stir in the eggs, don&#8217;t worry if it looks gross and slimy; just keep stirring!  By the time you&#8217;ve added all the eggs and the flour, it should come together into a very smooth, lovely batter.</p>

      <p>Molly &#8211; I&#39;m an Australian living in London and absolutely love my food.  I found your blog a few weeks ago and have just finished reading your new book.  You have such a fantastic writing style.  It feels like having a good chat with a good friend about stuff I love when I read your blog. The photos are fantastic too.  Getting back to the point, I made this cake on the weekend and am about to eat the last piece now.  It was so simple and delicious.  We served it with some Green &#038; Black white chocolate and raspberry ice cream and I think it will also be fantastic with a berry sorbet when the English summer berries start to come out.  All the best getting Delancy&#39;s ready &#8211; something tells me that you and Brandon are going to be just fine.</>Jen</p>

      <p>Molly,</></>I made this cake last night, and I have to say it was incredible! </></>I&#8217;ve got a question though, next week is Passover and I&#8217;m curious if you have any insight into substituting for the tbsp. of flour so that it could come with me to a seder.  Would using potato starch work just as well, you think?  I know this lovely would be drooled over to no end if there was a way to make it wheat flour free!</></>Thanks,</>Rifka</p>

      <p>Rifka, I don&#8217;t have much experience with potato starch, so I&#8217;m not sure what to tell you there.  But I have made this cake a couple of times for a friend who cannot eat gluten, and instead of the flour, I used 1 Tbsp. of unsweetened cocoa.  Works like a charm.  You might try that!</p>

      <p>Hi Stephanie &#8212; not to speak on Molly&#39;s behalf, but I have made this cake roughly 817 times, with Plugra and Valrhona chocolate and with Kroger butter and Trader Joe&#39;s chocolate.  Delicious every time.</p>

      <p>Seems totally gratuitous to add yet another comment but I have to let you know my husband declared this the best cake he&#39;d ever had when I first made it a couple months back, so I decided to make it again to celebrate the arrival of our first, Henry.  It will always have a special place in our family history.  <br />I&#39;m a recent but devoted fan- given your book as a gift three times already and probably will again soon.

      <p>Molly, I just have to tell you that my contribution &#8211; your Winning Hearts-And-Minds cake &#8211; to our get-together with family friends yesterday went down a hit, to my great surprise&#8230;they&#39;re the first midwesterners I&#39;ve met who haven&#39;t screwed their noses up at dark chocolate (my husband&#39;s family ate my version of Nigella Lawson&#39;s Torta Alla Gianduia in polite silence &#8211; their next birthday cake will be a cloyingly sweet clod of dry sponge from King Soopers!! :P).  There wasn&#39;t a crumb left by the end of the evening.  In fact, it received the ultimate compliment from their 16-year old son, that I just had to pass on: &#8220;I am *so* not worthy of this cake&#8230;&#8221;  Your friend Kate titled the cake perfectly.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already made this cake the normal way and it did, indeed, everything you claimed it would do.<br />But tonight &#8211; and I&#39;m not sure that the original can be improved upon, so maybe this was just a lateral move to something different but equally good &#8211; my neighbor&#39;s fig tree dropped 8ish figs into my driveway. I pureed them and stuck them in with the chocolate and&#8230;. well&#8230; you should try it. 🙂</p>

      <p>I ended up making three of these cakes for my husband&#39;s b-day after reading about it in your book. It was delicious. I used different chocolates and I did like the more expensive chocolate better. In one cake I even used one chocolate bar with chile pepper and cinnamon. I  liked all the variations. Like I said I made three because the first one I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to wrap and place in the freezer and I ended up eating it all by myself! I found there is a difference in stirring with a spoon or using a whisk and I found stirring with a spoon the results were more like you described and took less time to bake meaning the jiggle was less. Does that make sense? Thank you for your delicious recipe!It was a hit at the party and made the day easier since I made it ahead of time</p>

      <p>I love this cake and have made it many times, but the cake ends up shaped like a mushroom, overhanging the edges of the pan, but much higher on the sides than in the middle.  I use an 8&#8243; X 1 1/2&#8243; aluminum cake pan, and have tried a 9&#8243;; that came out too flat.  I noticed in the picture it does have higher sides, but not nearly as high as mine.  Should I be looking for a deeper cake pan?  As everyone here has said, the cake is always such a hit, but I could never call mine gorgeous&#8230;</p>

      <p>Judy, I do think the solution is a deeper cake pan.  I use an 8-inch pan with sides that are 2 inches high, and when it bakes, the cake rises right up to the top.  (Then it sinks down a bit as it cools.)  With a pan that&#39;s less deep, you could definitely wind up with a weird mushroom effect&#8230;</p>

    <div class="comment--content">
      <p>Dear Molly,</p>
<p>I have wanted to post a comment for some time now after stumbling across your book. Reading the cover flap, I was struck by several parallels, feeling as though I was reading about my life, my thoughts about my place in the world.  I devoured your book and, throughout the course of this past summer, many of your recipes. But now I finally feel compelled to &#8220;take the plunge,&#8221; and post on your blog. </p>
<p>I too am a child of a subsequent marriage, my father&#39;s third. I always felt blessed to have a man of such character, generosity, wisdom, even stubbornness as my father-a man full of life fifty years my elder. Even and especially after his death from cancer seven years ago. Your memories of watching your strong, vivacious father become weak with disease brought back so much from that time in my life. </p>
<p>Food, food preparation, and meals have also always been the central fixture of my family, holding my family together through thick and thin. We live, breath and dream about food. </p>
<p>Another facet of your book spoke to me as well. I also find myself at a sort of crossroads, trying to figure out exactly what path I want to follow, what shape I want my life to take. I just graduated from college. Thankfully, I received a yearlong travel fellowship to carry out my proposal- exploring food and death ritual and customs in central Mexico. I am a proud new resident of Cholula, Mexico. I am grateful to have some time to contemplate my next step. As you related your life-changing experience in Paris in your book, for me, travel has always meant time for reflection, for self-nurturing, for broadening my world view and at times, making those decisions that change, in some way, life waiting back home. I simply want to thank you for publishing a book that speaks to me at this time in my life, giving me an example of someone who has made a major, and ultimately fulfilling, life decision and has come out on the other side! Maybe up to your eyeballs in pizza dough, but living life!</p>
<p>Finally, after this long-winded introduction, my excuse for posting! I love this cake, love love love this cake. I decided I had to make it for my wonderful landlord’s birthday, a self-proclaimed <i>pastelera</i> (lover of all things sweet). I remembered the online recipe listing ingredients in grams, making it much easier to buy at my local <i>mercado</i>. An oven thermometer or measuring cups cannot be found in this tiny town, where mothers and <i>abuelas</i> cook by taste, smell, sight and memory. I weighed the sugar by filling a small coffee cup and comparing it to the 200 grams of chocolate in a second mug, “Now, is this 25% heavier, or only 20%?” Not exactly precise. Somehow, the batter ended up just as silkily smooth, with the slight suggestive resistance of the incorporated eggs in the batter. My second obstacle was to confront my ancient oven. The temperature gauge ranges from 1-5, with no indication of degrees Celsius. Let&#39;s just say that I misjudged. I blame distraction. After airing out the smoke, restraining myself from finishing off the delicious concoction lying underneath the charred crust, I lumbered back to the market to buy more <i>chocolate amargo</i> and <i>mantequilla</i>. With a little more monitoring, the second cake turned out like a charm, and I can’t wait to dive into it in a few days. I love the freezer tip; it definitely makes the cake more devilishly dense and moist. Hopefully my adopted family here will agree. </p>
<p>Wishing you all the best from Mexico,</p>
<p>Lauren </p>
<p>P.S. Your work inspired me to overcome my fear of taking myself &#8220;too seriously,&#8221; as you put it. I started a blog to record my experiences here. Not nearly as delightful as Orangette, but a good outlet nonetheless. A refreshing change from my last major writing project, my thesis.</p>

      <p>I am so thrilled to see this recipe!  It is essentially the same cake that a French friend taught me how to make when I was 11 or 12.  I never bothered to write it down, and when I went away to school and stopped cooking I forgot how to make it, much to my chocoholic father&#39;s deep, deep regret.  Just as easy as I remember, only now I know the proportions!  Thank you, thank you!!</p>

There were two four-year-old girls at dinner, and when dessert was brought to the table, they were asked &#8220;do you want apple, pumpkin, pecan, or chocolate?&#8221;  They both screamed &#8220;Chocolate!&#8221; and scarfed down a hefty slice apiece.  They then proceeded to tear their clothes off and spin in circles, screaming &#8220;I&#39;m Cinderella!  I&#39;m Cinderella!&#8221; before being dragged away by their apologetic parents.  I gotta say&#8230; this is one pretty amazing cake.  Thank you.</p>

      <p>Molly,</p>
<p>My girlfriend propositioned me to make this wonderful cake while she slept on the couch will a cold. However, I made two variations to your recipe.</p>
<p>1. I omitted the TBSP of flour, albeit accidentally ;).</p>
<p>2. I used a water bath to prevent cracking on top and promote even cooking.</p>
<p>The result was a ridiculously creamy texture, like a dense mousse or a silky fudge. </p>
<p>I used cheap chocolate and value butter, but I intend to go all out next go around with the best Whole Foods has to offer.</p>
<p>Thanks for the recipes.</p>
<p>BTW, my girlfriend is loving your book.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I think I died and went to chocolate heaven&#8221;&#8230;this was my response upon spooning  piece into my mouth!!! I baked this cake for my birthday just the other day (the 12th!) and it is just so WICKED good!!! (I&#39;m from NE!) It is sooo good I am going to make another one just to freeze it so that later on when this one is gone I can have more ready and waiting for me!!</p>
<p>On a side note, I baked mine in a springform cake pan as I can not find my round ones (just moved) which of course required no flipping over when done! </p>
<p>Again  thank you so so much for sharing this recipe.  I like how you commented in your book about sharing recipes and not keeping them to yourself. I totally agree!!</p>

      <p>Wowwers&#8230;I just read your book, actually stayed up all night when camping with a head lamp glued to my head drooling over these recipes only to wake up and eat camp fire food:) </p>
<p>Needless to say the moment I arrived home I ran to the store to buy chocolate to make this here cake&#8230;all the while my mouth watering.  My husband nearly cried at 11 pm we sat down for slice then he asked for it for breakfast.   </p>
<p>Mine was not very pretty but I could care less, it was to die for.</p>
<p>I have already called my mother, sister, best friend and sister in law with the details of this recipe.</p>
<p>thanks molly for not keeping it a secret!</p>

      <p>Molly &#8212; Loved your book. I borrowed it from the library and then ran out to buy a copy that I could send to my cousin as a gift. Wanted to let you know that I made these as cupcakes (just a few over a dozen) and I think I underbaked them a little bit which caused them to collapse upon cooling, leaving them very convex on top.  At my husband&#39;s suggestion, I filled the crater with some liquidy caramel and then sprinkled some coarse sel gris on top and then brought them to a potluck, where they managed to vanish instantly to loud acclaim.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to try to make this in a loaf pan next, with salted caramel baked in, since I don&#39;t seem to like to follow directions exactly.</p>

      <p>is it too late to ask a question here? i have an Important Event coming up, where hearts and minds must be won and this is my trusty stand-by. however! some of the hearts and minds in need of winning are gluten-free and i&#39;m wondering if you know what will happen if i leave the flour out.  any thoughts? would it be better to substitute? should i just try it and see what happens? i ask because i thought the question may have been raised before.</p>

      <p>Laura, yes, it&#39;s very easy to do a gluten-free version. Instead of 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, you can use 1 tablespoon cocoa. I&#39;ve made it that way for gluten-free friends, and it works like a charm.</p>

      <p>Candice, I&#39;m afraid of using agave here, because it would add so much liquid.  (You&#39;re talking about agave syrup, right?)  I think it would alter the texture quite a bit, and I&#39;m not sure that it would work.  But if you try it, do let me know!</p>

      <p>hey molly, great recipe. took it out of the cake pan an hour ago, the whole time worrying that it would fall apart as per the comments. i took the liberty of doing a calorie countdown btw.. i&#39;m a freak but here goes<br />carbs &#8211; 314.5 g<br />fat 251.7 g<br />protein 32.6 g</p>
<p>caloies for the whole cake = 3654 calories</p>
<p>if the cake is divided into 8 it is 456.8 calories each<br />if 12, it would be 304.5 calories each</p>
<p>i am going for a run before and after i eat this tomorrow night. but thank you so much for posting this recipe up. me making the cake is hopefully a symbol of a relationshipthat i am trying to repair&#8230; wish me luck.</p>

      <p>A 3,600 calorie cake. No wonder I love it so much. Molly, had to return AHL to the library, and I just made this cake two weeks ago, and I&#39;m in withdrawl, so here I am, finding it online. AND&#8230;I am going to freeze it and bring to Thanksgiving, cause if I bake it here, oh&#8211;! That&#39;s ALL 3,600 kcals for me (which sounds wonderful!)</p>
<p>Oh dear. Just realized that doesn&#39;t count the globs of whipped cream I used on top&#8230;</p>

      <p>Hi again &#8211; just wanted to say that I made this with a 9&#215;1.5&#8243; pan, and they worked great (although I have yet to try it)! A note re. the bubbles &#8211; if you drop the pan onto the counter, it helps get rid of the air bubbles.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on icing/sauce to go with this? Whipped cream seems boring, but maybe the best bet given how rich it is?</p>

      <p>Social Science Girl, glad that 9-inch round pan worked for you!  (The 8-inch should also be fine.  That&#39;s what I use.)  And re: sauce, I would keep it simple.  I use either very lightly sweetened whipped cream or whipped cream with a splash of vanilla and no sugar at all.  Perfect.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly,<br />I know you posted this years ago&#8230;. but I just wanted to say, I used to make something similar years ago, from a Spanish cook book I had years ago as a child. The book was called simply Chocolate. I loved the book, but this was the best and easiest recipe in it!<br />That recipe called for 250 gr each of butter, sugar, and chocolate, 3 eggs, and 3 spoonfuls of flour. It also suggested cooking the cake itself in a double boiler &#8211; insert cake pan into pan of hot water, in the oven and cook for 2 &#038; 3/4 hrs on low. The house always smelled absolutely delicious!</p>

      <p>I made this recipe last night and it turned out more like a brownie because I used a square pan &#8211; but an absolutely delicious, fudgy, gooey, oozy, sinful brownie! </p>
<p>I will definitely try it with a round pan to see if it makes a difference. </p>
<p>I also LOVED how easy it was to throw this cake together. So simple and perfect when you only have a couple hours and limited pantry stocks before people arrive for dinner! </p>

<p> We are having it with brandy whipped cream and rasberry drizzle (raspberries, a touch of lemon and sugar blended then sieved), if this brings on a heart attack it will be well worth it! </p>

      <p>Hi, yet another late visitor to this entry!</p>
<p>I made this last week and it turned out fab. I probably baked it for a bit too long (35 minutes), next time I plan to do it for 5 minutes less and try a lower cocoa-chocolate.</p>
<p>I just wanted to add one tip. After I added the first egg, my mixture separated into a big ball of gloopy, sugary, sticky mess, surrounded by a pool of thin brown water. Possibly the least appetising chocolate substance I&#39;ve ever seen 🙂</p>
<p>Of course, I started freaking about how I couldn&#39;t even mix ingredients properly, but rather than throw it out, I decided to persevere. I added the second egg and stirred it with some serious gusto (arm got tired after very few rotations!) and after that it was fine.</p>
<p>So if you get a weird curdly mess &#8211; just keep going and mix really hard!</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the recipe Molly, it was utterly delicious and went down very well with the birthday bloke 🙂</p>

However, as some other posters have mentioned, my cake came out a little convex- sunken in the middle and very flat overall.  It&#39;s spring in the incredibly humid northeast- maybe the humidity is the cause?  I&#39;ll be making it again in the dry wintertime to see if it makes a difference.  Either way, though, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll love it!</p>

      <p>Hi Molly!  I just finished your book a week or two ago, and I LOVED it!  After dreaming about this cake since I finished the book, I finally made it last night, and it was AMAZING!  I won&#39;t even bat my eye at another chocolate cake ever again, I swear.  I shared some with a friend, and she declared that this cake was her soulmate.  I posted about it today on my blog!  Thanks for all the amazing recipes and the stories!  🙂</p>

      <p>I read your book two days ago and last night I made the cake. I stood in my kitchen with my kindle open to the page with this recipe and tried to avoid getting any batter on it. I made it with milk chocolate and while it was a strange cake/pie consistency, there was also a big clean plate where it had set less than 30 minutes before. <br />I just wanted to thank you for you book. I&#39;ve recently dealt with the illness of my mother and grieving for your father, your family and you helped me made me feel relieved. You perfectly captured the guilt of watching someone suffer and the less glamorous side of dying without asking for pity. I cried with you beginning with the sentence telling us he was ill and didn&#39;t stop until you detailed your marriage.  <br />I found your grad school flip-off a real inspiration as well. I wish I had the &#39;nads to follow food as you did.<br />Anyway, I&#39;ve rambled long enough. Thanks for curing some mid-evening ennui for some Arkansan folks. We enjoyed it!</p>

      <p>Hi Molly,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to leave a comment and tell you that I shamelessly copied you and made these for our wedding cakes (over a year ago now! Yikes.) They turned out beautifully&#8230;probably due to all the &#8220;test runs&#8221; I did. Many, many test runs. Here&#39;s a picture of the cake we cut: </p>

<p>I&#39;m Indo-Canadian and my husband is very white and for some reason these owls made me slightly hysterical whenever I looked at them. <br />Thank you so much for the recipe and your book and your blog.</p>

      <p>What a fabulous cake! Words alone cannot encompass the sheer chocolatey bliss that is blessedly bundled into this squat little package. I knew it would be good from all of the comments, and from the fact that you chose this as your wedding cake &#8230; But geez. If mouths can have orgasms, this is the sweet to facilitate an earth-shattering climax. Since this happy-to-be-single-forever gal will probably never have a wedding to serve this at, I think I&#39;ll just go ahead and marry the cake instead! Til death do us part with this recipe.</p>

      <p>Molly &#8211; Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  (I realize I&#39;m 7 years behind the curve, but I only just finished reading your wonderful book and am in the process of rediscovering my kitchen.)  Long story short:  I brought this cake to my aunt&#39;s for Thanksgiving, and it was a HIT!  I&#39;m definitely adding this to my binder of favorite recipes.  Thank you thank you thank you.

      <p>Molly &#8211; Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  (I realize I&#39;m 7 years behind the curve, but I only just finished reading your wonderful book and am in the process of rediscovering my kitchen.)  Long story short:  I brought this cake to my aunt&#39;s for Thanksgiving, and it was a HIT!  I&#39;m definitely adding this to my binder of favorite recipes.  Thank you thank you thank you.  (And Happy Thanksgiving!)</p>

      <p>Hi, I just wanted to let you know that I made 20 of these cakes for my daughter&#39;s wedding reception.  They froze very well.  In fact, I think that I PREFER to enjoy a small slice while still frozen!  (mmmmmm)  It was a &#8220;cake to remember&#8221;.  Everyone loved it!  Thank you for sharing.</p>
<p>One more benefit, I was able to make several gluten-free versions for my friends on special diets.  I just substituted a tablespoon of cocoa powder for the tablespoon of flour.  </p>
<p>It was a huge hit!!!  Thank you SO much!</p>

      <p>I&#39;m hanging out for the next opportunity to make this cake (once our new kitchen is complete &#8211; I&#39;m cooking on a small unreliable stove in the garage at present). It&#39;s amazing, I fantasize about it. I made one as part of Christmas Day&#39;s many dessert offerings and took the leftovers away on holiday (still amazed that there were leftovers!). To my surprise and delight I discovered that it is also amazing cold from the fridge, like some dense chocolate wonder. Paired with an espresso: heaven!</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve found that adding a touch of vanilla rounds out the chocolate flavor, and a touch of salt with the original recipe does wonders as well.  When using regular butter, I take about 1 oz of it and clarify it, removing a bit of the liquid content ups the overall butterfat to free liquid ratio of store butter.</p>

      <p>Dear Ms. Molly, </p>
<p>Many years ago now a woman from my church made this cake as her contribution to a &#8220;birthday cake potluck&#8221; for our pastor (I did not actually contribute a cake myself, just ate as much as I decently could while dodging sugar-high children flying around the folding tables.)</p>
<p>All of the cakes were tasty, but this one was flooring. I asked for the recipe and was told, &#8220;oh, it is so easy&#8221; and directions to your blog. At the time I was still acclimating to my 36 square foot kitchen and was not sure what &#8220;easy&#8221; meant. German pancake easy or Match Stewart wedding cake easy? In any case, I never looked up the recipe.</p>
<p>Having more or less made peace with my horrible but nonetheless beloved kitchen, I have at many points wanted to make this cake, but could not remember the name of the cake or where to find it. Orange something? Cake what? Hmm.</p>
<p>And then tonight I stumbled on it! The winning hearts and mind cake! That was it! Woo! Hurrah, cake, I found you at last!</p>
<p>I do not know if you are still answering questions on such an old post, but I will throw mine out there. </p>
<p>#1: I know you do not call for it in your recipe, but do you think a water bath would be useful? My oven is the worst oven I have ever used, anywhere&#8211;tiny and narrow, but worse, the most unreliably calibrated oven ever. Ever. The heating element is rusted in spots and my landlord could care less. I have two oven thermometers because the oven fluctuates so wildly without any pattern that I thought my thermometer must be broken, but no, the oven just sucks. I bake all the time and usually just cope, but have had bad luck with water-bath-less bread puddings on a few occasions when the oven temp jumped randomly halfway through baking. This recipe looks very custardy.</p>
<p>2. Could you do this in four little 4&#8243; cakes? I thought then I could freeze three and then eat them a bit more slowly, if it only keeps a few days. (I do that with a lot of things anyway&#8211;the freezer is my substitute for willpower.) </p>
<p>Thank you for your recipe&#8211;I enjoyed it so much at the potluck (as did everyone else, to my selfish dismay.) I hope to enjoy it again soon!</p>
<p>Sarah</p>

      <p>Dear Ms. Molly, </p>
<p>Many years ago now a woman from my church made this cake as her contribution to a &#8220;birthday cake potluck&#8221; for our pastor (I did not actually contribute a cake myself, just ate as much as I decently could while dodging sugar-high children flying around the folding tables.)</p>
<p>All of the cakes were tasty, but this one was flooring. I asked for the recipe and was told, &#8220;oh, it is so easy&#8221; and directions to your blog. At the time I was still acclimating to my 36 square foot kitchen and was not sure what &#8220;easy&#8221; meant. German pancake easy or Match Stewart wedding cake easy? In any case, I never looked up the recipe.</p>
<p>Having more or less made peace with my horrible but nonetheless beloved kitchen, I have at many points wanted to make this cake, but could not remember the name of the cake or where to find it. Orange something? Cake what? Hmm.</p>
<p>And then tonight I stumbled on it! The winning hearts and mind cake! That was it! Woo! Hurrah, cake, I found you at last!</p>
<p>I do not know if you are still answering questions on such an old post, but I will throw mine out there. </p>
<p>#1: I know you do not call for it in your recipe, but do you think a water bath would be useful? My oven is the worst oven I have ever used, anywhere&#8211;tiny and narrow, but worse, the most unreliably calibrated oven ever. Ever. The heating element is rusted in spots and my landlord could care less. I have two oven thermometers because the oven fluctuates so wildly without any pattern that I thought my thermometer must be broken, but no, the oven just sucks. I bake all the time and usually just cope, but have had bad luck with water-bath-less bread puddings on a few occasions when the oven temp jumped randomly halfway through baking. This recipe looks very custardy.</p>
<p>2. Could you do this in four little 4&#8243; cakes? I thought then I could freeze three and then eat them a bit more slowly, if it only keeps a few days. (I do that with a lot of things anyway&#8211;the freezer is my substitute for willpower.) </p>
<p>Thank you for your recipe&#8211;I enjoyed it so much at the potluck (as did everyone else, to my selfish dismay.) I hope to enjoy it again soon!</p>
<p>Sarah</p>

      <p>Hi Sarah &#8211;</p>
<p>To answer #1, I&#39;ve never tried baking this in a water bath, and my hunch is that it would change the texture somewhat.  But I can&#39;t imagine that it would be <i>bad</i>!  If I were you, with such a truly wonky oven, I would try it.  I imagine that the baking time might be a little longer?</p>
<p>And re: #2, you can absolutely play around with making this in smaller pans.  You&#39;ll want to really keep an eye on them as they bake, of course, because they&#39;ll take less time than a single big cake, but you can definitely do it.  And this cake is one that improves quite dramatically somehow with freezing: the texture gets smoother, and to my taste, the flavor also deepens.  I often recommend that people make it ahead of time, freeze it, and defrost it before serving.  So your little cakes fit will within that strategy!</p>
<p>Best wishes.</p>

      <p>Dear Molly,</p>
<p>Thank you for replying to my questions so kindly and helpfully. I think I will bake it in a water bath, if you think that will be okay, and definitely as little cakes. It makes me happy that they freeze well. I love things that freeze well. </p>
<p>When I make them (which will be as soon as my husband and I can get through three dozen cookies) I will let you know how they turn out. </p>
<p>Your blog is just lovely&#8211;I cannot believe I did not see it before now. I have put your book on hold at the library and look forward to reading it.</p>
<p>Again, thank you so much for your help! </p>
<p>Sarah</p>
<p>p.s. wait, who&#39;s Match Stewart? Hmm.</p>

      <p>MMolly,<br />I read your book a few months before getting married last year and decided to make this cake as my wedding cake, along with an earl grey flavored cake. I was absolutely in love with the idea of using cupcakes and so I made about 12 dozen of both kinds of cupcakes.<br />The cupcakes turned out very well. They sank quite a bit in the middle, but that was just fine, as I topped them all with some lightly sweetened, whipped cream cheese frosting (I couldn&#39;t use whipped cream, as it wouldn&#39;t stand up to the summer heat). Everyone who tried them loved them.<br />I made the cupcakes again recently, and discovered that leaving them frozen is quite nice, especially in the middle of summer. I just put them all in a ziploc bag and took one out when I wanted one. Very hard to get out of a wrapper, though. I just got some silicone baking cups and plan on using them next time.</p>
<p>Oh, I noticed the recipes on your blog and in your book are slightly different. Any particular reason?</p>

      <p>I know this comment is on a 8! year old post, but I just wanted to tell you that I made this amazing cake for the first time for my boyfriend&#39;s mom&#39;s wedding this weekend.  It is the most insanely delicious chocolate anything. Everyone was asking for the recipe over and over.</p>
<p>I loved your idea of transporting the cakes in pizza boxes, so I did the same (we travelled 8 hours, and both cakes arrived without as much as a crumb out of place!).  They pizza place thought I was a little nuts, but oh, well. </p>
<p>Thanks again for the amazing recipe, and have a great time with your new joy, June!  Looking forward to getting up to Delancey and seeing Essex soon.  </p>

This past weekend though I decided to experiment with the recipe (not that it needs improving whatsoever) and I was delighted with the results.

The cayenne gave a nice pop of flavor. </p>

      <p>Can you translate this into American measurements for those of us who don&#39;t typically deal with ounces? Say cups instead of ounces? I&#39;m guessing this is a heaping cup of chocolate bits and 1 3/4 sticks of butter? </p>

      <p>Ellen, I don&#39;t measure chocolate by cups because everyone chops their chocolate to different sizes, so there&#39;s no way to accurately measure by cups.  That said, it&#39;s usually pretty easy to deal with chocolate by weight, even if you don&#39;t have a scale, because the package it comes in usually has a weight written on it.  The same goes for butter.  But yes, 7 ounces of butter is 1 and 3/4 sticks, or 14 tablespoons!</p>

      <p>Hi, finished A Homemade Life yesterday and loved it. Already made your pesto and your ratatouille&#8230;both wonderful. Today I made your Winning Hearts and Minds cake. I had to tweak a little based on what was in my cupboard (regular unsalted butter, organic sugar, ghiradelli bittersweet chips, organic jumbo eggs&#8230;.)&#8230;however, it&#39;s divine. I expect to wrap and freeze it according to the book directions and have it thaw on the drive to Boston and be ready to consume that night or for the next day&#39;s lunch. Thank you so much for your book and blog&#8230;..you&#39;re terrific.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly,</p>
<p>This is my first time commenting on your blog. I read your book (within 2 sittings), which was fantastic!!!! It lead me to this blog, and I have to tell you &#8211; Thank you! For this blog, for this book &#8211; you are a wonderful writer, a true story teller and I think we have all fallen in love with you and your family!</p>
<p>I made this cake yesterday for the first time for my husband&#39;s birthday. It turned out amazing! The crust, on the side and on top was perfect, crackly and gave a nice bite. Once I cut in, the center however, was still soft, jiggly, and somewhat fell apart when cutting slices. </p>
<p>I just wonder is that how it&#39;s supposed to be? Mousse like, or chocolate lava cake like consistency? If so, it turned out perfect! I was just worried that I hadn&#39;t cooked it fully, and I was serving my guests raw eggs! </p>
<p>Either way, it was delicious. One of the best cakes I&#39;ve had ever! Thank you! </p>

      <p>10 years later and this cake is still winning hearts and minds! I stumbled across this recipe tonight and couldn&#39;t have been happier with the results. So delicious, so moist, so forgiving (used Plugra with Nestle semisweet chocolate chips, shhh)! This is my new go-to recipe, thank you! </p>

      <p>Dear Molly~ I went shopping for the best chocolate I could find and came home with Scharffen Berger Fine Artisan Dark Chocolate~but I was only able to find Unsweetened 99%  and Semisweet 62%~<br />Which one should I use?<br />P.S. I belong to a Dream Group~we get together once a week and someone brings a dream to work on~I&#39;m the dreamer this week, and the dream I&#39;m bringing was all about cake~In the dream I was baking a heart shaped cake using a square pan and a circular pan; turning the square into a diamond position,  cutting the round in half  and<br />perching the two halves on the topsides of the diamond. (Paul Klee, in his treatise on the heart shape, calls it the perfect marriage of the square and the <br />circle)~ So I want to bring the most wonderful chocolate cake possible to accompany my dream, and yours <br />clearly seems to be it !!! Dream Group meets tomorrow, so I hope I&#39;ll get lucky and hear from you soon !!!</p>

      <p>Rose, I love the sound of your Dream Group!  Wow. And as for the chocolate, I would use the 62%, and then cut back a little bit on the sugar in the cake.  Good luck!</p>

      <p>Hi Molly, a quick question about baking options&#8230; could you make cupcake size cakes with this? Or too small? I want to find a way to make a half batch, but my only small pan is ceramic, which I imagine would be problematic? Thanks so much for any advice. I can&#39;t wait to try this!</p>

      <p>Anonymous, I&#39;m sorry for not replying sooner!  If it&#39;s not too late, well, let&#39;s see: I do think you could make cupcake-sized versions of this, yes.  You&#39;d just need to really keep an eye on the oven, because I think they&#39;ll bake much more quickly.  As for ceramic baking pans, I have no idea!  I have a friend who swears by baking brownies in a ceramic pan, though, so I have to guess that it would work just fine for this cake, since it&#39;s quite brownie-like.  Good luck!</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been making this cake for several years&#8211;since reading your book. Love them both! Recently I&#39;ve been wanting a small sweet to sell in our (wine) tasting room kitchen where we have sandwiches and salads on the weekends.  The requirements are that it be something I can freeze and defrost AND that it be good with a dry red wine.  I tried cheesecake a couple years ago (big thumbs down from the winemaker hubby) and played with ginger cookies, but they just didn&#39;t go. So I&#39;d been wanting to try this in mini form.  Last night I tried the recipe (with cocoa powder because of passover and Jewish friends visiting).  I baked in cupcake tins (with little parchment rounds&#8211;the most labor intensive part).  It made 18.  I need to tweak, but I think if you use a 1/4 cup measure it would be ideal. I baked for 15 minutes in my convection oven at 360 and they were perfect. Any ideas for decorating? Thought I would package in little plastic treat bags&#8230;</p>

      <p>do you think it would be too much to top this cake with a teeny bit of chocolate ganache? I&#39;d love to try this as a birthday cake for my mother-in-law this weekend but want to dress it up a bit somehow. </p>

      <p>Hi Molly, <br />I commented on this post last year. Just a few scrolls up. <br />I love love love this cake. <br />Like I mentioned, the side and the top are nice and crackly, but the center, looks and feels uncooked. Very jiggly and falls apart once I cut it. <br />Any suggestions? I wonder if I&#39;m just cutting it too soon?<br />Thank you, <br />Divya</p>

      <p>Hi Divya!  My apologies for not getting back to you earlier.  My instinct is to say that you&#39;re probably underbaking the cake.  Does the center jiggle when you take it out of the oven?  If so, I would leave it to bake for a few minutes, so that it no longer jiggles, or just *barely*.  If you feel pretty certain that you&#39;re cooking it long enough, then I do think the problem has to do with not letting it cool long enough.  I made five of these cakes for an event last week, and I made them the day before I planned to serve them, so that they could fully cool and set up.  I think that&#39;s the best plan!  They sliced beautifully.</p>

      <p>Dear Molly or anyone out there- have you used espresso powder in this recipe and if so how much?  I am not trying to make it mocha- only I have heard that adding a bit of espresso powder adds another layer to the flavor. And yes I would use the Plugra and Panther bar  chocolate (85%) by endangered species ( and no I have no affiliation with that company other than loving the chocolate).  OR Molly what chocolate is your favorite with it? Also what about vanilla- would a little fresh vanilla bean also be good in this? Would that Espresso make it too dark with such dark chocolate?   I cannot wait to make this cake!</p>

      <p>Oh my goodness! I have been waiting for just the right opportunity to make this for my gluten intolerant boyfriend, and his birthday was this week, so I seized the chance.</p>
<p>I swapped out the flour for some Scharffen Berger cocoa powder to make it gluten free, as you suggested in the comments, and used Plugra and Theo dark chocolate bars. I was so focused on the inverting and reverting step that I accidentally forgot to let it cool for ten minutes first, and it sort of fell apart &#8211; oops! I pushed it back together and decided to soldier on with a Julia Child &#8220;Never apologize!&#8221; kind of attitude, though it didn&#39;t look very pretty.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly!</p>
<p>Thanks to this post, I&#39;ve been making your &#8220;winning hearts and minds cake&#8221; for years and it never fails me!  We love it so much around here that I&#39;m planning to make a whole bunch of them for my wedding.  So here&#39;s my question- I&#39;m sure that it freezes well- but haven&#39;t tried that because it never sticks around long enough to make it to the freezer.  Have you frozen this cake before?  I was thinking that if I made a bunch and then froze them, then I wouldn&#39;t have to be baking the day before the wedding.  Do you think that&#39;s a crazy idea?</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been making this cake for several years&#8211;since reading your book. Love them both! Recently I&#39;ve been wanting a small sweet to sell in our (wine) tasting room kitchen where we have sandwiches and salads on the weekends. The requirements are that it be something I can freeze and defrost AND that it be good with a dry red wine. I tried cheesecake a couple years ago (big thumbs down from the winemaker hubby) and played with ginger cookies, but they just didn&#39;t go. So I&#39;d been wanting to try this in mini form. Last night I tried the recipe (with cocoa powder because of passover and Jewish friends visiting). I baked in cupcake tins (with little parchment rounds&#8211;the most labor intensive part). It made 18. I need to tweak, but I think if you use a 1/4 cup measure it would be ideal. I baked for 15 minutes in my convection oven at 360 and they were perfect. Any ideas for decorating? Thought I would package in little plastic treat bags.</p>

      <p>I really don&#8217;t know, Sarah.  Butter is a big part of this cake, and because I don&#8217;t have a ton of experience baking with coconut oil, I don&#8217;t feel comfortable advising it &#8211; or, for that matter, advising against it.  If you try it, will you let me know how it turns out?</p>

      <p>Hi Molly&#8211;thank you so much for your response, I really appreciate it. I&#8217;m nervous to try it also, but would imagine that fat is fat, and that it might work. I will certainly let you know if I do try it. I found some other dairy-free desserts in the meanwhile I might make instead (this is for a dinner party, so I&#8217;m loath to experiment when it&#8217;s game time). I&#8217;ll share them here in case you&#8217;re ever in this quandary as well and don&#8217;t make your very own Marmalade cake:</p>

      <p>This recipe rocks!  I made it for the first time last night, having never tasted it before even &#8212; just solely going by the reviews and feedback here.  My company had a Salty &amp; Sweet bake-off today, and this cake was my contribution.</p>
<p>It not only won best in the Sweet category, but it won &#8220;Best of Show&#8221; overall.</p>
<p>Thank you, Molly!  Did you ever dream that you and your cake would still be winning hearts and minds here 12 years later??  😀</p>

      <p>We read your book for bookclub this month.  It was at my house, so I decided to make about 6 of the recipes.  I made this cake because it was your wedding cake so it has to be good &#8211; right?  Anyway, my oven is temperamental to say the least, so when I took it out of the oven, I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was done, even after a couple extra rounds of 2 minutes. It kinda collapsed on itself and I wasn&#8217;t sure if the middle was done.  Then I realized my oven dipped to 325 &#8211; so who knows what temp this thing was baking at.  Anyway, I put it in the fridge and I was going to remake it &#8211; it looked that scary.  Then I decided forget it &#8211; if it&#8217;s bad, it&#8217;s bad.  I threw some whip cream and chocolate sprinkles on it &#8211; and served it up. DELICIOUS- people are still talking about this cake.  So for anyone out there who pulls this out of the oven and thinks they&#8217;ve royally messed up &#8211; you didn&#8217;t &#8211; this recipe is very forgiving &#8211; and whip cream like a good concealer can mask anything.  I will definitely be making this again!</p>

      <p>This isn&#8217;t a cake I would stack, actually.  It&#8217;s very dense and moist, like a fudgy brownie, and it would be really really really too rich as a multi-layer thing.</p>

      <p>Tali, I apologize for this delayed reply! I would say that this dessert is not a beautiful one, actually, and you&#8217;ve probably done it exactly right! It falls as it cools, and the sides do end up looking wrinkled. I love it that way, but it&#8217;s definitely a homey look.</p>

      <p>Tali &#8211; one thing I have found works well is to put a shape in the middle of it &#8212; a heart, a star, whatever, and then dust powdered sugar through a sifter all around.  It creates a beautiful effect that looks very professionally done.  Just be careful when you&#8217;re removing the shape not to spill any and mess your shape up.  😉</p>

      <p>Merry Christmas, Molly! I&#8217;m baking this cake, again(!), for my contribution to Christmas dinner. I have made it many times over the years and it continues to be my very favorite chocolate cake ever!! Doesn&#8217;t hurt that it&#8217;s so easy. I melt the chocolate and butter right on a very low flame until almost melted, take off the heat, then stir til it&#8217;s liquid. Then sugar, eggs, flour, pour in pan and into the oven! Gotta love a one-pot cake. 🙂 Have a wonderful Christmas and 2017. Wishing you all good things.</p>

I can also make a gluten free version really easily with almost any gluten free substitute without any problems except coconut flour which I just don&#8217;t personally like (very helpful as my sister in law is a celiac and often gets left out of dessert at group events because everyone forgets she&#8217;s allergic!)<br />
There&#8217;s been a few people saying that it went gloopy or liquid in the centre. I&#8217;ve only had this happen once but it was definitely because I upturned it while it was still to hot. In my experience this cake needs to cool and set much like a baked cheesecake does.</p>

      <p>Thank you for this cake! I have gluten free and dairy free friends so I have subbed coconut oil-just slightly less than one to one- and used Bob’s One to One gluten free flour. It is amazing! My 9 year old daughter feels so grown up because she can make this cake by herself!</p>

      <p>love this cake and have made it heaps of times and shared the recipe with so many people&#8230; But have to say &#8211; there is no need to flip or flop or invert this cake!!! I cut the baking paper leaving the corners in long strips to go up the side of the pan. You can use these to lift the cake from the tin, or if you have a springform, to slide the cake sideways into the cooling rack. Once it&#8217;s cool (and a little more solid) you fold and peel the baking paper off the bottom of the cake as you slide it into a plate 🙂</p>

      <p>I love this cake and make it frequently.  I even gave the recipe to my husband, who has very limited cooking talents, to make for the annual baking contest at his work.  It always wins!  Recently, I substituted gluten-free flour for the flour.  It worked perfectly and my gluten-free friend nearly burst out crying as no one has ever made her a gluten-free cake before!</p>

      <p>I know this is a long way from the original post, but I’m hoping someone can help. I absolutely love this cake, and make it several times a year, but the same thing always happens &#8211; it rises way up around the edges, but not in the middle, creating a sort of bowl-shaped cake. Generally not too much of a problem since I put whipped cream on top, but I’d like to know what I’m doing wrong. I do use only about 1/2 of the sugar.  I recently bought those strips you wet and put around the outside of the cake pan while it’s cooking. It seems to have exacerbated the problem.</p>

      <p>I am seeing this almost a year later but I just popped in here as I&#8217;m making the cake for Valentine&#8217;s Day. I have made this cake a number of times over the years and at some point I made a notation to bake it at 325 instead of 375. I have no idea if that would help with your issue or not. But figured it was worth saying!</p>
