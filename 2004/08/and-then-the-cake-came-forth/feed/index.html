I am seeing this almost a year later but I just popped in here as I&#039;m making the cake for Valentine&#039;s Day. I have made this cake a number of times over the years and at some point I made a notation to bake it at 325 instead of 375. I have no idea if that would help with your issue or not. But figured it was worth saying!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know this is a long way from the original post, but I‚Äôm hoping someone can help. I absolutely love this cake, and make it several times a year, but the same thing always happens - it rises way up around the edges, but not in the middle, creating a sort of bowl-shaped cake. Generally not too much of a problem since I put whipped cream on top, but I‚Äôd like to know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I do use only about 1/2 of the sugar.  I recently bought those strips you wet and put around the outside of the cake pan while it‚Äôs cooking. It seems to have exacerbated the problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love this cake and make it frequently.  I even gave the recipe to my husband, who has very limited cooking talents, to make for the annual baking contest at his work.  It always wins!  Recently, I substituted gluten-free flour for the flour.  It worked perfectly and my gluten-free friend nearly burst out crying as no one has ever made her a gluten-free cake before!]]></description>

Tali - one thing I have found works well is to put a shape in the middle of it -- a heart, a star, whatever, and then dust powdered sugar through a sifter all around.  It creates a beautiful effect that looks very professionally done.  Just be careful when you&#039;re removing the shape not to spill any and mess your shape up.  ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[love this cake and have made it heaps of times and shared the recipe with so many people... But have to say - there is no need to flip or flop or invert this cake!!! I cut the baking paper leaving the corners in long strips to go up the side of the pan. You can use these to lift the cake from the tin, or if you have a springform, to slide the cake sideways into the cooling rack. Once it&#039;s cool (and a little more solid) you fold and peel the baking paper off the bottom of the cake as you slide it into a plate :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this cake! I have gluten free and dairy free friends so I have subbed coconut oil-just slightly less than one to one- and used Bob‚Äôs One to One gluten free flour. It is amazing! My 9 year old daughter feels so grown up because she can make this cake by herself!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, a work mate gave me this recipe about a year ago and it&#039;s the only cake I make now! It&#039;s so easy when you&#039;re in a hurry and everyone loves it. I can also make a gluten free version really easily with almost any gluten free substitute without any problems except coconut flour which I just don&#039;t personally like (very helpful as my sister in law is a celiac and often gets left out of dessert at group events because everyone forgets she&#039;s allergic!)
There&#039;s been a few people saying that it went gloopy or liquid in the centre. I&#039;ve only had this happen once but it was definitely because I upturned it while it was still to hot. In my experience this cake needs to cool and set much like a baked cheesecake does.]]></description>
