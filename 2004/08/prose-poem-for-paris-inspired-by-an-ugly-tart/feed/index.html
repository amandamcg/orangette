					<description><![CDATA[Do people comment to a post 9 years later?  Yep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This post made me smile.  What single gal hasn&#039;t been there.  The title is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I saw that your food blog was ranked in the top 10 but I really didn&#039;t understand why.  It seemed to be more about your baby than anything else.  Don&#039;t get me wrong, I LOVE babies!  And yours is a beauty!  Truly.  I just wasn&#039;t expecting so much of it in a food blog that ranked so high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until this post.  I can now see that it was a build up from single life with a 9 year evolution to married life with child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to dig for the reasons.  My curious nature, I suppose.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to respond or post this comment.  Just had to say that your early writings are wonderful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely amazing poem, Molly - so fluid and casual and sad/happy simultaneously. Reminds me of a romantic and less cynical Billy Collins :) So glad I went back in your archives and found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you wrote more poetry to share with us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Stacy]]></description>
