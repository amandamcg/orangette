					<description><![CDATA[If anyone ever comes back here looking for the torta di ricotta recipe, I did come across a mention of one in the April 2004 issue of Gourmet Magazine (page 130) after reading Molly&#039;s comment to Jay. I don&#039;t have a copy of this issue myself, but maybe someone else has it stashed away and would be willing to share the recipe with us?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just discovered you and your lovely blog so I&#039;m reading it from the beginning because I love food and cooking (but would never call myself a &quot;foodie&quot;).  Anyway, as I read this post, I forgot your name for a second (I&#039;m new) so I read the passage as &quot;holy, holy, how inappropriate, moly&quot;  and I giggled and thought, that&#039;s clever but she spelled moly wrong, and then I realized your name is Molly...ohhh. got it. still clever though.  and still giggling.&lt;br /&gt;Gillian]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good question, Jay.  I&#039;m not sure why I didn&#039;t post the recipe here five years ago!  Weird.  To tell you the truth, I&#039;m now not sure of where I got it - maybe &lt;i&gt;Gourmet&lt;/i&gt;? - and it doesn&#039;t seem to be in my folder of recipe clippings anymore.  If you have old issues of Gourmet, you might flip through them and look for a torta di ricotta.  It probably would have been published in 2004.]]></description>
