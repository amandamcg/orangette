					<description><![CDATA[Just have to let you know that I discovered this recipe in your book, and have been in love with it ever since.  We make them frequently, most often with frozen berries, and they are quite decadent.  &lt;br /&gt;I am in the midst of making several batches for an upcoming work meeting, and will be trying some of the new flavor combos I discovered in these comments here.  &lt;br /&gt;This has been a fail-proof recipe for me, and I can&#039;t thank you enough for sharing it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, &lt;br /&gt;I just finished reading your book and loved every minute of it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I knew I had to try these first and they were fantastic! I had prepared myself for a mess since I didn&#039;t heed your advice &amp; used some strawberries from the freezer on my first attempt but it was a manageable mess, lol! I used a silicone mat to knead and pat out the dough which I think helped. I was counting out my &quot;kneads&quot; and twelve was perfect! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &quot;winning hearts and minds cake&quot; will be next for my chocolate addicted boyfriend. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for sharing your thoughts and recipes with all of us, I appreciate you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just made these scones with frozen peach slices, as my frozen strawberries were a terrible solid mass of melty-ness.  They are good but strangely remind me of a baked pancake.  I&#039;m partial to the ginger scone recipe from A Homemade Life.  I made those several times and only got 1 as my proud husband passed them out to all of our friends.  Love the idea of frozen fruit, but I&#039;ll stick to dry ingredients... not sure if it&#039;s worth the sticky mess.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made these last night to have for quick breakfasts and they turned out wonderfully! All I added were chocolate ships. I weigh my flour instead of measuring, as I&#039;ve found that organic all purpose tends to pack heavily. Also duck eggs have been available locally recently so I used one of those. Anyway, LOVE the recipe and can&#039;t wait to try some other flavor additions. Thank you for posting this!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read your book until the wee hours of this morning. Your writing has such grace, humor, and authenticity. I grew up in a cooking and eating family. My mother has a substantial vegetable garden, which has nurtured my love for all things green. I am now a novice cook, and cannot wait to make these scones! I am so tempted to go with strawberries on the first round... Thank you for your delicious words and food.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read A Homemade Life over the weekend and had to try the scone recipe right away.  (I&#039;ve also recommended the book to about 12 friends.)  I subbed whole wheat pastry flour for all the white flour and used orange zest, nutmeg and dried blueberries instead of lemon zest and ginger.  They were heavenly, and I can&#039;t wait to try some of the other variations here!  Thanks, Molly!]]></description>
