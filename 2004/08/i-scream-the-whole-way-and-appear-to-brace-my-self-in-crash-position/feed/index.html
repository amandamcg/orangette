					<description><![CDATA[I just HAD to post another comment.  I have been pouring over your recipes and reading your blog all evening.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a transplanted East coast girl, by way of Miami and NY, having lived on the West coast since the 70&#039;s.  Your take on the world is wonderfully diverse, and I can&#039;t tell you how much I appreciate your food aesthetic AND your sense of humor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I live in Newcastle, right across the lake, and will be seeing David Byrne at the Paramount on the 24th.  This will be my 13th time since the advent of the Heads.  I sometimes feel like a mid-century groupie.  *sigh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am writing to applaud you for your very tempting recipes and appreciation for the always quirky genius that is David Byrne.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just started reading your blog and find it immensely satisfying that you posted a recipe that states that it &quot;serves one&quot;.  I love cooking, but cooking as a single person often involves eating leftovers for three days.  It&#039;s nice to see something I can eat only once without being wasteful.  I can&#039;t wait to keep reading.  Thanks.]]></description>
