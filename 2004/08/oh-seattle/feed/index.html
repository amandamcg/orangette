					<description><![CDATA[last time I was in Seattle, I went out with girlfriends and sis-n-laws to a friends&#039; bar on the ave...all was well until a brutal fight broke out right in front of the bar. Two guys took off and the one left behind was rendered nearly unconscious by the enormous knot on his head. Girlfriend came and dragged him off despite the fact he clearly needed medical attention. The whole thing was very disturbing, mainly that they would eschew getting med. attention b/c of fear of being asked questions by authorities. I don&#039;t remember it being that bad when I lived there a decade ago.&lt;br /&gt;-steph]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes.  We are listening.  The sadness of the Ave is not constrained to the buildings, streets and cafes you frequent.  It is the human beings that have little choice but to rely on the Ave for their survival.  Many of them are trying to get off drugs and get healthy and that’s why there is a comprehensive network of services in the U District.  These “strung-out street kids” rely on one another for their safety.  In fact, that’s why many of them have dogs – many of these kids feed and treat their dogs better than they feed themselves.  When you look at it that way, it’s hard to feel contempt for them.  While I recognize your frustration over the conditions they undoubtedly live in, I caution you to reconsider how you view these youth.  They are not on the Ave to disturb you – they are there exercising the few options they have to survive out on those streets.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#039;tis true, the Ave has been in a nose-dive for the past 10-15 years. Some blame it on the astronomical rents, others on University Village (renovated in part due to high commercial rent on the Ave). Or perhaps it&#039;s all part of a plan by the UW regents to become more like Yale. All the same, I agree - the U-district is in need of serious help.]]></description>
