					<description><![CDATA[Wondering if anyone has tried to make this cake GF. Interested in hearing about any slight changes in the recipe to accommodate those of us unable to handle gluten. Many thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This cake has become a favorite.  I like that I can make many variations .  The variation using ground almonds is a particular favorite.  Last night I really switched things up.  I used the ground almonds, orange zest, melted butter instead of oil (from Laura Calder) and brown sugar instead of granulated sugar.  I made an orange syrup to pour over the cake.  It&#039;s delicious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This cake is so insanely delicious, I barely got it cool before I cut it and ate a quarter of the cake! I only reduced the sugar a little and put some walnuts in. I had never made this cake before, but now it is my favorite. The lemon zest and yogurt go so great together, what a delight. Box mix tastes dead compared to this. Thank you for this recipe!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly
I came to your site for a regular check up and to retrieve this recipe. Hi! And also, this recipe isn&#039;t appearing in your new recipe index. Various combinations of &#039;French&#039;, &#039;yoghurt&#039; and &#039;cake&#039; failed to produce it. Eventually I did find it using Google&#039;s search engine rather than your own... I would hate for other readers to experience the deep distress I went through when I thought this recipe was gone, so I wanted to let you know. (It just occurred to me that it could be my Australian spelling of &#039;yoghurt&#039; that caused the problem, but a search function should know better). 

Thank you for this recipe. I&#039;ve collected 6 La Fermiere jars specifically so that I can make it. As only one is needed for cooking, I drink whisky out of the rest of them. Ergo, this cake has brought joy into my life in so many different ways, not the least of which is La Fermiere vanilla yoghurt. xox]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi from the UK.

I know this recipe is over 10 years old but jus wanted to leave a comment to say, I made this cake for the first time ever last week and it looked amazing (like I had bought it in a shop, one friend commented). Have made it again today and it has turned out equally amazingly!  It&#039;s going in my book of best recipes ever. Thank you so much for sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for my go-to cake recipe - I&#039;ve made this dozens of times across 5 countries since I found your blog in 2009. I finally found a la fermiere yoghurt pot in a second-hand shop a few weeks ago (having lost all of my others in house moves) so am happily making this cake again - this time with raspberries and blue berries, poppyseeds and brandy. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this recipe.  I made it with two thirds almond meal and the rest flour.  It had a chewiness, and I think I would prefer more tenderness, no almond meal next time.

I also reduced the sugar by a quarter and it was sweet enough for us.

I think the amount of oil can also be cut down by a quarter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey you beautiful human!
I have just baked this deliciousness and feel so sad that I have lived to the age of almost 30, unhappily unaware of such a delightful thing. 
I used the exact recipe but added some vanilla extract just because I can.  It is still an amazing recipe sans vanilla extract. Hail to the French people, hail to Orangette! 
I&#039;d better get back to devouring that cake.
