					<description><![CDATA[Larb or Larp is one of my favorite things ever.  I even made it for part of my wedding meal.  I love your book and for some reason am just now visiting your blog.  Silly me for waiting so long.  Enjoy your new babe.  Mine is 3 1/2 and it really does go so fast.  Fast enough that I don&#039;t get my age correct either...Thank you Molly!]]></description>
