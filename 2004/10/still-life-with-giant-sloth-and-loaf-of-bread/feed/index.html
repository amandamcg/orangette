					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your post was like a breath of fresh air! I know exactly how you feel and cannot wait for the day when scenery such as that you described will become part of a regular day :-) I must admit I feel so inadequate that I do not cook as much as I should. Then again, when you spend a total of 3 waking hours at home (most nights it is 2), it is not easy.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I have to be at work today? Want to just escape...Perhaps I should book myself in for a holiday soon :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not entirely sure we *can* compare, my dear Amy, but I&#039;m damn well going to try.  I may not be grinding my own flour anytime soon, but I&#039;ve got my eye on a Bosch Universal (Bread-)Mixer and am determined to learn that bread like the back of my pale pinky-white hand.  Grrrrr!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not even sure what red winter wheat is but I suddenly feel inadequate for not regularly grinding it. Do people really exist who both do that and have books on the ice age lying about? How can the rest of us compare?]]></description>
