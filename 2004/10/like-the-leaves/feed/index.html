					<description><![CDATA[You two are so sweet, and your comments mean a lot to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel very lucky to have such wonderful memories of my dad, even if we did have our ugly moments, a moratorium on talking politics (grrrr), and those sorts of things!  He is still very present for me, and I love talking about him and writing about him...for me, they are ways of celebrating him.  He was a very vibrant, fun-loving, engaging man, and I feel like I honor him best when I&#039;m enjoying myself, being bold, and getting on with getting on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Mark, as for the sourdough starter, Margot tells me that it&#039;s actually pretty easy to get going.  [I just have the extra ease of stealing some of hers!]  To make sourdough starter, dissolve in a 1-quart jar (your &quot;starter pot&quot;) one packet of yeast, 1 Tbs sugar, and 2 cups warm water.  Add 2 cups flour, then mix well and let stand, uncovered, for 24-48 hours in a warm spot.  Cover and refrigerate indefinitely, stirring now and then when it separates.  If it starts looking tired, or if you need to make more, simply add equal parts flour and water and let sit out overnight.  Now, if you live in a farmhouse or a bakery with lots of wild yeast in the air, you could go without the packet of yeast, but it&#039;s unlikely to work in normal city conditions...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What can I say, Molly? Your father sounds like one of the good ones. I&#039;m sorry you didn&#039;t get to bake bread with him but I&#039;m glad you were able to share that summer of pesto and white corn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your starter and keep on walking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was truly saddened to read about your father. It is something I have never had to deal with (yet) and it makes one wonder at the purpose of life. However, I have always thought that (as with anything) quality is better than quantity, and I imagine your father&#039;s relatively short life was fulfiling because he knew that he had brought a talented, creative, and kind person into the world. I bet he&#039;s proud of you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the phrase &quot;the solution comes through walking&quot;. I had always wondered what motto I would have on a coat of arms, and I now think that it would be &lt;&gt;Solvitur ambulando&lt;&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was at university in Brighton, and for the first year in Aberdeen, I used to walk 3 miles to work and back. They were the best parts of the day. Though I love walking with friends, there is nothing like the sweet solitude of walking through a city on one&#039;s own, watching, thinking, dreaming even. I miss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sourdough chocolate cake sounds lovely, though I can&#039;t help thinking that it will be difficult to find the starter in a country which sees bagels as being a bit exotic! Wish me luck!]]></description>
