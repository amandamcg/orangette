					<description><![CDATA[Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just stumbled upon this post (regular, more recent, reader) and felt compelled to inform you that when I was a high school exchange student in Belgium in 2009, we also danced to &quot;Tomber la Chemise&quot; in tight, smokey bars.  So maybe your taste was a little more timeless than originally thought?  Or maybe ours was just particularly bad...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, love the site, the stories, and the food,&lt;br /&gt;Maria]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Elizabeth, it&#039;s been so long since you left your comment that I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;ll see this, but if so, here&#039;s the lowdown. (And apologies for my lateness!  December was a mess.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This picture was taken with an old point-and-shoot film camera that I had at the time.  This was before I got my first digital camera in December of 2004 - and before I then ditched digital and went &lt;i&gt;back&lt;/i&gt; to shooting film in April of 2008.  From late 2004 to summer of 2006, I shot with a Sony Cybershot point-and-shoot digital, and then I got a fancier digital camera, a Nikon D70s. But after a while, I felt frustrated with digital.  It tends to flatten things, and it just doesn&#039;t work with light the way film does.  So, in 2008, I started using film again. For the blog, I use mostly old Polaroid cameras and instant film.  I also use an old Nikon FE (35mm) and a Hasselblad 500c/m, both film cameras. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#039;s probably way more than you wanted to know, but I hope it&#039;s at least a little bit helpful?  I hope.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After reading your posts intermittently, I decided to go back to the earlier posts and start at the beginning.  (that probably makes me sound a bit weird, but i have a ridiculously boring job)  I noticed that this post was when your pictures started to take on that ethereal saturated (beautiful) look...did you change cameras?  And if so, what do you shoot with?  My husband and I are notorious for our dark, shaky, vague pictures of delicious dishes in low lit restaurants and I thought it might be nice to start taking some better pictures of our cooking at home.  Thank you for all of your words...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently made this to help use up an over abundance of walnuts.  I used La Tourangelle roasted walnut oil.  The cake was just as good as you described.  I visited the La Tourangelle website to find more walnut oil recipes and found a recipe for apple walnut cake.  I just wanted to share my discovery with you. The apple macerates in brandy and results in a moist, fragrant, delicious cake.  In fact, I think I&#039;m going to go and make it again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anonymous, I&#039;d guess that this cake would keep just fine for up to three days or so.  The fresher it is, the better, but yes, you can certainly make it a day or so ahead. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Hope that helps!]]></description>
