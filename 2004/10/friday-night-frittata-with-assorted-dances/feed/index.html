					<description><![CDATA[Molly- I had never heard or Orangette until I stumbled upon your book last summer and proceeded to devour it in just 2 days while on a solo trip to my family&#039;s cottage. I&#039;ve since kept  up with recent posts, but after losing my job last week and ending up with extra hours on my hands, I decided to start from the beginning and read the entire blog! It&#039;s a beautiful day outside here in Boulder, but I can&#039;t tear myself away from the computer. I love your writing style, your photography, and of course the recipes and delicious descriptions of meals, from fancy weddings and dinners out to simple solo meals at home. We have many of the same &quot;food likes,&quot; including my summertime obsession with tomato sandwiches! I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be commenting on more future posts... but this one grabbed my attention having just made a frittata the other day. I&#039;ve never heard of inverting the frittata onto a plate to cook the &quot;top&quot;..usually when mine is almost set I stick it under the broiler to finish it off... and it gives the cheese on top a nice crunchy texture. I&#039;m going to try your way next time!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for sharing so candidly even though you don&#039;t know us... I already feel like I know you!&lt;br /&gt;:) Katie]]></description>
