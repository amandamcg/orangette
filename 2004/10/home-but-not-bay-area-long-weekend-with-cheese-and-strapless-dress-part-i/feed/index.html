					<description><![CDATA[If you like serrano ham, then try to get yourself a taste of &lt; HREF=&quot;http://www.ibergour.com/en/carrito/anadir_item.html?id_prod=jmdoe&amp;q=0&amp;p=7&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;spanish iberian ham&lt;&gt; (&quot;jam√≥n ib√©rico de bellota&quot;). It&#039;s darn expensive, but you will find out know why... BTW you will have to travel to europe, or somehow manage to get it (illegally) into the country, because to the date import of iberian ham is banned by US authorities. :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, my dears, you must get yourselves to San Francisco!  I‚Äôm tempted to move back there after I finish my Master‚Äôs thesis and this publishing internship, and Katie is actively campaigning for it‚Ä¶but the thought of leaving the great network of friends I‚Äôve slowly built in Seattle definitely makes me think twice.  We‚Äôll see.  A lot will depend on where I can get a job!  Luckily I‚Äôve got a year to mull it all over‚Ä¶&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Mark, I love that you think Katie and I look alike!  Although our mothers are identical (and I mean *identical*) twins, we cousins are such intricate combinations of our respective parents that at times I hardly see a resemblance at all.  But Katie is so adorable that I‚Äôd like to think we look (at least a bit) like we‚Äôre related!]]></description>
