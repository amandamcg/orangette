					<description><![CDATA[Pipstar, add it to the list!  I’m kicking myself for leaving the leftovers with Kate and Ian.  I’m crazy about those two, but what was I thinking?  It must have been the Red Stripe-induced euphoria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evan, glad to see you here—even if only guilt made you do it.  [Grrrrrrrr…]  Always happy to induce salivation.  And spread the gospel of selectively good grammar.  Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Amy, it’s a long long story.  Radically condensed version: the bastard called me at 8:45am and caught me trying to negotiate an armload of bag, ratatouille, Les Savy Fav, and the phone.  Claimed to be from my wireless provider, saying I had an overdue balance.  I was suspicious from the start and actually did get testy with him, but I just had too much going on to be fully “with it.”  I said I wouldn’t pay over the phone, but he knew all the usual and official things to say, and well, I figured that even if he was a fraud, what could he do with only the last four digits of my SS#?  Hot damn, now I know.  But even if I feel like an idiot, I’m proud to have sniffed out the rat from the start…which is why I looked into it as soon as I got to my office.  [By the way, this business of having an office is pretty hot stuff.  I mean, fancy building, my own phone line, computer, windows that look out on a concrete wall.  I correct other people’s punctuation all day, and I&#039;m ruthless.  Hot stuff, I am.]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Shit, this is so &quot;The Net.&quot; Do people really steal social security numbers, and how in the hell does one go about buying a cell phone with one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;m glad you got your identity back before it was gone too long.

					<description><![CDATA[Ever since I blithely commented to you that everyone has a blog site these days, I&#039;ve regretted it. So I checked yours out, partly out of guilt. I admire the way you write, possibly because it makes my mouth water when words so rarely do. (I never thought cauliflower could sound so delicious.) And yes, I too now have a blog site, I too am now part of the dismissable &quot;everyone&quot;. And yes, I do adore starting a sentence with &quot;And&quot;, grammar school be deviled. Me thinks I&#039;ll keep reading. Hold on to that identity with a tight little fist. TTFN]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh you poor thing! You are SO lucky that you found out what Mr Evil Liar-Man was doing so quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bet the cake made you feel so much better -it definitely sounds delicious. Am I going to have to add another Molly recipe to my list of &quot;must-dos&quot;?]]></description>
