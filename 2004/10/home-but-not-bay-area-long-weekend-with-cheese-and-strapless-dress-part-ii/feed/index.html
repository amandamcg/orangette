					<description><![CDATA[It was indeed a uniquely gorgeous wedding, although the sniffly nose and weird congested chest I seem to have brought home as souvenirs are, well, less than gorgeous!  Pusekatt, congratulations on your upcoming wedding, and thanks for coming to visit.  Looking forward to hearing about your San Francisco trip!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was sent this link by Pipstar. Can only say that I now feel quite inspired by the whole affair - my own wedding is in less than 6 months so anything wedding pricks up my fancy :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be in San Francisco in about 4 weeks so I will try to get my hands on the cheese you mentioned (Vella Dry Jack) and try to grab a bite at the Easy Street Cafe - huevos rancheros...yum!]]></description>
