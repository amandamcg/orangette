					<description><![CDATA[Mark, thanks for your thoughtful comments.  I love you people.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree wholeheartedly that the animal&#039;s quality of life is what matters most when discussing any of this.  When I chose to start eating meat again, I made a commitment to myself to be very, very picky about my sources--i.e. free-range, no hormones, etc.  Yes, I could just not eat meat, but I&#039;m here in this world for only a short time and want to experience it as fully as I can--while causing as little harm as possible.  And because food is so important to me, I felt as though I were really limiting myself and my knowledge by strictly avoiding all things meat-related.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I also recognize that a fundamental difference between leather products and fur lies in the fact that animals bred for fur are essentially wasted, not consumed, etc.  Pretty ugly and frivolous; there&#039;s no way around it.  I don&#039;t think I&#039;d ever purchase something fur for myself, but if offered, yes, I&#039;ll wear it.  I&#039;m full of contradictions.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the thing my mom is scheming about may well be fake!  Bottom line, m&#039;dears.]]></description>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly that the animal&#8217;s quality of life is what matters most when discussing any of this.  When I chose to start eating meat again, I made a commitment to myself to be very, very picky about my sources&#8211;i.e. free-range, no hormones, etc.  Yes, I could just not eat meat, but I&#8217;m here in this world for only a short time and want to experience it as fully as I can&#8211;while causing as little harm as possible.  And because food is so important to me, I felt as though I were really limiting myself and my knowledge by strictly avoiding all things meat-related.</p>
<p>And yes, I also recognize that a fundamental difference between leather products and fur lies in the fact that animals bred for fur are essentially wasted, not consumed, etc.  Pretty ugly and frivolous; there&#8217;s no way around it.

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry Molly, I didn&#039;t mean to cause a storm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I&#039;m on dodgy ground being a meat eater and anti-fur, but the way I see it, it is OK to breed animals for meat but not for clothes, leather and suede being the exceptions as they are by-products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just typing this however, I realise how silly my position is. Surely the quality of the animal&#039;s life is more important than its end use? I don&#039;t need to wear fur, but I also don&#039;t need to eat meat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eat meat (free range, ideally) because I like the taste. I love the feel of fur, but I just can&#039;t wear it. I&#039;m so hypocritical!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I remember hearing about some animal-rights activists who freed hundreds of mink from a fur-farm in the south of England a few years ago. Great? No. The mink, revelling in their freedom, decimated the local wildlife, including some sensitive ecosystems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is straight forward.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mister Underhill, there&#039;s no time like the present to start cooking for yourself!  Thanks for visiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark, I highly recommend the album Blazing Arrow.  Damn fine.  Sunny, upbeat, literate, funky, showy.  You will like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But oh no, I&#039;ve stepped into a controversy!  I&#039;m no raving champion of fur, but I&#039;ve never understood why it is demonized in a way that simple ole leather goods (usually) aren&#039;t.  It&#039;s all dead, right?  And meat for consumption?  Dead too.  So--hypothetically of course--how is eating a duck, chicken, or X alright when wearing fur is not?  [Vegans, please have mercy.] Oh, and for the record, I *am* a champion of free range meat, poultry, and eggs.  Yes yes.]]></description>
