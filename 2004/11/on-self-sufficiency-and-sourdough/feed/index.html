					<description><![CDATA[Have you tried folding your bread, rather than kneading it?  The process requires no dough hook. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Un-enriched dough (no milk, butter, oil, etc) is always better if you combine the flour and water, just enough to wet the flour, and allow the mixture to &quot;autolyse&quot; (rest) for 30 minutes.  The gluten in the flour can only work when hydrated. After the autolyse, you need to knead the dough only long enough to really dissolve the sourdough/yeast and salt.  Put the dough into a (preferably) large well oiled container to proof.  After 30 or 45 minutes (it depends on how long you&#039;re going to ferment the dough), rather than leaving the dough alone to proof, you will come back 3, 4, or even 5 times, lifting one side and folding it over to the opposite side.  Repeat this for all 4 sides and finally turn the whole mass over so that the &quot;seam&quot; is on the bottom.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;You will be amazed at the difference in your bread.    You will see a tremendous difference in the crumb and also the volume of oven spring.  AND your arms will start to shrink!  This folding process can be applied to any type of bread, fully mixed (fold twice) or barely mixed (more folds, usually at 30 minute intervals).  I believe Dan Leopard describes this process similarly in a book called the handmade loaf.  Joyous Baking to you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That guy&#039;s video cracked me up, especially when he compared his finished loaf to discovering that your long-lost child is Tom Selleck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applaud your pioneer efforts, Molly. I don&#039;t think I&#039;m quite ready for them myself but if you see a cute bonnet in the general store can you send it to me? I&#039;ve got a weekness for bonnets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fabulous post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I loved that post. If you kneed and shape bread as well as your words and sentences, you are surely a master-chef!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL try this sourdough thing when I get back home. I sounds fascinating!!]]></description>
