					<description><![CDATA[Aubrey, I&#039;m so sorry for not getting back to you sooner!  If it&#039;s not too late, know that this recipe doubles and triples (and, I assume, quadruples) just fine.  I&#039;ve tripled it a number of times now for Thanksgiving and other family get-togethers, and it works like a charm.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Happy Easter to you and yours...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Speaking of biscuits - how well does this recipe quadruple?  (I have a hoarde descending Sunday...)  And thanks for the Avalon Fish Market tip - I&#039;ll head there next week.  And I&#039;ll swing by Crescent Market - I always forget it&#039;s there, living in the rarified air of Edmond...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Aubrey in Edmond]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In the spirit of biscuit making and NPR, here are some words by Garrison Keillor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The first section of our show brought to you by Powdermilk Biscuits, in the big green box, made from whole wheat raised by Norwegian bachelor farmers, so you know they’re not only good for you, they’re also pure, mostly. Whole wheat that gives shy persons the strength to get up and do what needs to be done. Heavens they’re tasty, and expeditious.&quot;]]></description>
