					<description><![CDATA[Lovely Mother you have there and by now - 62?  Close to my age. I am not so lovely- kinda look like a cartoon- but what we do have in common is spitting cherry seeds- I love to buy a bag of Royal Anne’s- or a Bing will do- and drive along on a sunny day just spitting out those cherry seeds along the way. Pure Joy!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Charr]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for coming to visit, Viv!  I&#039;ve been checking in with your site (terrific, by the way) regularly for a while now but had yet to comment.  Much fun to find another blogging Seattlite--and a bon vivant to boot!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Molly, you are so lucky, and it&#039;s great you appreciate your good fortune!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother, despite being an absolute angel, was not a great fan of fine cuisine, so I was raised on a rather boring, processed diet. From this my love of &lt;&gt;real&lt;&gt; food was born, as rebellion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it can happen the other way too. A woman I shared a house with during my degree, Carol, was a real &#039;foodie&#039; and had a particular passion for Spanish food. I basically feasted on restaurant quality food for 12 months and learnt a lot, especially about the use of chili. Her son (20 y.o.) had been brought up on this diet and wanted nothing more than beans on toast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children eh? What a paradox!]]></description>
