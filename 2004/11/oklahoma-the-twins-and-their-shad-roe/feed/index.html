					<description><![CDATA[My wife brought home some shad roe, our first of the season, so I thought I would browse the i.net for some new shad roe ideas and came across your blog. &lt;/&gt;I was delighted with the story and the tasteful layout of your site. I have only read Orangette, but I look forward to reading more as time permits.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The way I eventually prepared my shad roe was to soak it and some tilapia fillets in heavy cream while I sautéed some shitake mushrooms, asparagus shallots, garlic, chopped parsley, and chopped chives in butter and white wine. I seasoned with salt and black pepper. After they softened a bit I placed the tilapia fillets in the same pan. A minute or so later I added the shad roe and enough of the heavy cream to make a nice sauce. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I served the dish with boiled new potatoes tossed with balsamic vinegar, capers, parsley, chives, salt and black pepper.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;The wine was an Alsatian Pinot D’ Alsace.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;One unrelated question please, how did you get your blog listed on Google?  I too have a blog and would like to get it listed on major search engines. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Michael]]></description>
