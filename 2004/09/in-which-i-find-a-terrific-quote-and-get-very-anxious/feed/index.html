					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;   I made your chocolate cake for a family dinner tonight and my children, grandchildren, and husband agreed that it was the best chocolate cake ever. Not too sweet, light and fluffy. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!&lt;br /&gt;   Bette Hanauer]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My dear Elizabeth!  Thank you for the early birthday wishes!  As you can *well* imagine, many many photos have been taken of the cake.  But seeing as I&#039;m still in the pre-digital era, it&#039;s an exercise in delaying gratification.  Running the film down to be developed this afternoon...then scanning...jumping through hoops and cartwheeling and somersaulting...and then photos galore!  If they aren&#039;t terrible.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And thank you for the kind words, afterthoughtsdog!  I&#039;m honored!  But I must say that if it&#039;s the photo of me you&#039;re referring to, credit actually goes to Elizabeth, impromptu shutter-clicker extraordinaire...]]></description>
