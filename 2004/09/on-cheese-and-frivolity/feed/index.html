					<description><![CDATA[I thought I had read all your posts....but in a fit of extreme boredom at work + life/career crisis, I started at page one to calm myself and lo and behold I stumbled upon this gem, unknown to me until now. Red Hawk is indeed one of the finest cheeses I have ever devoured, though certainly not for the faint of heart. We are celebrating our recent engagement this weekend....I think this occasion is grounds for a nice round of stinky deliciousness, don&#039;t you?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, Sarah, it sounds as though you might have had some bad cheese.  The wetness you describe - and the melted look of the rind - just doesn&#039;t sound right.  The rind can be a bit sticky and tacky to the touch, but not wet.  I wonder if the cheese was maybe stored in a place that was wet or had a lot of condensation?  And as for the smell and flavor, Red Hawk is stinky stuff, for sure, but the flavor should be smooth and creamy, more mild than its odor.  Somewhat pungent, but not bitter.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I hope that helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I am a recent reader of your blog- and hoprfully you can help with with a question on Red Hawk cheese.  I got this cheese for the first time over the weekend and I am trying to tell the difference between stinky cheese and BAD cheese.  The cheese smelled and tasted very bitter, when I opened the paper wrapping the cheese was wet and all of the brownigh orange color seemed to have melted off the rind.  Is there reason for concern?]]></description>
