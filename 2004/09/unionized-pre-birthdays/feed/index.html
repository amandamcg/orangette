					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m finally getting around to reading this blog from the beginning, and though I&#039;m a couple of years late, holy freaking COW. I started off reading the tasting menu sitting straight up in my office chair, looking for all intents and purposes like I was reading some very important, completely work related document. Somewhere around the fourth course, I noticed my chin was of it&#039;s own volition propped heavily on my left hand. Only towards the very end when I kid you not, my entire mid section sort of collapsed on me and sent me slumping down in my chair, elliciting a raised eyebrow from my boss, did I snap out of it and back to &quot;I&#039;m totally working over here, ALL the time&quot; attention. Time to go check ticket prices on Virgin America. At home, on my own time, of COURSE.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oooh, Lia - thank you, thank you!  I&#039;ve been wanting to get to Frankie&#039;s for a while now, but I hadn&#039;t heard of the others.  Brooklyn calls - loudly!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It would have been great to have you there! We also loved Matt&#039;s in the Market..&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;As for Brooklyn restaurants, I have a whole list of them which I direct friends and co-workers to whenever they ask me for restaurant recs. You can find it here: http://thislittlepiglet.blogspot.com/2006/07/brooklyn-restaurants.html&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;My absolute faves on that list are (in no particular order): Saul, Locanda Vini y Oli, Alma, The Good Fork, Chestnut, Frankie&#039;s 457 and Superfine. But they&#039;re really all so good. If you&#039;re ever in Brooklyn, let me know! I&#039;d love to meet you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Lia, I&#039;m so glad!  I&#039;m only sorry that I wasn&#039;t there with you.  Brandon and I keep meaning to go check out the bar menu at Union - I hear great things - but when an opportunity arises, we never seem to think of it.  Argh!  Must. Get. To. Union.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;And thanks for the offer of NYC / Brooklyn recommendations - if you have some favorites, please do tell!  Brandon has his own, of course, but I&#039;d love to hear yours.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks to this post, I had a delicious dinner at Union in Seattle earlier this summer. If you ever need any food recommendations for New York or Brooklyn, I&#039;d be happy to offer some, though it seems like Brandon&#039;s got you covered!]]></description>
