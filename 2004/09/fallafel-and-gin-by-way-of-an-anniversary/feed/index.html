					<description><![CDATA[respectfully, there is a better way to the perfect G/T. The ingredients are largely the same, but we add an important one, time. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Pour your gin of choice into a tall glass. Add the juice of half a lime, and the lime rind. Muddle, to release the rind&#039;s oils, for :30 seconds. Then wait for a minimum of two minutes for everything to magically soften. (Ever eaten ceviche?)&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Add a dash of bitters. Add fresh ice cubes, then slowly pour very fresh tonic from a fresh, small bottle (or fresh can; Whole Foods makes decent tonic) gently down the side of the glass. Add a fresh spritz of lime, and enjoy blissful repose, witty banter, and the light from the slanting sun. &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;-DRC]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[upon above inspiration i stopped by olive branch on 80th +lake city today; now the previous owner/proprietor used to serve the most perfect falafel i had had in the area--perfectly seasoned, encrusted in something smokey and nutty (pistachio, yes), served alongside the freshest of fresh, not too much tahini-yogurt, all wrapped in pita still piping hot, or nearly so, from the oven. i used to watch with amazement as neighborhood folks would stop in and have their pitas and flatbreads baked to order; nothing so cool as a tray of hot bread resembling mini-volleyballs before it does cool and flatten like griddlecakes. too bad she left. the place is still there and is still good--just not nearly what it once was. plus, it was closed today.]]></description>
