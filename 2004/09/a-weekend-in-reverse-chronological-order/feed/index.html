					<description><![CDATA[I have to admit that I jaywalk too (actually in Australia it&#039;s legal so pretty much everyone does it!) however it&#039;s the style with which you do it. There will be no dawdling thank you very much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I wasn&#039;t eating lunch with you today -well it would have been nice just the two of us but definitely not with turkey-eating and spitting people! -)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh no!  I&#039;m a jaywalker!  Oh no oh no!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do have to agree with you, pipstar, regarding people who chew with their mouths open.  I hadn&#039;t thought much about it until I read your comment, but then I found myself having lunch today with someone who managed to somehow get little chunks of sliced turkey from her sandwich onto her neck(!) and the back of her hand.  Very distracting and oddly disturbing.  I felt very protective of my little corner of the table.  I am now fully in agreement with you.]]></description>
