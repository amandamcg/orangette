					<description><![CDATA[Oh Molly. Your posts about food always make me hungry! I have a plum tree in the garden, so I will have to try your mouthwatering recipe... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if Macromedia will ever develop a &#039;scratch and sniff&#039; add-on for web sites???]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mmmm, plum preserves sound delicious, amylou!  Can&#039;t wait to hear more about them!  &lt;br /&gt;As for your pitting woes, hmmm, I&#039;m not sure.  I&#039;ve never had trouble removing the pit from prune plums--it just comes out cleanly.  But I did buy some prune plum lookalikes this summer called French sugar plums, and I had a hell of a time getting the pits neatly out of those.  I wonder if it&#039;s a slight difference in varietal?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly! Your timing is impeccable. I have a bag full of what I think are prune plums in my fridge, freshly picked from a plum tree at a friend&#039;s house. I actually have my heart set on making plum preserves. The thing is, the last (and only) time I tried baking with plums, I had a devil of a time pitting them. Okay, you slice all around and twist, just like an avocado. But how do you extract the pit without mangling the half where it&#039;s still attached? Off to buy a cinnamon stick for the preserves now...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, my dear pipstar, I&#039;m not sure if or when we might get a glimpse of Margot&#039;s new series...but let&#039;s just hope the photos turn out alright, or else I&#039;ll be wearing that dress AGAIN!  That said, however, I do have a few photos of our outing--and of the plum tart--and will hopefully get them posted tomorrow night.  My not having a digital camera makes things so complicated.  Hmph.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for things involving plums, you should also check out an old post of mine in which I talk about a plum torte, which may be more like the plum cakes you&#039;ve had in Germany: http://orangette.blogspot.com/2004/08/few-of-my-favorite-things-as-inspired.html.  And re: prune plums, hmmm.  You might see them in the market under the name Italian plums, French plums, prune plums, or maybe even quetsches.  They are oblong and a bit smaller than an egg, with dark purple dusty skin and a slightly greenish to brown interior.  Sooo delicious.  I&#039;ve been a little bit obsessive about them this summer, as you might be able to see...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are we going to be seeing some of these pictures?? :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I am very interested in trying this plum cake (I really am going to have to stop reading your blog if this continues!). Every time I go to Germany I gorge myself on plum cake and it is so divine but I have never tried to make it myself. How will I identify prune plums? I don&#039;t think I have seen them here! Is it a particular type of plum?]]></description>
