					<description><![CDATA[I make this recipe quote a bit and it never exactly works out like I think it should. I am writing to ask you for some help hoping you can+ offer some tips when it comes to roasting vegetables. When I use the mandolin I get a lot of cauliflower crumbs. The crumbs end up burning. The larger pieces caramelize but they never cook through so they are raw tasting. Turning the pieces over midway does not really work because you can only turn over larger pieces and there are a lot of smaller ones that would take a long time to turn. Tossing does not work either because not everything that is tossed lands on the other side. I appreciate whatever you may have to say on this subject. Thank you!]]></description>
