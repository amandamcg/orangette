					<description><![CDATA[Pipstar, my dear, I&#039;m going to e-mail you the ratatouille recipe I use as a guide, so keep an eye on your inbox.  And as for the potatoes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boil whole small potatoes--fingerlings, Yukon Golds, German Butterballs, red new potatoes, or something similar--in salted water until a paring knife slides in easily, 10 to 20 minutes, depending on size.  Drain and rinse for a minute or two with cold water.  Halve or quarter potatoes (your choice, depending on size), and place in a bowl.  Add a splash of apple cider vinegar (or any vinegar you like), and salt and pepper liberally.  Shake bowl to toss potatoes, then let sit for a few minutes to cool a bit and allow vinegar to soak in.  You should be able to smell the vinegar clearly if you put your nose over the bowl, but it should just coat the potatoes, not pool or puddle.  Drizzle with fragrant olive oil and sprinkle with chopped fresh dill, then toss and serve.]]></description>
