					<description><![CDATA[I went looking for your rhubarb recipes this morning, and this thumbnail was one of the search results. With the title &quot;Two Years&quot; and a cute little girl in the photo, I clicked, thinking, &quot;oh, Molly must have written something sweet for June Bug&#039;s second birthday. That will brighten my morning.&quot;

But of course, it&#039;s not June in the photo. It&#039;s you. 
Molly, thank you for letting me, a complete stranger, share in your life. My heart is warm and full and my belly is often the same because of your writing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly - I read the chapters on your Dad&#039;s illness and death today on the train into work this morning.  Your words there - and here, in this old post - were so deeply moving and hit a nerve for me in so many ways.  I would imagine that anyone who&#039;s ever lost someone to cancer can relate, in a way, to what you&#039;ve gone through with your Dad.  Thanks for sharing such a deeply moving and personal story.  And for the record, your Dad sounds like a hoot - I would have loved to have known him!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had many big losses so far. I am sure I will have more. I still do not understand why good people leave us so early (and I am over my forties). That&#039;s why I believe like you that they are always around, even when they are not physically anymore. That&#039;s the only comfort I have found since my losses started. Thanks for sharing your history.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just discovered your blog about three days ago, working backwards through while I eat my meals! I just read this post and definitely cried the whole way through. My father and I were never close, but my father-in-law was amazing. He was diagnosed with stage 4 non-Hodgkin&#039;s lymphoma a year after he retired and died a year later. Throughout his illness he couldn&#039;t eat many of his favorite things, but near the end, the doctor told him he could have his favorite, vanilla ice cream from Fenton&#039;s in Oakland. I remember helping him eat this favorite treat and him looking so very happy. Thank you for sharing this, it brought this memory back tonight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TT]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking about you and your dad and family, and how you describe in your book your family being together at home during his last weeks, taking care of him and of each other.&lt;br /&gt;My dad is so sick. I don’t know if he’ll make it. But our story is so different. This is why I came to look again at your dad posts.&lt;br /&gt;I want to write about it, to let it all out, but it’s scary.&lt;br /&gt;My father left me when I was about 3 years old and moved to another continent and moved on with his life. Like a friend recently told me – I have already lost him a long time ago and practically all my life.&lt;br /&gt;Our family is so separated too. I feels so lonely.&lt;br /&gt;It makes me happy though to hear storied of families like yours, where people help each other, love each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(By the way, you signed my copy of your book “To Molly” – how funny is that?)]]></description>
