					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely delicious!&lt;br /&gt;Many of your staples have become my staples, too over the past year, and I would just like to thank you very much. Not only are your recipes always (and I mean ALWAYS) fantastic, but your writing is wonderful as well, and reading your posts puts me in mind of late summer evenings and legs dangling from a bridge, toes grazing the stream below.&lt;br /&gt;This may be a weird thing to say, but you remind me of my mother in attitude and style (younger, obviously, though I&#039;m only 16), and I find real comfort in this blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gosh, all that to say I loved the soup!&lt;br /&gt;I did add a a good lump of ginger, but other than that followed your instructions to the word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much,&lt;br /&gt;Hannah]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Elaine, I&#039;m sorry for the lateness of this reply!  I&#039;m not sure what mace is called in the UK, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mace_(spice)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s an explanation of what it is.  (It comes from the fruit of the nutmeg tree.)  If you can&#039;t find it, you can omit it.  And as for the apple cider, what I mean is unfiltered apple juice.  (Not alcoholic.)  If you can&#039;t find it, you can use any kind of good, flavorful apple juice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry, also, when you say apple cider do you mean alcoholic apple cider, because I think that&#039;s all we can get here, I&#039;m being difficult, sorry. Thanks Elaine]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, it looks like I&#039;m six years late getting to this recipe, but can I ask what mace is? I&#039;m from Scotland, does it have a different name in the UK maybe? Thanks, Elaine]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the recipe.&lt;/&gt;I like it better than most squash soups, of which I can only get through a few spoonfuls, even though they taste good. Must be because it&#039;s half applesauce...&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;www.breadbabies.blogspot.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tonight, I made my first &quot;big-girl&quot; soup. This is my senior year of college, and I had yet to break-in the biggest pot in my cupboard, but tonight I made &quot;history&quot; ... all thanks to you.&lt;/&gt;I stumbled across your blog just a few days ago and, while browsing the recipe index, fell in love with the idea of apples, squash and their lovechild: this amazing soup.&lt;/&gt;With a few alterations (I can&#039;t afford cardamom, but I do have cinnamon!) including adding some hot sausage for extra flavor and texture, I conquered this soup and my fear of cooking things for more than 20 minutes.&lt;/&gt;As per your suggestion, I&#039;m letting the flavors meld in the fridge until I serve on Saturday, but my roommates taste tests all agree: you deserve a hearty thanks for crafting such an agreeable, perfectly warming wintery soup.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is an extremely late comment, but I only discovered your blog this summer. When I saw the picture of the Arizmendi brioche, I had to comment since I am a diehard Arizmendi/Cheese Board fan. You have exquisite taste!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Speaking of stockpots, I have a story to share. Jacques Pepin and Julia Child were signing cookbooks at SF Union Square Macy&#039;s years ago, when they were working on another PBS series together.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I hurried from class across the Bay, hoping to get there in time to see  and appreciate their lovely banter in person. I made it, but they had run out of the Julia and Jacques series cookbooks for signing...except for those included with a 12-quart stockpot they endorsed. A rash decision (and my non-foodie friends teased me endlessly about it), but it had to be done!&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Thanks always for sharing your stories and recipes. They are such a treat and very useful to those abroad without their cookbooks!]]></description>
