					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s extra easy and cheap to make your own runny yogurt if you have a thermos bottle of some sort. I use a 1 quart thermos coffee server.   Here&#039;s what you do...&lt;br /&gt;Makes 1 quart.&lt;br /&gt;1. Buy a small cup of your favorite yogurt that has live organisms to use for culture.  &lt;br /&gt;2. Heat 3 cups of milk to near boiling.  Put the lid on to let it cool down to about 104 degrees. Feels a little warmer than body temperature. Never too hot, it will kill your organisms. &lt;br /&gt;3. Put the cup of yogurt into the warm milk, stir well.&lt;br /&gt;4. Pour into your thermos, cap and let sit for 8-12 hours. It gets firmer and more acidic over time. (I like it at 8 hrs, mild and runny)) &lt;br /&gt;5. Pour your yogurt into a quart jar with tight cover.  Add sweetner, fruit, flavoring to suit.  I like a squirt of stevia (natural sweetner) and a teaspoon of vanilla. Cap and gently shake. Refrigerate.  Serve over granola...I never get tired of it! Yum! &lt;br /&gt;Tips: &lt;br /&gt;--Don&#039;t use aluminum pans, utensils, or storage containers for yogurt, it&#039;s slightly acidic.&lt;br /&gt;--Use very clean thermos, and start each batch with a purchased yoghurt cup.  Wild yeast and bacteria from the environment can easily contaminate it and you&#039;ll end up with sour milk.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve  tried making this recipe 3 times and it came out kind of &quot;rubbery&quot;.  I made it again and left out the honey and the oil, and added 1/3 cup each of sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and ground flax seeds.  Then toasted it as directed and it has the crispy consistency&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for.  I don&#039;t add honey when I&#039;m eating it, but add fruit instead -- grapes are wonderful with it especially in the fall.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi - Just saw your everyday granola recipe in Bon Appetit - I&#039;ve been making my own granola for years - I&#039;ve discovered a way to make it without oil and it sticks together just fine.  I whisk 3 egg whites with 1/3 cup honey or pure maple syrup and mix it all together - it seems to do the trick!]]></description>
