					<description><![CDATA[I love this bread!  I have also made your buckwheat pancakes (from A Homemade Life) so many times that I have the recipe memorized.  I just started adapting it to add about 1/2 cup of pumpkin puree (I increase the flour by 1/2 cup, add pumpkin spice, make the leavening amounts heaping, and increase the milk a little.)  Then I have about a cup of puree left to make this bread. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I liked it the first day but I thought some other recipe I used previously was a bit better, BUT since I didn&#039;t have time to eat it the second day, I packed it to bring on a trip, it was so amazing on the 3rd and 4th days. So moist, melting in your mouth, even being a bit sticky. Yummy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made this the other day &amp; it was good--will use this as my standard pumpkin bread recipe.  I wanted to make one similar to the ones they sell at Starbucks (which is not too sweet).  I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar (inc. 1/2 cup brown).

					<description><![CDATA[Michele said...&lt;br /&gt;I made the Pumpkin Bread recipe using local See Canyon (Central Coast of California) roasted winter squash baked with honey and cinnamon, then blended.  I substituted the water with strong coffee. I roasted half pecans until toasted and didn&#039;t cut them smaller.  I used 3 kinds of sugar: brown, white, and Turbinado.  The next time I will use French baking spice from French Market Spice for a twist on the flavor.  I will bake it a little longer too.  But definitely a five-star recipe.  Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My son, Lysander, is a pumpkin FREAK loves loves LOVES it.  I am always doing pumpkin recipes for him and then he tells me, Mom, it is the pie I love really.  I should have figured he has asked for it for his birthday for years.  &lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;I like to grow them and last year grew a good batch; thinking the Grandkids would come and harvest from my yard.  Yet the call of the wonderful pumpkin patches with *activities* won out and they didn&#039;t get mine- and many were wasted.  Near the end with one nice one still remaining, I finally get my son to get it baked-and baked-and baked some more.  He left the oven on all night.  Such a sad sad tale.&lt;/&gt;&lt;/&gt;Ever heard of the recipe where you use a cake baked and torn to bits mixed with pumpkin pie ingredients and baked with pecans added &amp; a lot of extra butter on top?  It’s finished with a cream cheese whip cream type frosting and pecans.  It is a very dense cake- I often hear it referred to as “pumpkin stuff”- fitting name indeed.]]></description>
