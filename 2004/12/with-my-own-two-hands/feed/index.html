					<description><![CDATA[I just bundled up four packages of goodies to ship (to family and friends in OK!) with the lion share being your toffee.  Of course, had to keep the less perfect pieces for sampling.  This is a beautiful, yummy recipe.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I made this two days ago, and it was DELICIOUS. I used Valrhona 73% and El Rey 34%, and, as I always say when I buy real chocolate, it was worth it. thank you, and thank your mom for me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Pusekatt!  Good to see you back--and glad you managed to grab a cannele in San Francisco!  I&#039;m hoping to get my hands on one next week, in fact.  And thank you for your sweet words about my dad.  It&#039;s meant a lot to me that people like you have responded so thoughtfully to that post...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hallo!&lt;br /&gt;I have missed reading your blog - why is it that I had breakfast just over an hour ago but looking at your blog photos makes me so hungry?&lt;br /&gt;The recipes sound awesome and i do wish I had the drive to cook more. Perhaps that can be my new year&#039;s resolution. To cook a new dish every week...&lt;br /&gt;BTW, loved your entry regarding &#039;Burg&#039; - very touching. He sounded like a great man.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and also, whilst in San Francisco 2 weeks ago, I went to the Boulangerie at Cole Valley and had me a cannele de Bordeaux - it was absolutely divine!]]></description>
