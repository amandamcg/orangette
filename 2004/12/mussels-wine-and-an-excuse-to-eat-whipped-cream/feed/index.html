					<description><![CDATA[Molly, I&#039;m cleaning out my freezer here in Arizona before heading east for the summer and found some of the dreaded frozen bananas. I had just a cup of chocolate chips on hand and a little bit of candied ginger so was inspired to make your banana bread instead of my go to Gourmet banana cake with coconut frosting. It&#039;s in the oven and if it tastes half as good as it smells we&#039;re in for a delicious treat. Thanks! Sue]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mandy, I&#039;ve baked mini loaves of this banana bread, and they came out very well!  You&#039;ll want to use the same oven temperature, and hmmm, I can&#039;t remember exactly how long they took to bake, but I would start checking around 20 minutes?  When they&#039;re done, they should be golden brown on top, and if you stick a toothpick in the center, it should come out clean...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Molly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved your book, and am now loving your blog.  After reading your book, my first thought was I have to make this banana bread!!  But I was wondering, could you or another reader tell me if I wanted to make small loaves for gifts, what would be the temperature and the baking time?  I think this would make a good friend/coworker Christmas gift.  Thanks!!  Mandy in Alabama]]></description>
