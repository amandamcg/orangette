					<description><![CDATA[Nooooo! dont throw those shells away. The stock made from them is amazing. Usual suspects fenel carrot leek onion bay leaf.&lt;br /&gt;Same goes for those bird carcuss and bones.&lt;br /&gt;All the bad stuff is obliterated when boiled. &lt;br /&gt;Rissotos never tasted so good.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware though anthrax survives boiling. &lt;br /&gt;I used to bin shells and bones. Then I read some things by the master of thrift and friend and advisor to Gordon Ramsay  &quot;Hugh Fearnley Whitingstall&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Loving your site]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now that&#039;s what I call a Christmas dinner to remember - unbelievably good, but no fuss at the same time. &lt;/&gt;How cool would it be to be able to just bung the remnants of an enormous feast into the trash at the end of the day  =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow- What a gorgeous dinner! I see you found full-sized crabs more appealing than the miniature one at my house. Alas, I understand completely. The crumble looks ridiculously wonderful, can&#039;t wait to try out the recipe here.  Kate]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That sounds and looks lovely! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merry Dungeness crabs, Molly ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully they were from Dungeness in Washington rather than Dungeness in England, which is only known for it&#039;s nuclear power station!! How many claws did they have??]]></description>
