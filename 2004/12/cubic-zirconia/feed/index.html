					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reading your blog now because my sister bought me your first book for my Kindle. Loved it! Once, in Seattle, we went to Falafel King, it&#039;s down there by the Pike Market, somewhere. I had the best Greek salad, dressing had raw garlic, it was wonderful! Have you ever been there? Could you blog about that salad dressing? charlesandronda@yahoo.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ok, gotta say that my boy bought me white gold and diamond earrings a week ago. I could have worn them for Christmas but I decided to save them for my wedding in April. I did decide to leave them at the shop to avoid temptation.&lt;br /&gt;*sigh* here&#039;s hoping for more diamonds to come my way :-) but I must say that pink ice would do me just fine!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, you two!  Happy holidays, and may there be diamonds, diamonds everywhere!  If not, &quot;pink ice&quot; will do, I suppose.  But let&#039;s pull for the real thing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[CZ days and weeks? What wise words!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#039;t wait to find an opportunity to use the phrase in conversation, thereby making myself sound sooo very witty ;-)&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it is great to be back home and reading cool blogs like yours.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you have a great time in San Francisco and that you provide many details of your menu planning - mmmm, my mouth is watering just thinking about it!&lt;br /&gt;Have a great Christmas...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cubic zirconian weeks all around. I like that comparison because, although c.z. doesn&#039;t shine like diamonds, it&#039;s still pretty in a ridiculous kind of way. And most grumpy days are hardly without their sparkly sides. In fact, when things are bad, and there is no chocolate to wear, why not embrace the mediocrity and don some &quot;pink ice&quot; jewelry? Just the name &quot;pink ice&quot; is bound to be a mood enhancer, no?]]></description>
