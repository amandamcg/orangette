					<description><![CDATA[Just found your blog and decided to try this recipe. I have not tried it with sweet potatoes yet (the puree is in the fridge cooling down, that&#039;s next) but I did just make a batch with some butternut squash puree that I had in the fridge. Yum! Baking some ham later this evening and I thought having these on hand would be perfect for left overs! Thanks for such a fantastic blog. I cannot wait to read about and eat more of your recipes! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sarah]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just whipped up your butternut, pear, cider, vanilla soup from leftover roasted squash and it made my day.  But there was MORE squash, so I used it to make these biscuits, and what a good idea that was!  I switched out the sugar for maple syrup and used the white whole wheat flour that I&#039;ve been addicted to since I made your chocolate chip cookies.  I&#039;m looking forward to a crispy piece of peppered bacon inside a biscuit.  You&#039;re just great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chrissie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Molly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I&#039;ve loved your column in BA for some time, I&#039;m new to your blog.  But I LOVE it!!  And I am about 2/3 of the way done with your amazing book...  So in just shy of two weeks, I feel you have changed my life - and my kitchen - for the better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made these biscuits this weekend and oh. my. god.  They&#039;re amazing.  In fact, embarrassingly enough, my husband and I ate them ALL within two days (and for some reason my batch even made 10 biscuits!).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am all-too-comfortably settling into the idea that I will try all or most of your recipes in the coming months and honestly, it&#039;s one of the only things I am looking forward to as much as I am! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your wonderful contributions - I have a lot of fun reading whatever it is you have to say :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy new year and best wishes,&lt;br /&gt;Debra]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I want to make these right now! They look wonderful and sweet potatoes are one of my favorite foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you have any suggestions what to use instead of ham for people who don&#039;t eat pork and don&#039;t mix meat and dairy (read: keep kosher).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Here from abchao, hashai.com]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anonymous, I&#039;m so sorry for not replying sooner!  I&#039;m sure this reply comes &lt;&gt;way&lt;&gt; too late, but on the off chance that you&#039;re still interested in making these, yes, I do think that you could use milk soured with lemon juice instead of the buttermilk.  It should work just fine.]]></description>
