    <p>So, how many of you, after reading last week’s food section of <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span>, made a batch of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/dining/091crex.html?ref=dining">chocolate chip cookies</a>?   I can’t possibly be the only one susceptible to suggestion around here.  Hands up, now.  Don’t be shy.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/b98eb-polachocchipdough1.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/b98eb-polachocchipdough1.jpg?w=300" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5222914859518020178" border="0" /></a><br />Okay, so, for those of you who made the cookies, how many ate them at every meal for multiple days, to the near-complete exclusion of other foods?  I ask not only because I did, but because these cookies <span style="font-style:italic;">deserve </span>to be eaten that way, in extravagant quantities.  I mean, just <span style="font-style:italic;">look</span> at them. A mere glimpse makes me want to pour a big glass of iced coffee and do something immoderate.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/d61df-polachocchip1.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/d61df-polachocchip1.jpg?w=296" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5222914866034819122" border="0" /></a><br />The sad part is, I would have overlooked this recipe entirely if Brandon, in his diligent, good-citizen, news-reading way, hadn’t e-mailed me a link to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/dining/09chip.html?_r=1&amp;em&amp;ex=1215748800&amp;en=ef89958272faeb99&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;oref=slogin">the article</a> last Wednesday.  I was sitting at my desk, reading something far less important, when it landed in my inbox.  There was no accompanying commentary &#8211; just the link &#8211; but I knew what he was saying.   I promptly stood up, walked to the fridge, removed the requisite butter, and set it on the counter to soften, and that night, I made cookie dough. (This is, incidentally, part of a top secret strategy I am developing called Kill Him with Kindness and Cookies and Maybe He Will Clean His Closet Without You Having to Ask Him Again.  Don’t tell Brandon.  So far, it’s not working very well, but I still have hope.)</p>
<p>I won’t attempt to paraphrase the article here, because you really should read it. <a href="http://www.leitesculinaria.com/index.html">David Leite</a>, its author, is a wonderful writer, and those of you who like to bake will find it very informative. (Plus, it quotes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Corriher">Shirley Corriher</a>!  I <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2007/11/great-relief.html">love</a> Shirley Corriher.) What I <span style="font-style:italic;">will</span> say about it, however, is that it adds up to a very fine, very fetching cookie.  In fact, it is, without a doubt, the best chocolate chip cookie that I have ever made at home.  It is also the best chocolate chip cookie that I have ever eaten.  It scares me a little to make such a bold statement, but I have decided to do it anyway.</p>
<p>Leite’s recipe, which was adapted from Jacques Torres, produces a model specimen: big and plump and nubbly, with plenty of those endearing cracks and folds that form on the surface as the dough softens and spreads in the oven. The cookies are soft and chewy at the center, but their edges are nicely crisped, and then you’ve got their flavor, which develops over 36 hours (don’t skimp! it’s worth it!) of rest time that the dough gets before baking.  The flavor is classic chocolate chip, of course, but it has an unusual depth and complexity and, for the clincher, a sprinkling of salt on top.  You know how, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlotte’s Web</span>, Charlotte writes “SOME PIG” over Wilbur’s pen? Well, we’ve been seeing a lot of spiders around the house lately, and these cookies are sufficiently good that I half-expect to see the words “SOME COOKIES” appear, written in spider silk, in one of the corners of our kitchen. They really are some cookies.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/052bc-polachocchipballs1.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/052bc-polachocchipballs1.jpg?w=300" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5222914864175758098" border="0" /></a><br />Before I shoo you away from your desk and into the kitchen to make a batch, I want to share a few thoughts about the recipe.  David Leite clearly went to great pains to make it very specific and thorough, but I couldn’t help but make a few tweaks, mainly for convenience’s sake.  First, I didn’t bother with the fancy chocolate disks or <span style="font-style:italic;">fèves</span> that he calls for.  I like nice chocolate as much as the next guy, but I had to draw the line on this one.  I didn’t want to get in the car. Maybe next time, I’ll pick up the fancy kind, but for now, I will use my standard chocolate chip of choice, <a href="http://www.ghirardelli.com/products/chips_bittersweet.aspx">Ghirardelli 60%</a>.  I think it’s perfectly delicious.</p>
<p>Second, I didn’t use a mixture of cake and bread flours, as the recipe suggests.  Leite’s article failed to explain why the use of two flours is important, and I don’t know, it just seemed like a fussy complication.  I have no doubt that it probably does <span style="font-style:italic;">something</span>, texture-wise, but I was willing to take a risk, so I skipped it.  Instead, I used a local flour that we’ve been trying lately.  It’s called <a href="http://www.stone-buhr.com/flours/">Stone-Buhr Northwest-Grown All-Purpose Flour</a>, and if you can find it, I highly recommend it.  Otherwise, you might try your regular brand of all-purpose flour, or, as Leite recommends, a combination of cake and bread flours.</p>
<p><del>Lastly, after the dough had its 36 hours in the fridge, I let it soften a little bit at room temperature before I tried to scoop it.  It was very hard when freshly chilled, but with about 30 minutes’ to one hour’s rest on the counter, it was more readily scoopable.   Don’t let the dough get warm, though; you want to bake it while it’s still cool, and even tending toward cold.</del> <i><b>Updated on June 15, 2011</i></b>: I have changed the way I do this.  I now scoop the dough <b>before</b> chilling it.  Much easier.  See below.</p>
<p>Anyway, however you do it, MAKE THESE COOKIES.  And then heed my warning: unless you have a large household, give at least <span style="font-style:italic;">some</span> of them away to friends and next-door neighbors, or else you will eat yourself silly.  In a good way.  And a bad way.  I took a few to our neighbor, gave three to Olaiya, and delivered a half dozen to our friends <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2008/05/entirely-unmannerly.html">Ben</a> and Bonnie, who live conveniently nearby.  None of them complained, and in fact, Olaiya stopped by this morning to ask for more.  Which, I think, means that I should make another batch.</p>
<p>P.S.  You do know, right, that you can click on any photograph here and view in a larger size?  I know that bigger can be better sometimes, especially when it comes to cookies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Chocolate Chip Cookies</span><br />Adapted from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/09/dining/091crex.html?ref=dining"><span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span></a>, David Leite, and Jacques Torres</p>
<p>If you have a kitchen scale, I highly recommend using it here.  This recipe is written in both volume and weight, but I chose to use the latter, so that I wouldn’t have to mess with measuring cups.  It was unbelievably quick: just put a bowl on top of the scale, tare it to zero, and go.</p>
<p>2 cups minus 2 Tbsp. (8 ½ oz.) cake flour<br />1 2/3 cups (8 ½ oz.) bread flour<br />1 ¼ tsp. baking soda<br />1 ½ tsp. baking powder<br />1 ½ tsp. coarse salt, such as kosher<br />2 ½ sticks (1 ¼ cups; 10 oz.) unsalted butter, softened<br />1 ¼ cups (10 oz.) light brown sugar<br />1 cup plus 2 Tbsp. (8 oz.) granulated sugar<br />2 large eggs<br />2 tsp. vanilla extract<br />1 ¼ pounds bittersweet chocolate chips or chunks, preferably about 60% cacao content, such as <a href="http://www.ghirardelli.com/products/chips_bittersweet.aspx">Ghirardelli</a><br />Sea salt, such as Maldon</p>
<p>Combine flours, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.  Whisk well; then set aside.</p>
<p>Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars until very light and fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.  Reduce the mixer speed to low; then add dry ingredients, and mix until just combined.  (Unless you have a plastic guard that sits around the rim of the bowl, this will make a big mess at first, with flour flying everywhere.  I found that carefully holding a dish towel around the top of the bowl helped a lot.)  Add the chocolate chips, and mix briefly to incorporate.  Using a standard-size ice cream scoop – mine holds about 3 fluid ounces, or about 1/3 cup – scoop the dough onto a sheet pan or large platter, or anything that will hold about two dozen dough portions in a single layer.  Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and chill for 24 to 36 hours &#8211; and up to six days.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to bake, preheat oven to 350°F.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat.</p>
<p>Place six mounds of dough on the baking sheet, making sure to space them evenly. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt, and bake until golden brown but still soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack for 10 minutes, then transfer the cookies onto the rack to cool a bit more.</p>
<p>Repeat with remaining dough.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Note</span>: I may be the only person in the world who feels this way, but I like room-temperature chocolate chip cookies better than warm ones.  (Yes, I fully expect to be burned at the stake for saying this.)  When they’re warm, they taste too rich to me, and some of the nuances of their flavor get lost.  I suggest that you try these cookies both ways and decide for yourself.</p>
<p>Yield: About 24 (5-inch) cookies.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve been using Alton Brown&#8217;s recipe that called for all bread flour (The Chewy from three chips for sister marsha or whatever), and I really like the texture it gives my cookies over the plain all-purpose, but I don&#8217;t have good local AP Flour, just your average grocery store business.  Maybe the lightness of the cake flour and the chewy glutenous nummminess of the bread flour is for those of us with that dilemma =D</p>

      <p>After researching where to get the chocolate thingies and noticing how expensive that would be, I bought the Ghiradelli 60% today (BEFORE reading your post).  I&#8217;m planning to start the process tomorrow.  My son loves chocolate chip cookies and is going off into the woods later this week and this would be a perfect camping treat.</p>

      <p>Just made some chocolate chip cookies at the request of my sweet husband. For the first time in my life, I didn&#8217;t use the old family recipe, and I ended up loving them way more than any chocolate chip cookies I&#8217;ve ever had. I don&#8217;t know about this recipe, though. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re good, but the two flours and the fancy chocolate and the salt on top just strays too far from the classic, old-fashioned goodness that chocolate chip cookies are to me. Sorry, but I probably won&#8217;t make these.</p>

      <p>36 hours to wait before baking? I&#8217;m not sure I could restrain myself, I might just eat the dough instead.  I would agree that the combo of cake and bread flour has something to do with texture, since I think the protein contents are different?</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m a fan of the warm cookie too!  Fresh out of the oven, you don&#8217;t get the benefit of the variations in texture, and like you say, the flavor is almost too rich.  Although maybe it&#8217;s just because when the cookies are hot, I&#8217;m still recovering from all the cookie dough that I ate &#8212; something about that raw flour taste&#8230;</p>

      <p>As some of your commenters have suggested it is the different protein levels in the flour that makes the textural difference. Cake flour has decrased gluten content leaving you with a softer dough and a more melt-in-your-mouth texture for the cookie. While the AP flour has more gluten leaving you with a stiffer dough and chewier cookie. The gluten development also depends on how much you work the cookie dough too.</></>I like chewy cookies.</p>

      <p>I absolutely printed out the recipe, and have an event that I&#8217;m going to make them for (the equivalent of giving them away). Then after I try it with cake and bread flours, I&#8217;m going to try it with some portion of whole wheat or spelt flour.</p>

      <p>wowsers, these look good.   i love that the article attributes some of the goodness to the &#8220;aging&#8221; of the cookies.  how many times have i made cookie dough, didn&#8217;t have time to bake or wanted to wait until the next morning (hello, Missouri summers) and &#8220;accidentally&#8221; made amazing cookies?  </></>thanks for the article heads-up.  if i didn&#8217;t know how to tap-dance before, i do now.  and my dance is taking me into the kitchen.</p>

      <p>I am also a convert to this recipe! They are totally irresistible. I  made them with the bread flour/cake flour combo but I&#8217;d actually like to try with AP flour to see if there really is a difference. I, too, use the Ghirardelli 60% chips and think they&#8217;re just fine.</></>A few notes: For the first batch I made, I forgot to add the salt. Then I added for 2nd batch. I&#8217;m not actually sure that it&#8217;s necessary &#8211; I might just add a little more salt into the batter which is something I normally do with cookie recipes anyway. I didn&#8217;t love the feel of the salt on my tongue right as I bit in &#8211; prefer it to be more blended in, but that&#8217;s just my take on it.</></>Secondly, I work in catering and I used our professional convection oven for one batch at 325 instead of 350 degrees. (I&#8217;m not a baker, but in sales so still consider myself an amateur!) There was a noticeable difference in the texture from when I baked them in my home oven. The &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; that he mentions where the cookie goes from crunchy to soft was more pronounced in the convection-baked ones and they came out looking more perfect-looking.</></>And you&#8217;re right that the dough needs to come almost to room temp before scooping. I don&#8217;t think it was the best-written recipe &#8211; definitely needed a little refinement, as you have done here.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve had this earmarked and have been talking about making them for a full week now. But as I&#8217;m going through some personal bumps on the road right now, I think it&#8217;ll be a good month before I can cook. It&#8217;s a bit of a hiatus situation &#8211; but hopefully in a month, I&#8217;ll be in a much happier, better place emotionally and back to the cooking world. And I swear, these cookies are what gets made first!</p>

I&#8217;ve got about a quart of frozen Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie dough (your recipe) in the freezer, so it will be a while before I consider whipping up another batch of cookie dough.

      <p>i made these and they are indeed the best chocolate chips cookies ever. i added walnuts and used fancy flake salt, which i think kind of made the whole thing. i did use the chocolate discs, as well, because they have them in bulk at the store by us, and i think they actually did make a difference. with the discs, the chocolate and dough make thin alternating layers throughout and i think make for better texture and more even distribution. that being said, you can&#8217;t go wrong with good ol&#8217; chocolate chips, either.</p>

      <p>These were the star of my weekend.  And it&#8217;s taken some serious self-restraint to keep myself from eating the rest since then.  I&#8217;m trying to restrict myself to baking one cookie per person (and requiring guests to do so!).  </></>I went for the two-flour combination, and used dark muscovado sugar for part because it&#8217;s what I had on hand.

      <p>I read the NY Times article and immediately made plans to make these cookies&#8230; hopefully I&#8217;ll get to it this weekend. But a helpful hint: If you take the dough before you refrigerate it and drop it by teaspoonfuls onto a baking sheet as if you are going to bake the cookies, then you can refrigerate (or freeze it)&#8230; once the dough hardens, scoop the unbaked cookies into a bag, and only bake as many as you want at a time, keeping the rest in the freezer, so you can have fresh, just-out-of-oven cookies any time you get the craving for some.</p>

      <p>Well, I was planning on making dinner, but I think I&#8217;m going to toss that out of the window and just make cookies. As for the hot/warm debate, I love cookies straight out of the freezer most&#8211;all the butter makes them still soft and chewy, but the cold takes away some of the uber richness.</p>

      <p>Molly, I&#8217;ve been reading your blog for&#8230; um&#8230; I think it&#8217;s been about two and a half years now&#8230; wow! and I believe it is finally time to leave a comment.</>I just love it! You have such a nice way of writing&#8230; can&#8217;t wait for each week to begin and read another lovely post!</></>So far, the Chewy Cocoa Cookies with Chocolate Chips have been the all-time favorite around my friends and family. But I believe these cookies will be tough competition.</></>Living in Europe, I treasure my US-measuring cup, but sometimes I still feel the need to convert into the metric system (and if it is only to give the recipe to friends possessing only metric measuring cups&#8230;)</></>Trying out this recipe, I keep wondering why 8 1/2 oz. flour are about 2 cups with the cake flour, but only 1 2/3 cups with the bread flour. Would you be so kind as to explain this to a somewhat lost-in-conversion cookie-aficionado?</p>

      <p>So, if I use A/P flour and have no scale, how many cups would I use?  It looks like the bread flour is heavier than the cake flour so it has a lower cup measure.  How do the 2 flour measurements convert to using A/P?  Or am I just confusing myself?</p>

      <p>I made the cookies last week; they are my favorite recipe.  To be honest, prior to making this recipe, chocolate chip cookies were not my favorite cookie.  I used AP flour, as I didn&#8217;t have any bread flour, and chopped bittersweet chocolate, as I also was unwilling to go out in search of special disks.  Both my husband and myself agree that both the chilling and the salt are key to the success of this recipe.</p>

      <p>The flours: It&#8217;s all got to do with those long-chain proteins! Low-protein flours create that alternate cookie universe, and that &#8220;crumb&#8221; texture that bakers so often talk about (versus the chewy feel of cookies baked using more gluten-rich flours). You can do the same thing for shortbread- just substitute a little rice flour for a portion of the all-purpose flour. You won&#8217;t believe the difference &#8211; almost a melting sensation on the tongue.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m going to have to make these now.  I&#8217;m always searching for the perfect chocolate chip cookie!  I don&#8217;t have cake flour right now, so I&#8217;ll take your word that they will be okay, though I probably will buy some cake flour and make them again sometime to see what the difference is.</></>I think it depends on the cookie, whether it&#8217;s better warm or cooled.  I&#8217;ve made CC cookies before that I liked better the next day, but my most recent CC recipe tasted much better right from the oven.  In general, though, I tend to like most baked goods better after they&#8217;ve been sitting for a little while rather than warm.  The texture and flavors always seem better.</p>

      <p>I am relieved to read that you like your cookies at room temperature. For years, I thought Chips Ahoy were the only kind of chocolate chip cookie I liked. And then I realized you don&#8217;t actually have to eat a homemade cookie the second it comes out of the oven.</></>I&#8217;ve been eager to try this recipe. And now doubly so.</p>

      <p>Umm &#8230; so &#8230; YES.  Heaven.</></>I always want to eat them hot, and I&#8217;m (almost) always disappointed.  Too intense.  And I&#8217;m also with Bess, in that when they come out of the oven, I&#8217;m usually only just recovering from the sugar overload of all the dough I ate.</p>

      <p>I SO cannot eat the hot cookies&#8230;I&#8217;m recovering from my sugar coma caused by eating too much dough. I have always prefered a mix of butter and shortening (ew, gross, I know, but it really works!) for a nice mix of crumb and soft after a day or two. </></>That said, I never bake these in the summer! It&#8217;s berry time, and I&#8217;m getting another half-flat of raspberries tomorrow, which helps make up for my sorrow and the end of strawberry season. </></>If you&#8217;re ever on Whidbey Island over the 4th of July, hit the local grocery stores for THE best strawberries&#8211;they come from Coupeville, are brought in same-day, and sell for about $11/half-flat (I just paid 7 bucks for a quart at the farmers market and they weren&#8217;t anywhere near as fresh or tasty). It&#8217;s just a bit warmer and drier there than here, and the berries have THE best flavor. Ever. Oops, I&#8217;ve slipped back into mourning&#8230;gotta get those raspberries&#8230;</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m raising my hand! I too made cookies, and made tweaks to the recipe (although, I couldn&#8217;t be bothered waiting 36 HOURS!!! for my cookies to chill, I did about an hour, which was torture enough).  Chocolate chip cookies are by far my absolute favorite, and I couldn&#8217;t agree with you more; they are so, so much better when they are room temperature. </></>great post! 🙂</p>

      <p>I made the cookies right after I read your post, but I couldn&#8217;t stand waiting for 36 whole hours after I made the dough to bake them.

      <p>Good<>night<>.  You guys certainly love your chocolate chip cookies!  And I can&#8217;t blame you.</></>We adopted < HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/molly_orangette/2671972845/in/photostream/" REL="nofollow">a dog<> a couple of days ago, so things have been a bit out of the ordinary around here, and I&#8217;m later in replying than I meant to be.  To those of you who had questions about this recipe, so sorry!  I hope you&#8217;ll pardon my delay.</></>Cookofthehouse, I used Maldon sea salt for the tops of the cookies, and it was delicious.  (It&#8217;s also my favorite salt in general.)</></>Angela, yes, I did use an equivalent amount (by weight; not volume) of all-purpose flour.  I used 17 ounces.</></>Hannah, yep, 17 ounces!  Make.  Them.  Lady.</></>Amydawnrose, I wish I&#8217;d had that salad for lunch!  I had a boring salad &#8211; just greens &#8211; and some cherries and banana bread.</></>Barbara, in general, cake flour is lighter (and more finely ground) than bread flour, so it takes more of it to add up to the same weight.</></>Angak, I&#8217;m not 100% sure how many cups of all-purpose flour it takes to add up to 17 ounces &#8211; and it depends, honestly, on how you scoop the flour.  But I just did a Google search, and it seems that you might need about 4 cups (or a little more).</></>Gwen, I use a Salter digital scale that I bought at Williams-Sonoma a few years ago.  I just searched their website for it, and they don&#8217;t seem to carry the same one anymore, but < HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Salter-5-Pound-Microtronic-Kitchen-Scale/dp/B0000YWUY0" REL="nofollow">here<> it is on Amazon.</></>Chasse, if I were you, I think I would do most of this recipe (up to the point of adding the vanilla) with the hand mixer.  Then, to incorporate the flour and chocolate chips, I would stir.</></>Cat, my mixer is a standard one.  When you add the flour, it seems like it&#8217;s going to be too much, but it&#8217;s not, I promise.</></>Though I can&#8217;t respond to everyone else personally, thank you so much for all the kind words.  And for loving cookies.  Seriously.  You are too good.</p>

      <p>Okay, not a chocolate chip cookie fan, in general. But now I am. Darn cookie recipe! They couldn&#8217;t have been more perfect. Worth the wait. But let me tell you, using feves instead of chocolate chips is worth it because they melt into the cookie more, which I think is one of the reasons they are so perfect. And if you have some expensive special chocolate, use it. You wouldn&#8217;t think so, but it really shines through in these cookies.</p>

      <p>Not only did I make them as soon as humanly possible after the recipe was published, not only did I make a special stop for bread flour so I could use both bread and cake, not only do I think they&#8217;re the best chocolate chip cookies ever, but I also used Guittard fancy 72% chocolate disks combined with the Ghiradelli (I couldn&#8217;t make a run down to Jacques Torres for his disks, but I&#8217;m planning to do so).  </></>Excellent dark chocolate that melts into striations in the middle of the cookie &#8212; well, please don&#8217;t take my word for it.

      <p>My employees know me all too well, or at least one does.  I had just read your blog on the NY Times recipe but had just made my son the old yellow bag of Toll House bag recipe, so I was not going to make them again.  Wrong! Then my employee leaves me a photo copy of the Times recipe on my desk with BIG hint, hint written on it.  I am such a sucker, now I have to make them!  I love a crispy chewy chocolate chip cookie and this sounds like heaven.  I will just have to find joy in everyone else loving them!  Thanks!</p>

      <p>dunno if anyone mentioned this yet, but just a thought… why not scoop out and ball the dough first before refrigerating? that way, you’ll just have to plunk it down onto the baking sheet. the dough should be stiff enough to hold its form even if you stack them all in a bowl.</></>while you’re at it, make double or triple batch… after the required refrigeration, stick the rest in a freezer bag and freeze. instant cookies next time you crave some. and having it pre-scooped means you can take out only the number of cookies that you want.</p>

      <p>Molly, so glad you like the cookies. They are entirely addictive. I ate so many in the name of research for the article.</></>The different flours are a way of raising the protein content (along with gluten content) so that the cookies hsve a bit stronger structure snd don&#8217;t spread as much.</></>And if you get a chance, try the couverture chocolate. It melts so differently and adds a lot to the recipe.</></>David Leite</p>

      <p>Here&#8217;s the thing I still don&#8217;t understand about using two flours.  Bread flour has a lot of protein; cake flour has very little protein.  If you use both flours, don&#8217;t they average out into the protein content of AP flour?  By the way, I so agree about eating chocolate chip cookies cold.  COLD, in my case.  We always keep them in the freezer.</p>

      <p>I loved this article, and the clipped recipe is sitting next to me as I type! In terms of the bread and cake flours, I would follow your lead and use all-purpose flour. Bread flour has high gluten, cake flour has low gluten, and all-purpose flour has moderate gluten. I&#8217;ve noticed many modern cookbook authors use a combination of bread and cake flours for recipes that traditionally use all-purpose flour, and I suspect it&#8217;s their way of &#8220;branding&#8221; their own unique recipe by tweaking the traditional ingredients a bit. I personally don&#8217;t think using both cake and bread flours is necessary.</></>In terms of the dough being too hard to scoop, I hear you on that one! A nice solution to this problem is to roll the dough into a log, then cut it into slices directly out of the fridge, foregoing the scoop altogether.</p>

      <p>i gave in and tried the recipe, instead of my usual when my sister wanted to bring some to school. it&#8217;s a wonderful recipe. i let it &#8220;rest&#8221; in the fridge already scooped out and it formed quite well in the oven, cold, right out the fridge. although i wonder if it&#8217;s only me, but i thought it was too sweet. i actually fixed my coffee without sugar today when i had a cookie for my snack.</></>i made two batches though and substituted cocoa for some of the flour and used good sized dark and white chocolate chunks. can&#8217;t ever have too much chocolate!</p>

      <p>You can definitely use all-purpose flour for this recipe. I made this over the weekend and 3 3/4 cups ap flour is the amount you need for this recipe. I would not use the full amount of choc chips this recipe calls for again, way too much for my taste, may be a llittle over a pound. Also, if you are looking for choc chip cookie recipe you don&#8217;t need the dough for try Dorie Greenspan&#8217;s My Best Choc Chip Cookies from her Baking cookbook, that is my go to recipe for choc chip cookies.</></>Jen B</p>

      <p>Thanks for the heads up.  I went to make these, bought the Ghiradelli 60% chips as you did, and then realized that I needed cake and bread flours&#8230;.

      <p>As soon as I read your blog entry, I knew I had to try this recipe for my husband, who adores choc-chip cookies. I didn&#8217;t have high-quality chips on hand (or those chocolate disks), so I bought some Lindt bars (65% Madagascar) and chopped those into small chunks. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, including the mixture of flours.</></>Having skimmed it over the first time, it was a bit of a blow to discover the 36-hour wait time, but we survived. I timed it so they were warm and waiting after le hubby returned from hockey. He, too, declared them the best choc-chip cookies he&#8217;d ever eaten.</></>I&#8217;m not normally a fan of the large bakery choc-chip cookies (I usually find them too sweet), and like you, I&#8217;m a room temperature gal, so I resisted.</></>But not for long. At 6:30 this morning I took a nibble. And then another nibble. </></>One of these cookies, with an ice-cold glass of milk, was an excellent breakfast. And yes, it was also the best chocolate chip cookie I&#8217;ve ever eaten: for the chewiness, and for that hint of salt, which balanced the sweetness perfectly. I&#8217;m in love.</p>

      <p>i had both cake and bread flour, so used them as in original recipe.  used up lots of chocolate odds and ends (60% chips, 60% bar, semi-sweet chips).  added maybe a teaspoon of orange zest.  dough sat in fridge for 2 days before baking.  AMAZING!!!  and so easy when using a scale.  may add some toasted pecans or almonds next time &#8211; there will be many next times&#8230;.</p>

      <p>So I did two batches of these.  One using the cake and bread flours with large couverture disks and the other using AP flour with chip sized couverture.  Both turned out great.  I did have to protect the dough in the fridge from my wife and son, but&#8230;  </></>We we&#8217;re not particularly enraptured with the flavor of the large disks, but those cookies with the other flours seemed to rise a little more.</></>I guess I&#8217;ll just have to try these again with the mixed flours and the smaller chocolate.</></>I did use less of the smaller chocolate.  About 10 &#8211; 12oz.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m wondering if you&#8217;ve gotten over your (needless) dependency on the kitchen-aid mixer, because this might be a good time to do so.  It&#8217;s very easy to stir up this batter with a wooden spoon (I should know cause I&#8217;ve done it three times since you&#8217;ve posted this recipe!) and you don&#8217;t get flour whizzing all over the place.  Thanks for the recipe and keep up the good work!</p>

      <p>Thank you for posting the results with your substitutions. I printed out the recipe to make at a later time, but I wasn&#8217;t sure how important the flours were. They look delicious! I hope being at a high altitude (Denver) doesn&#8217;t mess with them too much.</p>

      <p>Thank you Molly for recapping a most important article. </></>And good, and brave, of you to substitute and play and tell us of your findings.</></>I imagine that something we do in professional kitchens was left out&#8212; the dough was probably <>scooped first and then rested<> for 36 hours so that &#8220;tempering&#8221; the dough the next day and a half would be far easier, and more convenient.</></>If a person has room for this in their home fridge it would mimic the overall process best&#8211; and teach everyone a new trick.

      <p>shuna fish lydon, actually the dough wasn&#8217;t scooped first, but that may have been just for the work Jacques Torres and I did together. I didn&#8217;t see what he or Maury Rubin do on their own.  But it&#8217;s a great idea, if you have the room. I even scoop, freeze, and then vacuum seal the cookies two to a pack. Very convenient.</p>

      <p>As always, another wonderfully written blog post and another recipe that I had to try.  And, yes, the cookies were as deliciously addictive to the adults and toddlers in this house as everyone has shared.  (Though the adults preferred the version with sea salt!)

      <p>Well, we&#8217;re onto our second batch of these cookies in a week. They are outstandingly delicious, and even spurred my youngest child to form a new word (deedee) so that he could request a cookie after his lunch. Who could blame him? </></>Maybe my favorite use of Maldon to date! Hey, for me to crank up the oven twice in one week during a 100+ degree heat wave, they must be good!</p>

      <p>What a wonderful article in the paper, and thank you for leading me to it! Best of all, thank you for adding your substitutions, which worked great for me, who only had the AP flour and chocolate chips in the house.</>So, I made the batter&#8230; but now the waiting is torture!!! I caved in and made a cookie for me and my hubby, smaller than in the recipe, but we just couldnt wait! So far &#8211; so good! I cant wait until they&#8217;ve &#8216;rested&#8217; enough!!</p>

      <p>Molly, I made your recipe for oatmeal cookies last week. I must say, they were the best oatmeal cookies I&#8217;ve ever had, which makes me very excited about this recipe. Just one question &#8211; f I don&#8217;t use a coarse salt, should I reduce the amount (1 1/2 tsp) in the recipe? Or is it really in my best interest to use a coarse salt? It&#8217;s just that I only have table and sea salt on hand at the moment.</></>Thanks!</p>

      <p>Rachel, I&#8217;m so glad you liked the oatmeal cookies!  As for the salt here, yes, if you don&#8217;t have a coarse type, you should probably reduce it a bit.  I&#8217;m not sure how much, but you could try doing a Google search for how to replace kosher salt with table salt.  Or you could just wing it!  </></>E, many recipes call for unsalted butter and then add salt because it&#8217;s more precise.  It&#8217;s hard to quantify the amount of salt in salted butter.</></>JT, we live in Ballard, and we generally buy it at the Safeway at Market and 15th Avenue.</p>

      <p>Rachel, I especially like the fact that the coarse salt does not dissolve completely in the dough, and every now and then you get a bite that is slightly saltier than the rest. Makes the cookies all the more interesting in my eyes.</p>

      <p>I read the article, and it did make me want to try the recipe. Somehow I messed it up and added 3 sticks of butter instead of 2 1/2. They were still very edible, though my husband and I didn&#8217;t like the texture (too crunchy). He took them to work and everyone loved them though. Ugh, I want to experience the amazing chocolate chip cookie described in the article, but it was hard enough to wait for that batch to rest, I don&#8217;t know if I want to try again or just go with my own simpler recipe&#8230;I&#8217;ll let you know if I try again.</p>

      <p>Just as soon as I can bear to turn my oven on, I&#8217;m making these. My grandmother&#8217;s chocolate chip cookies are legendary in our family and the real kicker as far as I&#8217;m concerned is the fact that they had a touch of salt in them which just made your mouth pucker with the anticipation of a gooey, crispy bite. mmm. can&#8217;t wait to try these.</p>

      <p>hi molly,</>i made them!  and i restrained myself for about 30 hours so i was proud 🙂 (i had to make a cobbler to tide myself over, but that&#8217;s another matter&#8230;) and oh my goodness.  they were amazing!  i confess i was a wee bit skeptical at first (could they be THAT good??), but you have made a believer out of me.  they&#8217;ve been unanimously hailed by all who have eaten them as the Best Cookies Ever. 🙂  you are so right about giving them away too&#8230; e + i almost went into a cookie coma before we came to our senses and started bagging them up.</>i will say too that these really might be the most attractive cookies i&#8217;ve made, too, and i love that.  (p.s. i used regular all-purpose flour, and ghiradelli semi-sweet chips, and we just had table salt so that went in too, and all was good)</>thank you!!  XO</p>

      <p>In your picture, the cookies look thick and nice, but mine were really flat and not anything special at all. Did I do something wrong, or is that how they are supposed to be?</p>

      <p>K., I&#8217;m not sure what happened with yours!  They should not be flat, no &#8211; they should be a little on the thick side, actually, with nice crinkles on top.  Hmm.  Could your baking soda or baking powder be old?  That might be the culprit.  Also, how cold was the dough when you baked it?  If the dough isn&#8217;t cool or cold, it could tend to spread more and seem flatter. Just a couple of guesses&#8230;</p>

I am sure that affected the taste a little bit, but all in all, I thought they turned out fab!</></><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26430801@N07/2768598520/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.flickr.com/photos/26430801@N07/2768598520/</a></p>

      <p>Hi Molly!</>I finally got around to making them. They are amazing!</></>Thanks so much for your tips &#8211; they helped a lot!</></>I have to admit, as hard as it is to wait 36 hours to bake those delicious bites of heaven, it makes the cookie-making process somehow easier. It breaks things up into friendlier for the busy person steps: Day one I mix up the dough and then clean that up. Day and a half later, I&#8217;m in the kitchen putting trays in and out of the oven.</p>

      <p>I used bars of ghiradelli chocolate and took a chef&#8217;s knife to basically chop them into very fine slivers. The resulting cookie had the same kind of strata of chocolate as the Jacques Torres cookie and was divine.</p>

      <p>made these several times now &#8211; both with chocolate feves and chips. I have to say I prefer the feves because the chips tend to be too thick and overpower the nice, almost-scone-like texture. a little too chocolatey if there&#8217;s such a thing. But i&#8217;ll still inhale these anytime, whether they were made with feves or chips!</p>

      <p>Yup. Yeah. Yes. You Got It. Right On.</></>I took a couple of months before we could bear to turn the oven on&#8230;but&#8230;This has become the house cookie, replacing the Toll House Cookie recipe from the back of the package. My sister-in-law (we share a house) tested the recipe and we both swooned. She made up a second batch and divided it into quarters and put 3/4&#8217;s in the freezer. We both agree they are best just out of the oven, so we take the dough out, let it thaw briefly and bake just 6 at a time (the only way to restrain ourselves).</p>

      <p>I made these cookies in time for the holidays and received rave reviews! A few friends asked for the recipe (because they can never get their cookies soft) so I shared it. After trying the recipe, one friend had the issue of the cookies spreading out flat and I saw that a few others had commented about that same problem. </></>We were guessing that its due using a gas oven as compared to electric. I used my electric oven and they came out just as depicted. But, the flattening could also be due to the fact that she quadrupled the recipe and possibly a measurement was off? Wanted to share.</></>I also wanted to say that I love your postings, Molly. I&#8217;ve been following for about 2 years but never commented til now. I tend to rely on your tried-and-true recipes all the time and I continuously receive compliments when I use them! Thank you for your intriguing vignettes that surround each recipe, too.</p>

      <p>Thank you so much Molly! These are definitely the best cookies I&#8217;ve ever made, by far. <>Unbelievable.<> </></>I had to bake a couple right away since I was craving cookies so badly, but then I made another batch after 24 hours, and the rest after about 40 hours. It&#8217;s so worth the wait &#8211; the texture and flavour are 100 times better than baking right after you make the dough. </></>I used the yummy dark chocolate disks, which were great, but I think I prefer a ration of about 25 % chocolate 75 % cookie or something like that – more chocolate is too crazy rich for me. I like them best room temp too.</p>

      <p>I made some of these cookies right after I mixed the batter and then some 36 hours later.  The ones made later were better, but not exponentially.  The next time    I think I&#8217;ll go back to my gold standard, Toll House with Callebaut callets, but let the batter sit for 36 hours first.  I suggest you scoop the batter into balls first, then let them sit so you don&#8217;t have to worry about the batter being too hard when you take them out of the fridge.</p>

      <p>These cookies were great. I&#8217;m new to baking and didn&#8217;t have a mixer. Hard to do everything the hard way by hand but it was worth all the effort. =] Guess it is time to invest in a mixer now.</p>

      <p>Molly, I confess. I did a Brandon on these cookies &#8211; I made them using white chocolate since I can&#8217;t eat plian or milk chocolate. They still taste really good though I&#8217;m pleased to report. </></>Thank you for an entertaining blog &#8211; I think I&#8217;ve read your entire blog 3 times now, and each time I find something else to laugh or cry over.</></>Rachel</p>

      <p>I don&#8217;t mean to sound melodramatic, but these cookies have changed my life.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a few tweaks to the original recipe that I think elevate them even further (if that is possible) &#8211; almonds, orange zest and oatmeal.  </p>

      <p>This may be a dumb question, but in regard to the cake flour do you suppose he means non-self-rising or one that has baking soda and salt etc. in it&#8230;likkeeee Presto?</p>

      <p>Hi Anonymous (Mollym forgive me for jumping in),</p>
<p>But for the cookie recipe, it&#39;s plain ole, non-rising cake flour. The recipe already has baking powder and baking soda for leavening.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly,  I was referred here by a friend who said I just had to make these chocolate chip cookies.  Great thing is I have had this recipe in the archive and I guess it&#39;s destiny I finally make them.  </p>
<p>I have also known about you and your blog via another blog that just loves your writing.  Then, when my Bon Appetit issue came there was a lovely article written about flapjacks&#8211;I bought some quick cooking oats just to make them (i&#39;m thinking there the same as these oat bars I had in Canada once&#8211;delish).  </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if someone already commented on the reason the recipe uses two flours; but, since you mentioned your love of Shirley Corriher, I thought I&#39;d let you know why.  She mentions it in her book &#39;Cookwise.&#39; It&#39;s all about the protein levels (low in cake high in bread).  Cake&#39;s low protein doesn&#39;t absorb as much liquid, lending to a a more pale &#038; puffy cookie, because there it leaves more room for steam from the extra liquid.  Bread flour will soak up more liquid creating a darker &#038; crisper cookie.  So my hunch is the combo of the two flours creates this wonderful marriage.  Sorry to get technical with this being my first post, but I wanted to pass on what I learned.  Hope you have a great week.  kamille</p>

      <p>Hello Molly! I baked these cookies yesterday. It seemed like too much to bake the entire batch, so I halved it. I used AP flour, and skipped the chocolate discs. Apart from that, I halved the amount of chocolate chips, and used chopped roasted hazelnuts. The nuts together with the chocolate chips created a &#8220;nutella&#8221; effect, which was incredible. the cookies were absolutely delicious, thank you for another great recipe! ellina</p>

      <p>I was super disappointed with the way my batch of cookies turned out.  I had tried these cookies before that two of my friends had made &#8211; literally the best cookies I have had, sea salt and all, and then when I decided to give it a go &#8211; it was not so good.  My cookies came out flat as a board and I was hoping for the thicker, plumper version.  Did I mix the flour too hard or long, was it my pan, the oven?  I am not sure what to do &#8211; may try them again using a different oven and see what happens &#8211; hope they work!  If you have any tips, then let me know!</p>

      <p>Molly, the first time I made these cookies I found (like you did) that the dough was rock hard and very difficult to scoop out after its long stay in the fridge.</p>
<p>Ever since then, I&#39;ve just scooped out the dough right after mixing it. I then lay the dough balls on a sheet in a single layer, cover the sheet tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 24-36-72 hours. </p>
<p>When it&#39;s time to bake, all I need to do it preheat the oven and arrange the dough balls on the cookie sheet.  It is much easier and more pleasant for me this way!!  Also, the dough stays cool as can be, right up until it goes into the oven.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my <a href="http://cook-snap-repeat.blogspot.com/2010/04/thank-you-for-having-me-over-i-made.html" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on these cookies, if you have a moment to take a peek.</p>

      <p>So&#8230;these are my favorite cookies and I make them all the time. My friends recently threw an engagement party for us and since they aren&#39;t bakers I wanted to make them these cookies. I want to give them some already cooked but wanted to freeze the dough so they could cook them on demand and have cookies for a long time. </p>
<p>What is the best way to freeze? in pre-made balls (which i like the idea of bc i can put the salt on for them) or in a log? Will freezing compromise these cookies?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

      <p>i was reading your recent post (&#8220;i am sold&#8221;) showcasing the whole wheat chocolate chip cookie, when i came across a link to this post adapted from the NY times! i had to make these. so i made some just last night after letting the dough refrigerate for the last 24 hours. amazing! i have never used course sea salt in baking. it works so well with the ingredients in this particular recipe. little &#8220;bursts&#8221; of saltiness are divine! thanks for sharing&#8230;. and now i will have to try the whole wheat version!</p>

      <p>It&#39;s taken me a regrettably long time to finally make these, but indeed, well worth the wait.  I will make one suggestion &#8211; shave down a high quality chocolate bar rather than use chips &#8211; it is delicious and texturally amazing&#8230; you get delicate ribbons of chocolate as well some nice big pockets!  I also added some cocoa nibs &#8211; yum.</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been making these in unreasonable quantities (with the bread flour!) for a while now but last time I made the massive mistake of making them white choc and cranberry chip, rather than bitter choc and didn&#39;t even think to adjust the sugar. So now they&#39;re too sweet. Really achingly sweet, and as a relative beginner, I have no idea what to do with a fridgeful of the dough. </p>
<p>Help anyone?</p>

      <p>Molly- when you make these cookies, do you still just use All Purpose Flour?  If so, is it the same amount (bread flour+cakeflour)?  I would like to make these but would love to avoid running out to buy 2 new flours I don&#39;t often use&#8230;</p>

      <p>Poopie, I apologize for the slow reply!  Yes, I do still use Stone-Buhr all-purpose flour.  It&#39;s slightly lower in gluten than other brands, and I find that it works wonderfully here.  I use 17 ounces of it.  But you can probably get away with any all-purpose flour you have.  My mother-in-law even bakes these cookies with white whole wheat flour.  The texture and flavor are different, but they&#39;re still very good.</p>

      <p>Help! What changes should I make for high altitude baking (6,000 feet)?  I tried the recipe as printed and my cookies were flat &#8211; delicious &#8211; but flat. Also, do you recommend convection oven cooking? Please answer as I&#39;d like to make them again!<br />Thanks,<br />Carol in Sun Valley, Idaho</p>

      <p>Carol! I wish I knew what to tell you, but I sadly know nothing about baking at high altitude.  I am useless!  If I were you, I would do a Google search for some high altitude baking tips or a high altitude chocolate chip cookie recipe to see how it differs from this one. But as for the convection question, I can indeed tell you that yes, I do like the way these cookies turn out with convection.  I&#39;ve baked them in both convection and conventional ovens, and they work in both.</p>

      <p>Holy smokes!  I printed this recipe so long ago but just got around to actually making them this weekend.  These are hands down the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made, and I fancy myself a baker.  The perfect texture, flavor, and chocolatey-ness.  I used the two different flours since I had them in my cupboard and I am a believer. Thank you, thank you!</p>
