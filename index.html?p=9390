    <p>Today, on the ole blog: some thoughts about cooking with a kid! <em>After the jump</em>! Because I totally get that not everyone wants to read about kid stuff!  See you next time!</p>
<p><span id="more-9390"></span><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-9402 size-large" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/F7A6453-1324x883.jpg" alt="_F7A6453" width="1324" height="883" srcset="https://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/F7A6453-1324x883.jpg 1324w, https://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/F7A6453-662x441.jpg 662w, https://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/F7A6453-768x512.jpg 768w, https://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/F7A6453-870x580.jpg 870w" sizes="(max-width: 1324px) 100vw, 1324px" /></p>
<p>June started school last fall, and we enrolled her in a <a href="http://amshq.org/Montessori-Education/Introduction-to-Montessori" target="_blank">Montessori</a> school. I went to <a href="https://www.westminsterschool.org/" target="_blank">a Montessori-influenced school</a>, myself, from preschool through middle school, and Brandon once spent a year teaching music in a Montessori school, and without going into a whole bunch of educational philosophy that I only vaguely follow and that, as a result, makes me really sleepy, I will just say that I loved the Montessori method as a student, and that it makes a lot of sense to us as parents. (Let&#8217;s ignore, for now, the fact that I will possibly never be accustomed to thinking of myself as a Parent.) Despite my lifelong tendency to overthink everything, I have always had a weird, vaguely witchy, but very welcome sense that June <em>will be okay in life</em>, whatever we do. And so, when a number of friends and acquaintances recommended this particular school, Brandon and I crossed our fingers and, without much more than that, decided to go for it.</p>
<p>In any case, parents are required to spend a handful of hours volunteering at this school. And recently, as I spent an hour helping a gaggle of preschoolers prepare berry shortcake for a tea party, I was struck by how <em>capable</em> these small humans are, able to slice the stems from strawberries and wash slippery dishware with great care, even as they also wipe their noses on their sleeves and sneak berries from the bowl because it&#8217;s reeeeeeeeally hard to wait. June is essentially growing up in a restaurant, and cooking at home is a daily thing, but we are regular mortal parents, not Superparents: we don&#8217;t often involve her in the actual preparation of meals, because cooking with a three-year-old is not Supereasy, and because of the nose on the sleeve, the whole hard-to-wait thing, the FEMA-level cleanup effort. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/5TCgsEOD9p/?taken-by=mollyorangette" target="_blank">Last summer</a>, she and I made <a href="http://orangette.net/2010/08/but-then/" target="_blank">cobbler</a> together, and she&#8217;s good at cracking eggs, and she and Brandon have even made pizza together. But given how often we prepare food at home, how <em>normal</em> it is in our household, well, in the grand scheme of things, we do not often cook with our kid. And I came home from my volunteer shift feeling itchy to change that. I came home with a different sense of possibility, a renewed appreciation for the practical education of everyday life, and a gut feeling that June can do more than we have been asking of her &#8211; and that she wants to.</p>
<p>This past Wednesday morning, we had another little girl and her mom over, and the four of us made cookies. This is not something I usually do in the middle of the week, I should clarify, but since it&#8217;s June&#8217;s mid-winter break, and since Brandon is working long hours on <a href="http://dinostomatopie.com" target="_blank">Dino&#8217;s</a> (opening within the month!) and we are short on childcare and I am trying to keep June and myself productively occupied so one or both of us doesn&#8217;t start yelling and/or crying, making cookies with friends seemed like a good way to pass a morning. And it was. As I was cleaning up afterward and reveling in the holy quiet that is nap time, I realized that the morning had gone well, in part, because June and I went into it with a certain amount of trust, structure, and preparation. And I decided to sit down and write a small list of the things I know about cooking with a young child, before I forget them all.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-9461 size-large" src="http://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/F7A6447-2-1324x883.jpg" alt="_F7A6447-2" width="1324" height="883" srcset="https://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/F7A6447-2-1324x883.jpg 1324w, https://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/F7A6447-2-662x441.jpg 662w, https://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/F7A6447-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://orangette.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/F7A6447-2-870x580.jpg 870w" sizes="(max-width: 1324px) 100vw, 1324px" /></p>
<p>Number 1! I try, I really try, not to fetishize food or cooking. Food is an extremely pleasurable, nourishing part of life, and we get to share it with people: that&#8217;s <em>amazing</em>. But food is also a very normal, everyday thing, like sleeping, reading, and taking a walk. I don&#8217;t want her to think that food is something to be worshipped &#8211; or, conversely, loathed. And I know that the more excited I seem about something, and the more I am totally drooling all over myself to get her excited about it too, the less excited she will be. I try to play it cool.</p>
<p>2. A small, easy-to-move stool is essential. Or, if not a stool, a small, sturdy, kid-size chair that you don&#8217;t mind someone standing on. June pulls a small chair up to the counter to work beside me, to wash her hands at the sink, to do everything.</p>
<p>3. Lots of dish towels!  I don&#8217;t care about spills, and I don&#8217;t care if my dish towels get stained or burned or torn, because I have lots and lots of them. (And as they get dirty, June gets to chuck them down &#8220;the laundry chute,&#8221; aka the stairs to our dungeon/first-floor-that-feels-like-a-basement.)</p>
<p>4. A couple of months ago, June came home from a visit to my mom&#8217;s house and suddenly, magically, knew how to crack an egg. THANK YOU, MOM! I would have never thought to teach her that. Turns out, three-year-olds are not only capable of cracking an egg, but they are INTO it, too. And if and when she gets a splinter of eggshell in the bowl, I just use part of the shell to scoop it out. (Or, if it&#8217;s too late to fish it out and the egg is already in the frying pan, Brandon and I have learned to, um, just take a big bite of egg, don&#8217;t chew too much, and swallow quickly.)</p>
<p>5. Do not cook or bake with a child when you are feeling cranky or in a hurry or are not willing to be pummeled with questions about everything. Actually maybe do not have a child if you are feeling cranky or in a hurry or are not willing to be pummeled with questions about everything.</p>
<p>6. Do not cook or bake with a child if you don&#8217;t want the kitchen to get dirty. Ha ha haaaaaaaaaa, oh man.</p>
<p>7. Measure and prep ingredients ahead of time, if at all possible, so that the child&#8217;s tasks are limited to stirring / dumping things from bowl to bowl / washing / things you want them to do / things they can do successfully.</p>
<p>8. Kids can cut up soft fruits and vegetables! Montessori <a href="http://www.montessoriservices.com/vegetable-chopper-with-wooden-handle" target="_blank">knives</a> and <a href="http://www.montessoriservices.com/practical-life/food-preparation/cutting-slicing/wavy-chopper" target="_blank">choppers</a> are great, though I haven&#8217;t yet bought any for home. We mostly use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FUO3QM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000FUO3QM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=YT3EESGEHZFCS4MW" target="_blank">partially serrated butter knife</a>.</p>
<p>9. Kids can wash dishes, if you show them how. And while June is not quite yet able to wash dishes <em>well</em>, she will be within the next six months to a year. (She&#8217;s 3½.)</p>
<p>10. Kids can set the table. June sets ours every night, taking the correct number of forks from the drawer and the correct number of napkins from the bowl and putting them (approximately) at our usual seats at the table. (Though she does like to &#8220;hide&#8221; the utensils inside the folded-up napkin because it&#8217;s so, so, sooooo funny.)</p>
<p>11. Kids can peel hard-boiled eggs, bananas, and clementines and mandarins, if you show them how. And they can serve others, counting out individual pieces of fruit or vegetables and making sure everyone gets the right amount.</p>
<p>12. When June was just old enough to stand on a chair without my worrying about her falling, I used to stand her next to me at the counter while I chopped vegetables for soup. And as I chopped them, I would slide them in front of her, and her job was then to put them into a bowl. That was fun for a long time, by which I mean five minutes. Still. These days, she can take it a step further, stirring olive oil into a bowl of vegetables for roasting and helping to distribute them on the pan.</p>
<p>13. Kids can spread butter or jam on toast. They can put frosting on cookies and cakes. June can make her own peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich. This all takes an investment of time up front &#8211; the first couple of times, June wanted to put the entire jar of jam on her sandwich &#8211; but now she&#8217;s made her own sandwich a half-dozen times, with only a minimum of (covert, across-the-room) attention on my part. And she&#8217;s so proud.</p>
<p>And, finally, 14. I ask myself this all the time, in every aspect of life: <em>what is the worst that could happen</em>? What is the worst thing that could happen if I let June make her own peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich?  She could, in fact, put the entire jar of jam on the sandwich. But really, so what? I actually don&#8217;t care very much. We will both (probably) survive it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcU0qbV70rU" target="_blank">My heart will go on</a>. She&#8217;ll eat less jam tomorrow. Really, what is the worst that could happen? She makes a mess, for sure. That&#8217;s usually all. And unless the food I&#8217;m making with her is ready-to-eat &#8211; like a salad, or a sandwich &#8211; any germs will be cooked to death. The stakes are, in most things, much lower than we think.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got. That, and the recipe for Jimmy&#8217;s Pink Cookies from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416551069/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1416551069&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=orangette-20&amp;linkId=4JKIGSQKC3WQGNF7" target="_blank">A Homemade Life</a></em>, the recipe we made on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking around. x</p>

    <p>I made the dough first thing on Wednesday morning, while June was watching <em>Daniel Tiger</em> &#8211; real talk &#8211; and it was ready to roll out an hour later, when our friends arrived. I <em>highly</em> recommend making the dough ahead, since waiting for dough to chill is not easy for kids. And if you can, go ahead and measure out the frosting ingredients while you&#8217;re doing the dough.</p>
<p>Once we were ready to get started, I took charge of rolling out the dough, and then the girls went to work with their chosen cookie cutters. (The original recipe below calls for using round cookie cutters, but we used alphabet shapes.) I helped ease the dough shapes from the cutters onto the baking sheet, and I rerolled the dough scraps as needed. But mostly, I let them do their thing. While the cookies baked and cooled, June helped me beat up the frosting, and then each kid got a small knife and their own bowl of frosting for spreading on the finished cookies.</p>

      <div class="recipe-list">
              <h3>For the cookies:
</h3>                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 ½ sticks (170 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            ½ cup powdered sugar, sifted
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 ½ cups (210 grams) all-purpose flour
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
          </div>
                      <h3>For the frosting:
</h3>                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            4 ounces (112 grams) cream cheese, at room temperature
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            3 tablespoons (42 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 ½ cups powdered sugar, sifted
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            ¾ teaspoon kirsch, or more to taste, or a half-capful of cherry extract
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            Red food coloring (optional, but the frosting won't be pink without it)          </div>
                  </div>
  
      <div itemprop="instructions">
      <p>To make the cookies, combine the butter and powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat, first on low speed and then slowly increasing to medium, until light and fluffy. Scrape down the side of the bowl as needed.</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk the flour and salt. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, beating until the flour is just absorbed. Add the vanilla, and beat well to incorporate. Lay a sheet of plastic wrap on the countertop, and turn the dough out onto it. Gather the dough into a ball, and press it into a thin, smooth disk. Wrap well, and refrigerate for one hour.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment.</p>
<p>On a clean, lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a thickness of about 3/8 inch. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into any shape you like. (My friend Jimmy uses a heart-shaped cutter when he makes these cookies; I usually use a 2 ½-inch circle.)</p>
<p>Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 1 ½ inches apart. Bake them one sheet at a time, keeping the second sheet in the fridge until the first is done, for about 16 minutes, or until the cookies look set and are just pale golden at the edge. Do not allow them to brown. Transfer the pan to a wire rack, and allow the cookies to cool completely on the pan. Repeat.</p>
<p>To make the frosting, put the cream cheese and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, and beat on medium speed until smooth. Add the powdered sugar, and beat on low speed to incorporate. Then raise the speed to medium, and beat until there are no lumps, scraping down the side of the bowl as needed. Add the kirsch and a couple of drops of food coloring, and beat well.  The frosting should be pale pink, ideally, though June wanted it darker than that, so we added some more coloring. Spread the frosting generously &#8211; this is key! lots of frosting! &#8211; onto the fully cooled cookies.</p>
<p>Stored in an airtight container, the frosted cookies will keep in the fridge for a few days, and they&#8217;re delicious cold. You can also freeze them.</p>
    </div>

      <p>Love this post and cooking with my 3.5 year old, too.  She&#8217;s really good at making salad, specifically tearing lettuce and chopping avocado (she uses a dull cheese knife).  So great!  She&#8217;s also really good at evenly distributing pizza toppings.  She has put about half a jar of jam on her pb&amp;j.  I agree &#8211; not so big a deal 🙂</p>

      <p>I grew up in a working kitchen as well.  It started with  cutting orders of toast, tearing lettuce (so much lettuce) and mixing ginormous bowls of really cold meatloaf ingredients.  My mother passed while I was still young and those are some of my best memories; our family working together preparing good food.</p>

      <p>When my daughter (now almost 11) was about June&#8217;s age, one of our favorite things to make together was banana bread (or, more frequently, chocolate chip banana bread, because yum). Mashing the bananas was an excellent kid-friendly task, low risk, and while she was doing that I could start gathering and measuring other ingredients. Obviously she&#8217;s able to do quite a bit more now, and when we bake together these days we spend a lot of time talking about fractions!</p>

      <p>I like this list very much. Number 14 especially. We recently lost nearly a whole jar of jam in a very well sweetened bowl of yogurt and a week before that, on a very jammy jam and butter sandwich. (We still aren&#8217;t sure about the physics there – I mean, how much jam can really fit on a single piece of toast?) One thing from my own list is have a butcher tray handy – it contains everything from sprinkles to seeds beautifully, and saves at least *some* of them from the floor (also good for glitter).</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve just gotten brave enough to start cooking with my 21-month-old. She can whisk eggs, dump measured ingredients, and stir like a champ. The tough part is convincing her to give up the bowl when her job is done. I love incorporating her and she loves to help. She pretends to cook &#8220;hot beans&#8221; and eggs all the time, too. Thanks for giving me ideas for how to level up her involvement when she&#8217;s older!</p>

      <p>Great ideas! I have 3 sons and we are just getting the boys back into the kitchen. With my oldest we cooked together a lot. My younger two are very close in age and cooking became some sort of look-at-me competition with too many toddler crashes and a burnt elbow! Finally we are at a point where jobs can be assigned (taste testers included!) and it&#8217;s fun, and safe, again! I really enjoy the time with them and feel like they will benefit from their experiences. I love seeing how proud they are when they serve our family something they made!</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m glad to hear this &#8211; I too cooked a lot with my oldest when she was 1.5-2.5yo, but when baby #2 stopped napping so much it got much harder, and then as he got more interested in helping himself it just became a gong show with me trying to pay attention to too many things at once. We now have baby #3 and I&#8217;m wondering if I&#8217;m ever going to get to cook with them, since I&#8217;ve learned that one-on-one is much much better for my sanity and for the kids too!</p>

      <p>when making christmas cookies with my 3 year old i almost lost it and my husband was a bit worried&#8230;just vision her fitting maybe 3 cookies in a large rolled out cookie dough because she likes to space them so and both me and her yelling at each other for control on how we do it. what saves me now is when we did valentine&#8217;s day cookies is i gave her a hunk of cookie dough and with her little rolling pin i let her have at it all the while doing the bulk myself. i also sometimes just make the cookies ahead of time and then just have her frost and decorate them.  life can be so hard with kids, but unimaginable without them.</p>

      <p>As a mother of 3 grown daughters, I love that you are cooking with June. Most of all I love that you don&#8217;t worry about the mess and just enjoy the moment. This time spent cooking and enjoying it, will repay you in spades. My oldest daughter lives across the country in Sydney now and we have great calls from the supermarket  or in her lunch hour talking about what she is cooking or how to make a childhood favourite. We all still laugh about the cooking adventures as  one daughter calls them. But the big winner from this era was &#8220;The Toddler Plate&#8221;&#8230;. or a tasting plate. Just raid the fridge, the pantry and the fruit bowl and choose what they wanted to eat . Cut up and arrange on plates, kept them busy for ages and they ate it all as they had chosen and made it. Great for fussy kids. We still whip up a toddlers plate after a busy day, albeit more olives and cheese and the addition of wine! The mention of June learning to crack eggs with your Mum was lovely to hear.</p>

      <p>I love this too! I have a four and a half year old and a two year old, we have a learning tower they both fit in to help me out.  I&#8217;m always feeling like I don&#8217;t give them enough tasks to help! My four year old can chop onions and garlic in a food processor. She also knows my recipe for tomato sauce and recently surprised me by making meatballs with me including mixing and shaping. It&#8217;s work, but really rewarding work. If they can&#8217;t really help, I just put a few dishes out and some berries that they can sort and eat.</p>

      <p>The learning tower&#8211;a kitchen godsend! For a while, I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to spend &#8220;quality&#8221; time with my 18 mo, after a hectic day at work while trying to get dinner on the table. That beast of a learning tower  and some nylon knives saved most meals and half my sanity. French toast is a favorite to make on weekends; something about the dipping in the eggs and the spatula and toddler hands. Thanks, Molly, for this awesome post and reminder to keep pressing on, flour lacquering every surface be damned!</p>

      <p>I feel exactly the same way about food and cooking with kids. My son (now 17) loved to cook as a kid. For his 4th birthday party, all he wanted were cooking ingredients, so that&#8217;s what kids brought &#8212; flour, grains, herbs, veggies fruit, nuts, olive oil, olives &amp; pickles (his favorites), etc.  Then the kids proceeded to cook, or at least treat it all like a cool science experiment. I cobbled together an outdoor kitchen in the yard.  (Clean-up accomplished with a hose. Even more fun!  These are 4-year olds, remember?)  Some of the &#8220;food&#8221; was edible, some not, but everyone tried at least a bite of each concoction. And they had a blast.  </p>
<p>To this day my son loves everything about food and eats well. He doesn&#8217;t have much time to cook, but food will always be a cherished part of his life.</p>

      <p>I love cooking with my kids! I mean not all the time because that&#8217;s insane, but I love that they&#8217;re getting a good base. I never want our kitchen to be seen as some intimidating place where you could ruin something. I have noticed that having 3 kids I need to make a special effort to include them one at a time and to respect their differing levels of confidence (they&#8217;re 1.5, 6, and 9).  </p>
<p>Also it is sometimes difficult to remember that the kid who cannot seem to remember how to get ready for bed without reminders is the same one who can whip up a batch of pancakes and bring me coffee in bed 😉</p>

      <p>Making cookies with you Mom is the best! I just turned 49 and baked for the 48th consecutive year-Christmas cookies with my 70 yr old Mom, my little sister (40+) , her 3 yr old little girl, my little brother (35+) and his 13 yr old twin boys and 11 yr old daughter.  My Aunts and their kids and grandkids sometimes join us along with neighboring kiddos.  It is controlled chaos many spilled sprinkles but a favorite tradition that has been the gateway to shared cooking.  Kids can do it and many times better than the adults. Loved this!</p>

      <p>I love this. When my daughter was small, she was in charge of crepes and vinaigrettes. a little jar with a tight-fitting lid, and the ingredients where she could access them (and we went through tons of balsamic vinegar, since she&#8217;d consume it  nonstop). she&#8217;s still in charge, at 13, of our vinaigrettes, and they still taste amazing.  Kids can do WAY more than we think. YAY JUNE!</p>

      <p>My kids are 8 and 5 and they are in charge of dinner one night (we usually do every other week, definitely on a slow night). They love searching the Internet for recipes, crossing off their list at the market, and they think it&#8217;s hilarious to switch jobs with the adults (i.e.: mom and dad set the table and clear the dishes). It&#8217;s amazing to see them scurry around the kitchen and proudly present their &#8220;masterpiece.&#8221;  And I shouldn&#8217;t even use quotes because they truly are masterpieces!</p>

      <p>As a single parent, I find that cooking with my not-quite-2-year-old is easier than NOT cooking with him and having him vie for my attention. I never have time to do the measuring ahead, but he&#8217;s pretty patient about waiting his turn to dump things in the bowl (except eggs, which are too exciting to wait for). A friend recently shared a picture of her 6 year old making eggs-in-a-nest for he and his sisters; all mom had to do was turn on the stove. It really is amazing what these small people are capable of if we give them a chance! And seeing their growing confidence and knowing they&#8217;ll be able to feed themselves well makes up for any messes.</p>

      <p>My mum used to make fruit cakes and my job was to mix the dried fruit into the dry ingredients. My fat little fingers would get lost in the bowl of flour separating the sultanas and raisins and things. Best kid entertainment ever! For my own kids I would figure out similar mixing opportunities like mixing the blueberries into the dry ingredients for blueberry muffins &#8211; it always gave me enough time to throw together the wet ingredients. But my biggest discovery was the egg slicer! I could get home from work, wipe off a few mushrooms and within seconds I had bought myself at least 10 minutes of bemused toddler entertainment while I whipped out most of dinner. That and the plastic knife and a few strawberries or bananas to slice up. Bliss 🙂   Oh, wait a minute&#8230;. what about those fun-filled times of both kids doing blind fold taste tests? Can you tell the difference between an orange or a yellow pepper? Pop on a blind fold and test your accuracy! There! Another 10 minutes of getting more dinner on the table 🙂</p>

      <p>This is great, Molly (I love your blog and books too by the way!) especially the advice on not fetishising food/cooking and not making it the enemy either, just making it normal. I wanted to ask a question about whether you manage to all eat as a family every night, what time you eat, is it sometimes just you and June, does she need to eat early and Brandon and you later? I only ask because I&#8217;ve grappled with this a lot over the years &#8211; my kids are now 12 and 8 but the 8 year old wants to eat early (latest 6), my 12 year old son eats kind of constantly but prefers to eat with my husband and myself but my husband gets home later (very erratic hours in film and television, almost as bad as the restaurant industry I suspect) and as a couple we used to eat around 8pm or later.  Also I had great intentions to always eat at a well-set table and did when the kids were smaller or when I was pregnant with my second and happy to adopt a kid-mealtime routine as I was so exhausted (and not drinking wine!) but as the years have gone by it&#8217;s slightly fallen apart with lots of TV suppers (albeit home-cooked ones) partly because my husband wants to just crash when he gets home from work. I&#8217;m trying hard to get back to a better dinnertime routine (it&#8217;s compounded also by increased fussiness from two kids who ate anything when they were June&#8217;s age&#8230;&#8230;grrrrrr) but I don&#8217;t know what time to set it at  and was interested how others managed.</p>

      <p>For us, it&#8217;s kind of a work in progress.  Brandon has been working mostly in the daytime for the past several months, as he prepares to open Dino&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s meant that we all get to eat dinner together most of the time. We usually eat between 6 and 7, and I let June have a snack beforehand to tide her over. And dinner is often really simple stuff: a soup I made over the weekend, rice from the rice cooker with whatever greens are in the fridge and a fried egg on top and nuoc cham, or fried rice, or scrambled eggs and whatever (carrot sticks dipped in vinaigrette is a crowd-pleaser here). But when Brandon is working at night, it&#8217;s sort of a toss-up. About half the time, I feed June, put her to bed, and then eat on my own. Or I take her to Delancey! We have an easy out, for better or for worse&#8230;</p>
<p>In any case, I think you&#8217;re doing a fantastic job. It sounds like you do manage to eat together quite a bit, and to cook at home, despite being busy!  Your kids are very lucky.</p>

      <p>I don&#8217;t have kids, Molly, but as someone who has worked with inpatients (&amp; outpatients) with eating disorders, I&#8217;d like to send you a big hug! You&#8217;re giving June a solid foundation to having an overall, healthy relationship with food.  And if I hadn&#8217;t read your entire post, I never would&#8217;ve seen the Montessori cutting devices. How cool!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right about how children can resist things their parents do well themselves and want them to like (for me, knitting caused a bit of friction). I remember my mom was adamant that we eat well-done beef, eschewing anything with even the slightest pinkness; and eat parsnips and radishes as often as possible. I DO eat thinly sliced radishes with butter and salt on good bread, but not the other two. I doubt that you&#8217;d ever make your child eat beef that tasted like a mouthful of cardboard!</p>

      <p>Love this post and hearing about cooking with June. My 4 -year-old is obsessed with dogs and loves cooking. So we make people-grade dog treats (flax, wheat germ, ww flour, eggs) which taste a lot like regular people crackers. Everyone can eat them and it doesn&#8217;t matter how they look!

      <p>Also kids are great at making granola!  They add the dry ingredients (oats, sesame seeds, nuts, bit of flour, raisins, wheat germ, coconut etc etc etc) in a giant bowl and I appropriately balance w oil and maple syrup, they give it a good stir and onto a sheet to the oven.

      <p>Thanks for this Molly, it&#8217;s great and so true. I often stop myself and ask &#8216;what&#8217;s the worse that could happen?&#8217; as my daughter does things for herself in the kitchen. Plus, we have a dog to hoover things up.</p>
<p>Juliette is two and a bit and loves to shake spices over chopped soon to be baked vegetables. She&#8217;s also really good at breaking down a head of washed cauliflower &#8211; we make your roasted cauliflower and onion thing every couple of weeks 🙂</p>

      <p>Lovely post.  I wish I had cooked more with my daughter when she was June&#8217;s age.    So often I was too lazy and just wanted to &#8220;get it done.&#8221;  So it is a mystery to me where her cooking skills actually came from when now, at 14, she made Christmas dinner pretty much all by herself (I did some advising on the pie).  Did she just get them by osmosis?  Did she learn more in home ec. (though they don&#8217;t call it that anymore) than I realized?  Anyhow, I was proud.  The dinner was good.  She made pork tenderloin, sweet potatoes, kale, and cranberries, with pumpkin pie.  Her menu.  Simple but really nice.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly,<br />
I just wanted to add that I have my son, and his nieces before him, measure everything. It&#8217;s messy but it really helps as a tangible math lesson. I definitely step in and help as needed but they&#8217;ve all loved it. (I also have them measure over a baking sheet and nothing is added to the bowl until I&#8217;ve adjusted as needed!)</p>

      <p>Cooking with my kids (6 and 3.5) is one of my favorite things to do. My older son got a subscription to Raddish Kids for his birthday and I can&#8217;t even talk about how much I love it. The recipe cards are laid out perfectly for new readers &#8211; with pictures and simple words and instructions &#8211; and so far every recipe has been one he can execute with a teeny bit of help lifting/putting in and out of the oven from me. His little brother is becoming quite the eqq cracker and whisker. Oh and I followed Matthew&#8217;s advice from Hungry Monkey and they both have their own paring knives (I think the same brand, even!) and they love them. Thanks for sharing!</p>

      <p>As we got older, we got put in charge of dinner one night a week, but my parents made the caveat that one of the things had to be something new &#8211; that we had not cooked/eaten at home.  It broadened our horizons and made us more adventurous, and we found a few new favorite dishes!</p>

      <p>I love this post, well I love them all but this one rang very true.  As our son is close to turning three,  he too loves being in the kitchen with me, almost daily.  I love your list on how to bake/cook with child.  I for one have been there when I was  not in the best of moods and our &#8220;baking together&#8221; ended on a sour note.  Mainly me feeling sour and embarrassed for how I acted.  Lesson learned.  I love what you wrote as well about June making herself her sandwich, so very true what is the worst that could happen?  Awesome post to remember to breathe and enjoy the memories that you and  June will cherish a lifetime.</p>

      <p>Would you be willing to share what Montessori June attends? (You can email me if sharing that publicly is weird ). We are moving to Seattle from the Bay Area and I&#8217;ve called every Montessori in North Seattle for my three year old. We love Montessori and hope to find a good one  in Seattle.</p>

      <p>What kids are also really good at is licking the beaters 🙂 Leonie is pretty much June&#8217;s age (*11/12) and she LOVES to &#8216;help&#8217; me cook or bake. Some of her faves are:<br />
&#8211; sifting flour<br />
-pouring or adding anything I measure out for her to a bowl or pot<br />
-telling me what the scales say (&#8216;twelvety kilos!!&#8217;)<br />
-mixing/stirring<br />
-KNEADING DOUGH<br />
-shaping dough<br />
I haven&#8217;t tried the egg cracking yet with her. Wish me luck!</p>

      <p>What a sweet post &#8211; I hope it encourages LOADS of people to cook with their littles!  Mine all did some of that when they were that age &#8211; only one really enjoys it still [one avoids at all costs, one will cook her own messes but otherwise not so much].  And the egg cracking thing was so funny &#8211; it was a messy transition here LOL &#8211; but  just one afternoon &#8211; and then she became the official egg cracker of the household &#8211; still loves it and she&#8217;s 13 &#8211; satisfying and magical somehow.<br />
The advice for prep is right on too [I&#8217;d add in that if you ARE partial to tidiness &#8211; I&#8217;m not &#8211; but as you progress a cookie sheet under a child&#8217;s work area can make for super easy clean up &#8211; say when it&#8217;s time to decorate cookies with sprinkles &#8211; ahem]<br />
My little chef now does her own mise when she is going to do something solo which I love as it encourages her to either completely read through or think through the recipe before starting &#8211; since that&#8217;s been an issue for her [insert eye roll and pictures of cakes with big holes et al here]</p>

      <p>Thank you for this post. It is wonderful hearing another parent &#8220;be real&#8221; and admit that sometimes yelling and crying do happen and sometimes you do have to turn that tv on to get a few things done (no shaming!). I&#8217;m excited to teach my son how to bake/cook when he is a little older &#8211; he isn&#8217;t quite 2 yet, so the tips were great.</p>

Thank you for posting about cooking with a kid.  I have a 6 month old who loves to be in the kitchen with me, I feel like it will be the norm when he gets older as well.  I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how to do toddlerhood and beyond and make him interested in food.<br />
Right now I wear him on my back and talk to him the whole time, so that I feel like he is interacting.  I will take this post to heart and save it for when he&#8217;s a little older!<br />
Thank you again!</p>

      <p>I started cooking with my boys when they were old enough to stand on a chair, too.  A resounding yes to all the suggestions on your list  except I still really hate allowing my 5 y.o. to crack eggs, and I limit his jam usage by apportioning out a tablespoon, or so, into a small bowl from whence he can apply his jam&#8230; or not apply it, as is the case on days he prefers a deconstructed sandwich (i.e. eating first the jam, then the peanut butter and then finally the bread).</p>
<p>Also, my one of my favorite tools for rolling out cookies with my children has been a rolling pin with rings on the ends to keep consistent thickness for the rolled out dough.  I have a pin with wooden rings but, in case you&#8217;re interested, these ones do exactly the same job <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evendough-rolling-pin-bands-sets/dp/B004QP5EME/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.amazon.com/Evendough-rolling-pin-bands-sets/dp/B004QP5EME/</a></p>

      <p>My mother liked to tell the story about how her mother and father both worked and so she was responsible for preparing the family dinner from the age of 5.  She made the same thing every night &#8211; hamburger steaks, fried potatoes and iceberg lettuce with mayonnaise dressing.   she pulled her little stool around from the sink to the stove etc. Her mother&#8217;s shop was attached to house so its not as if help was far away, but it is amazing to me just how much kids are capable of when taught.</p>

      <p>I can count on half a hand the number of times I&#8217;ve commented on a blog post but I feel compelled to say YES! YES! YES! I have two girls, 19 and 23, and while I did a perfectly lovely job as a parent in oh so many ways, I was a bit too uptight to share the kitchen much with them. They&#8217;re pretty great young people and I don&#8217;t think this will necessarily be the piece that lands them in therapy if there is any piece that does at any point land them in therapy. But everything you describe sounds so lovely it makes me long (just a little, ha) to go back and get a do-over on this piece. Thanks for writing this.</p>

      <p>Love this, Molly. June is such a doll. Mimi is 3 1/3 years. Mostly she stands on a stool at the sink and asks if she can &#8220;stir.&#8221; I give her a huge bowl, she fills it with water, grabs a ladle (?), and asks for a piece or two of everything I am cutting/peeling/chopping, etc. (onion skins, carrot tops, garlic skins, celery leaves) and stirs it all vigorously, adding soap, milk, old orange juice from her sippy cup, raisins, dog food. . . . :))) She&#8217;s gong to Waldorf preschool next year. I think they&#8217;ll have her cooking more than I do  (if only dinner-making didn&#8217;t come at the end of the daaaaaaaay, when I just want to sit doooooooown) so I&#8217;ll need to step up my game. Thanks for the encouragement. (By the way, I was begging Andrea for her granola recipe and she pointed me toward Granola #5 and oh, my, stars, thank you for that, too! The best.)</p>

      <p>&#8220;&#8230;reveling in the holy quiet that is nap time&#8230;&#8221; Oh, yeah, you&#8217;re definitely a parent.  My kids are a teen and ten now, and our kitchen is always the one used for baking parties. There&#8217;s something about a kitchen full of fabulously sweet, brainy, awkward, beautiful young women baking cookies while they plot to take over the world with fabulous academic futures and careers that makes my heart happy. They even clean up after they create now, although I&#8217;d love having them even if they left flour glue all over the counters like they did when they were younger. Baking has always been a thing for us&#8211;but I realized how much I&#8217;ve failed in teaching the kids daily cooking. My 14-year-old daughter, who is taking all college courses, asked our son this weekend how to work the toaster. I&#8217;m ashamed of myself. Time for life lessons! June has far more survival skills than my girl! 😉</p>

      <p>We LOVE Pretend Soup! I actually pull it out whenever I am making popovers. This was a big hit with my daughters early on. Also want to suggest you let kids shake salad dressing in a jar with the lid closed, use the salad spinner, make cream into whipped cream in a jar, etc. Things that they can do to help that also tire them out is like double-awesome.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m childless, but I do have a 2 1/2 year old niece who spends a good chunk of time with me. She loves helping in the kitchen, and the moment she sees me taking out the chopping board, she runs to get her small chair. She&#8217;s a fan of sprinkling herbs on anything (I&#8217;ve learnt to keep salt away from her!), stirring and mostly anything I let her do. One tip I think it&#8217;s necessary with such a small child is to use your biggest bowl if you don&#8217;t want everything to end up on the floor. I&#8217;ve also found that she&#8217;s more likely to try something new when she&#8217;s helped made it. And working on my patience is never a bad thing :).</p>

      <p>Enjoyed this post alot even though my babies are now 30 and 32! 😉 But I loved to have them in the kitchen with me when they were young. It was always worth it. And I seriously had a goal that they be exposed to a good variety of food, that cooking be an act of love, and someday that they&#8217;d be capable cooks for themselves and those they love. And that all happened! It is so gratifying (and yes, enjoyable!) to sit down to a meal they prepared. And now a 5yo grandgirl is in the mix, and we encourage her to participate as much as she wants. It&#8217;s a good thing. 😉</p>

      <p>Love this, Molly. I&#8217;m just going to tuck this list away for if/when I have little ones of my own 😉  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s timely for me, too, despite my non-parental status as I&#8217;m just now working on a blog post for next week, writing about my very first experience with recipe writing and cooking at age six. The recipe is filled with spelling errors (case in point: recipe is spelled &#8220;resapea&#8221;) and the one job my grandmother gave me, to slice the lemons, did not go so well&#8230;I sliced a nice chunk out of my finger! But I lived to tell the tale and I still love to cook, so it&#8217;s all good. </p>
<p>Glad June is getting all kinds exposure to food and all of the fun it can bring. And three cheers for Montessori school!!!</p>

      <p>Your beautiful attitude is the key to a good time.  Making dough ahead, brilliant!!!  And kids do want to contribute in meaningful ways.  And they can.  When I was nine, my mother and aunt decided I was to &#8220;keep house&#8221; for my 65 year old grandfather while my grandmother had knee surgery and rehab (8 weeks then, now would be 2 days at most).  I knew how to make Jello.  But I could read and follow instructions, and I had my mom and aunt for back up (my grandparents farm was in the middle).  It was an empowering, amazingly, life-changing experience.  Pushing a grocery cart ALONE, a signed blank check in my pocket, I was both thrilled and terrified.  My grandfather was a delight, so that helped!!</p>

      <p>Thanks. I love this write-up. My almost-5-year-old and almost-2-year-old love to help me in the kitchen (well, mostly the older one). They are both especially into making smoothies &#8212; they can dump frozen fruit into the blender, drop in globs of yogurt and handfuls of spinach, and grab other ingredients from the fridge, including a tiny squirt of chocolate sauce that they both insist on adding every time. Their favorite part is a toss-up between covering their ears while the blender runs and choosing which straw color they want. Oh, and drinking the smoothie.</p>

      <p>My earliest memories are of being that three-year-old, safely perched on my chair, next to my Mom&#8217;s shoulder, watching and helping her to cook.  And, as you mentioned, it was mostly everyday dinners, and weekend breakfasts.   My job (and any interested siblings&#8217;), was to sort (things like beans and berries), or to break up bread, crack eggs, etc.  I also learned how to measure out ingredients, how to add seasonings (&#8220;&#8230;not too much, because you can always add, but it&#8217;s hard to take it out&#8230;&#8221;), and how to mix and stir.   On Saturday and Sunday, we carefully woke my Dad with a precariously-held cup of coffee, and then we would all proceed to the kitchen for eggs and bacon and pancakes (or waffles, or French toast&#8230;).  These things are indelible; I am 54 years old, both of my parents are gone now, and yet I remember cooking with them as if it were yesterday.  We continued these traditions with my sister&#8217;s kids (the only grandkids), and we totally did the cookie thing, with my sister, niece, nephew, and I forming a production line for making everything from meatballs to gingerbread cookies.  Each of us, including the kids, had their own aprons, and everyone shared in the cleanup.  My niece is now 24, and employed as a chef in Ireland.  And my memories are awesome&#8230;  😉</p>

      <p>My two-year-old is completely involved in our cooking. This wasn&#8217;t exactly by design on my part; we just cook breakfast and dinner at home every day, usually when only one parent is available, and it&#8217;s been easier to entertain a child by involving him than having him crying outside of the kitchen or at your feet. The most important part of this is a stool we have that&#8217;s original purpose was to allow me to reach high shelves and now is completely his (last night I had to grab a chair from the dining room to get a dutch oven from a high shelf because sharing is not my son&#8217;s thing). He does all that you have mentioned here (well the only cutting he&#8217;s mastered is bananas) and a few more things, some of which make me nervous (but it&#8217;s easier to let him drop pasta in boiling water one by one with close supervision than dealing with a tantrum &#8212; even though this means that the past will not all be perfectly al dente at once). </p>
<p>A favorite recipe for cooking together is your granola (number 5, but all done on the scale with very approximate measuring) because it&#8217;s fool proof, very quick, and yet feels special and we can talk about how he made it whenever we eat it.</p>

      <p>I just wanted to share that these are some of my all time favorite cookies. I&#8217;ve been making them for years, which is actually weird to think about! Sometimes I add a bit of lemon zest to the dough and homemade lemon curd to the frosting. It&#8217;s a completely different (slightly drippy), but still really delicious cookie. I usually make one version for friends around Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>

      <p>Our only went to public school but because Washington state insists one must be 5 by august 31 she missed the opportunity to attend Kindergarten until she was almost 6 years old a November baby..She attended a school that the lady was versed in Montessori, all the kids were late date children and smart as could be they all grew up to be creative and intelligent individuals! Our only works in film and had never followed the rules as the school public held out, she graduated from high school on a Wednesday and on that Saturday from the junior college only to go to a university and be able to explore many disciplines, we  had her when her daddy was 30 and I was near enough..We were thrilled but working like crazy took its toll and she was a pistol from the get go, we rolled with everything new and creative and happy,  I lost my mom young and was tossed around and my husband had a dad never to be around to be a dad or parent a huge huge brood, he was not in a hurry to parent anyone or anything, but we did a roaring good job as she is the delight of our life and makes us feel young and vital..she is not married and travels a lot..We know about your restaurant and about your cookbook(s) too. She dined at your restaurant living up in Seattle Washington for about 4 and 1/2  years&#8230;We did not get uptight about always being the oldest mom and dad at everything we attended for our princess, as she was joined by other creative types and they formed a union of soulmates she still sees today when she is in town..Your blog is sweet and endearing and helpful your dolly June is adorable and so dadblasted cute and smart, it must be her momma and daddy&#8217;s attention and your passion for food and all that it entails..How fortunate you are to be able to do what you both want to do despite rising rents in Seattle and fickleness of customers..Enjoy your sweet angel, time will fly like no one&#8217;s business and you never get a re-doe as our only says!  Our sweet girl cooks like a gourmand and sews and designs other things, she always liked different foods and cultures and doing things. We are so proud of her each and every day!</p>

      <p>Yes, yes, YES! I remember when my daughter was three and her two cousins were four and a half and six. They all spent the night at Grandma&#8217;s house when their great-grandmother was visiting. The next day, ONLY my three year-old rolled up her sleeping bag with the two older girls saying they couldn&#8217;t do it. Great-Grandma was astounded at Kate&#8217;s competency, but those short people are so capable when given the chance. You are such a fabulous PARENT, Molly.</p>

      <p>Thank you for sharing this, Molly. My husband and I hoping to embark on this whole parents thing soon, and my two biggest worries are not getting enough sleep (which I know is just going to be reality) and not having time to cook, which is my favorite thing to do every day. I realize that cooking may not be the same when I have kids, and cooking with kids will be its own fun challenge, but it&#8217;s so comforting to know that the two worlds can go together.</p>

      <p>I love everything about this.  I think #14 is so important &#8211; teaching children skills is not convenient, but it is important.  &#8220;Competent&#8221; is one of the four adjectives my wife &amp; I selected to guide our parenting when our son was first born, so learning how to do things around the house, from an early age, is a big part of that.  My son is also 3 1/2 and he LOVES to help in the kitchen.  And, as you say, he&#8217;s gotten to where he&#8217;s actually helpful more often than not!</p>
<p>Thank you for all of the great ideas of other things I can be doing with him.  One thing we&#8217;ve added recently is having him prep (wash, chop, and put into containers) the snacks he particularly likes &#8211; fruit, especially &#8211; and put them in the fridge where he has easy access to them, so he can get them by himself.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve been so excited about getting into the kitchen with my little guy when he&#8217;s a little older ( he&#8217;s 16 months) but now I feel more prepared with your list. We have a really small kitchen so I&#8217;m thinking maybe I can set up some things on our dining room table that he can help with. He already enjoys &#8220;helping out&#8221; how he can. We can always do some meal prep of some kind at the table.</p>

      <p>My four year old helps in the kitchen (mostly dumping things, cutting soft things, and stirring, and he&#8217;s really into spinning the salad). My toddler (22 months old) loves to &#8220;wash&#8221; the veggies for soup in a sink full of water. Some great ideas here for new tasks for them, like sandwich making! </p>

      <p>Great little list, and so true. Our kids love &#8220;mixing it up&#8221; in the kitchen and there&#8217;s always a make or bake day when they&#8217;re at home on a break from school. Hell, we even set-up a &#8220;Kids in the Kitchen&#8221; section on our cooking forums so parents and grandparents can share tips and recipes.</p>
<p>Patience is the key. They&#8217;re not Cordon Bleu trained chefs and they absolutely love making a mess, so you can&#8217;t be too strict or stuffy about it &#8211; just relax and roll with it. Besides, it&#8217;s always fun and there&#8217;s always that great moment at the end when we do the &#8220;taste test&#8221; &#8211; will it be &#8220;Hmmmm&#8221; or will it be &#8220;Urghhh&#8221; ?</p>

      <p>this is just beautiful and funny.  and I LOVE doing baking projects with little friends over because my kids are always better behaved and the friends think it&#8217;s SO COOL to do kitchen work. I have some big kids (7 and 10) and that early work is paying off big time now, as they can cook meals and wash dishes and read recipes and even correlate the kitchen work to the fractions that come up in math class.  I did try to make clean-up part of the process, too, because it&#8217;s such a real part of cooking.</p>

<p>As someone who has subbed in Montessori and regular school settings, yes, it is fascinating. I love how excited and the sense of accomplishment the students have upon completing their work. It feels less like the pulling teeth/drudgery that I remember from some of my school days. That&#8217;s not to say that I didn&#8217;t have some excellent teachers. </p>

      <p>I loved this post. My daughter is 5 now and really into cooking and watching cooking shows. Cooking is still quite messy, but she is so capable. Another tip &#8212; use large, deep bowls and the mess is just a bit less with the vigorous stirring that inevitably happens. Cooking with her at the counter also led to lots of food discoveries when she would &#8220;steal&#8221; veggies from the cutting board. Turns out she likes most veggies raw.</p>

      <p>Molly, thank you for your post! My daughter   Also went to a Montessori school in the SF Bay Area, and I wish I would have done more cooking with her. She is now 27 and loves to cook.  As you know,  Montessori teaches them to be self sufficient from a young age. Your post is very valuable and I love the cookie recipe as I love all of the recipes you post!<br />

      <p>First: my husband and I cooked w/ our two sons, and eventually got to the point where one would cook dinner with the husb. one week, and the other with me the next. . . . Lasted about a year, but it was great, and both young men now have repertoires! Younger son/French major did a lot of cooking in a class at college and said he showed his non-cooking colleagues how to smush garlic to get the peel off and &#8220;they acted like I was a real chef, Mom!&#8221;       Second: I just bought both your books and read them back to back (reread Delancey, actually): what a pleasure!

      <p>As many have already said, the investment now pays dividends in the future. Raising children to be adults who aren&#8217;t intimidated by the idea of purchasing food at a market and then preparing it to eat will be a gift to them and their future families. Holidays and the few other times in the year we find ourselves in the same place always include cooking together. For me, some of the best memories are cooking at home, in cabins and cottages on vacations and now in the homes of my grown children.</p>

      <p>Just wanted to pop in to say how much I appreciated this list and how fun it has been for me to cook with my own little guy. He&#8217;s just over 2 and loves to do &#8220;bubbles&#8221;, which is washing the dishes. Which really means getting a sponge really bubbly while I wash the dishes. He loves to make smoothies and turn the blender on and off and also do the mixer. I&#8217;m amazed at how well he handles instructions regarding the various power levels. &#8220;Turn the mixer on just a little little bit&#8221; works surprisingly well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned that he loves bell peppers, bites of coconut oil (?) and salt. So fun, and you&#8217;re right, so messy. But what about parenting ISN&#8217;T messy?</p>

      <p>I try to get my daughter more and more involved in the cooking. She&#8217;s 6 now, and usually she pile the vegs or prepare the sides etc. I&#8217;m not really comfortable to give her the knives at the moment, but we&#8217;re slowly going through some of the more dangerous tools and the importance of being careful and observant in the kitchen, and she&#8217;s really enjoying it. You have to try to take different creative task so she doesn&#8217;t get bored. 🙂 Really enjoyed reading this, thanks a lot!</p>

      <p>&#8220;5. Do not cook or bake with a child when you are feeling cranky or in a hurry or are not willing to be pummeled with questions about everything. Actually maybe do not have a child if you are feeling cranky or in a hurry or are not willing to be pummeled with questions about everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>SO SO TRUE. Cranky is perhaps my word for today. And the questions!!! I&#8217;m struggling being mum to my two little ones at the moment, but I did sign up for this gig. Chin up. Tomorrow is a new day. Going to attempt pretzels tomorrow with two 3-year-olds&#8230;</p>

      <p>Love these tips and ideas! We tend to stay away from cooking anything with raw eggs in it with our 3.5 yo as she likes to lick her fingers A LOT when in the kitchen.  Some other ideas that our 3.5 yo does at home-<br />
Peeling outer layers of leaves off Brussels sprouts<br />
Pulling mushroom caps off of stems<br />
Washing carrots<br />
Shredding cooked chicken for chicken salad<br />
Smashing eggs and then mixing egg salad</p>

      <p>Dear Molly,<br />
Great post. I love your writing and always enjoy stopping by. I very much enjoyed your list of tips (no. 5 made me laugh out loud). So true.  Our girls go to a Montessori school, which I love for all the reasons you mentioned. It just makes sense. Our kids are now 5 and 7, but we&#8217;ve been cooking with them since they could sit on the counter. I wrote a post about it called, &#8220;Cooking with Children&#8221; awhile ago. There are some parallels to you thinking on the subject.<br />
Enjoy!</p>

      <p>These are great tips and observations on cooking with kids, and those pink cookies are lovely! I wholeheartedly agree that if you are going to invite a child to cook with you, you have to be willing to relax and let a whole lotta things slide (messes, sticking fingers into batter, wanting to be done when the first batch of cookies are out of the oven, messes.) I never wanted my kids to feel like making food was scary or a chore, so I invite them to cook with me often and let them do their thing. I was so proud the day I realized my daughter makes a much tastier guacamole than I do. And my son feels completely comfortable straying from a recipe to try his own variations. I think it&#8217;s great that you are encouraging the same curiosity and confidence in your daughter!</p>

      <p>I have found that my boys (1.5 and 5.5) will happily play with a small bowl of flour while I finish up almost any recipe. Yes, it makes a mess of the counter and floor, but they&#8217;re both going to need to be cleaned up anyway after cooking with kids.  We are liking making biscuits because I let them rub the butter into the dry ingredients with their fingers.</p>

      <p>You are absolutely right about not to cook with children when you are in a hurry or when you dont want your kitchen to be dirty..haha! It will only make us nuts. My daughter is 3. From this reading i get the inspiration to involve her in some means of kitchen activities within a few months. Wish me good luck!</p>

      <p>Fantastic list! I love baking with my little boy, and yes they can crack eggs much younger than I ever thought &#8211; he started when he turned one, and yes it was a mess but he loved it. Now he&#8217;s 5, measuring things and using the scales are a great way to bring numbers, addition and so on into his normal day without it feeling like school. </p>
<p>Gorgeous pictures, by the way.</p>

      <p>My just turned three year old helped mix up the Hearts and Minds cake last night for seder. Honestly, it&#8217;s kinda perfect. I melted the chocolate and butter, she mixed in the sugar, and then beat the eggs in a cup to add to the batter and mixed happily away. So many eggs to mix! </p>
<p>And considering I&#8217;m pregnant with twins(!), the fact that she can find a snack in the fridge or pantry on her own is going to be very convenient soon. Hurrah for stools!</p>

      <p>I really really REALLY love this post.  I often find that I stumble upon articles, blog posts, song lyrics, at times when I really need them.  I have a 3.5 year old at home who I have been wanting to get more involved in the kitchen.  We are a family of cooks who love to create, eat and share with loved ones.  I really want to instill that in him, I want him to know what a joy cooking can be and the great pleasure that comes from feeding people.  I also really want him to be able to feed himself more than top ramen when he gets older. However, I have been a bit weary as I am more than uptight about germs and cross contamination and cleanliness in the kitchen, but you are so right!  Messes can be cleaned up and germs can be killed, so its really about preparing for him in the kitchen and putting some thought into the things he can help make.  AND boy would he love to learn how to crack an egg.  I think this weekend, with my husband on standby to talk me off the ledge when egg inevitably lands on the floor, he will learn to crack an egg!</p>

      <p>We did not get uptight about always being the oldest mom and dad at everything we attended for our princess, as she was joined by other creative types and they formed a union of soulmates she still sees today when she is in town..Your blog is sweet and endearing and helpful your dolly June is adorable and so dad blasted cute and smart, it must be her mommy and daddy’s attention and your passion for food and all that it entails.Each of us, including the kids, had their own aprons, and everyone shared in the cleanup. My niece is now 24, and employed as a chef in Ireland. And my memories are awesome.</p>

      <p>I have a 3 yr old as well ( plus an 8 yr old, 20 yr old and 21 yr old&#8230; I&#8217;m 47 and tired, lol )  Cooking /baking is so much fun with her because she gets so excited to look at all my cookbooks &#8230;every page. (just like her mama 😄 ) She is hilarious to chat with and man,  she tries so hard to control herself when stirring, pouring , adding ingredients etc. She is my wild one so I can really appreciate her efforts ! What she can&#8217;t control whatsoever,  is sneaking tastes and often ends up consuming her weight in batter or frosting &#8230;.all 29 lbs of her 🙅  I pretend not to notice 😉  On another note , I have my Montessori teaching  degree and taught in Seattle for years before I became a SAH mom. The owner/director of the school I taught at, Childrens World Montessori ,   has been a prominent fixture in the Montessori world for over 25+ years now and runs schools at several locations. I taught in Wedgewood next to AE- 2 as well as in the old Sandpoint Elementary school building . She has a school at U Village and another located in Westlake Center &#8230;a few doors down from Palomino&#8217;s , yummmmm 🍴🍝🍸 Lunch time field trip anyone ?  The Practical Life skills were always my favorite lessons to present and teach and a favorite of my little students as well. Everyone wanted to rush to the PL area first thing every morning after circle . They couldn&#8217;t get enough of being allowed to do certain tasks on their own, with REAL equipment and materials !! From folding napkins, sweeping, pouring water, peeling a carrot, poishing a shoe etc&#8230;small children love to help and ya gotta get em&#8217; involved while they are still interested and willing 😋 It&#8217;s not long before they barely give you the time of day and if they do, its usually with an extreme eye roll and an accompanying gutteral sound or snotty comment. Charming 😛 . Until then, I hope June is enjoying school and learning how to become great little sous chef &#8230;or at least happy to help clean up. I&#8217;m thinking we have a few good years left , lol  ✌😄</p>
