    <p>God, my apartment is hot. It&#8217;s not even that horrible outside on this sunny Seattle evening, but the kitchen is a blazing inferno. Jess, my dinner guest, will be shortly. The yogurt cake with lemon zest and lemon glaze is resting contentedly on the counter, seemingly oblivious to the heat. The sockeye is roasting ever so gently in the oven. I&#8217;ve got the fan firmly parked in the doorway to the thing I optimistically call the balcony, and I&#8217;ve got myself firmly parked in front of it. I feel shiny. It may be time to get the wine out of the fridge. Oh, how I suffer.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve rediscovered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000001HT9/ref=m_art_li_6/103-4228601-9646216?v=glance&amp;s=music">the Old 97s album &#8220;Wreck Your Life,&#8221;</a> and I can sing<em> just like</em> Rhett Miller. I&#8217;m so impressed. It looks like growing up in Oklahoma pays off after all; I can get a nice, soulful twang and sway my hips like a two-stepping pro, preferably while wagging a chef&#8217;s knife over a pile of steaming potatoes. Too bad I don&#8217;t look like Rhett Miller too.</p>
<p>The doorbell will ring any minute, and soon the sockeye and I will be fork-tender. As for you, dear reader: may your apartment possess a powerful air conditioner; may your evening filled with the best of company, and may your cakes be always light and lemony.</p>

    <p>This type of cake is an old classic in France, the sort of humble treat that a grandmother would make. Traditionally, the ingredients are measured in a yogurt jar, a small glass cylinder that holds about 125 ml. Because most American yogurts don&#8217;t come in such smart packaging, you&#8217;ll want to know that 1 jar equals about 1/2 cup.</p>
  </div>

      <div class="recipe-list">
              <h3>For the cake:
</h3>                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 jar plain yogurt
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            2 jars granulated sugar
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            3 large eggs
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            3 jars unbleached all-purpose flour
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            2 tsp. baking powder
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            2 tsp. grated lemon zest
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1 jar canola oil
          </div>
                      <h3>For the glaze:
</h3>                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            Juice from 2 lemons
          </div>
                  <div class="ingredient" itemprop="ingredients">
            1/2 jar powdered sugar          </div>
                  </div>
  
      <div itemprop="instructions">
      <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, sugar, and eggs, stirring until well blended. Add the flour, baking powder, and zest, mixing to just combine. Add the oil and stir to incorporate. At first, it will look like a horrible, oily mess, but keep stirring, and it will come together into a smooth batter. Pour and scrape the batter into a buttered 9-inch round cake pan (after buttering, I sometimes line the bottom with a round of wax or parchment paper, and then I butter that too).</p>
<p>Bake for 30-35 minutes, until the cake feels springy to the touch and a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Do not overbake.</p>
<p>Cool cake on a rack for about 20 minutes; then turn it out of the pan to cool completely.</p>
<p>When the cake is thoroughly cooled, combine the lemon juice and powdered sugar in a small bowl and spoon it gently over the cake. The glaze will be thin and will soak in like a syrup.<br />
Serve.</p>
<p><em>Variations</em>: This type of yogurt-based cake is a terrific base for many improvisations. For a basic yogurt cake, leave out the lemon zest and do not use the lemon juice glaze. For an almond version, try replacing 1 jar of flour with 1 jar of finely ground almonds. You can also play with adding various fruits (if frozen, do NOT thaw before adding) or nuts, if you like. When I add fruit, I generally pour half the cake batter into the prepared pan, top it with a layer of fruit, and then pour in the other half of the batter, sometimes adding more fruit on the very top.</p>

      <p>This is the second recipe I&#8217;ve made from your site. I made a plain yogurt cake, as I had no almonds on hand and my frozen strawberries looked rather sad. Since I was doing equally poorly on the citrus front, I made a chocolate glaze with Valhrona semi-sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, sour cream and a hint of vanilla (From a gourmet recipe). The tang of the sour cream worked beautifully with the cake. Yum!</></>I haven&#8217;t been reading your site for long, but it&#8217;s already a favourite &#8212; and it&#8217;s especially meaningful to me, as it was a recommendation from my mother, who is terminally ill. She&#8217;s a wonderful cook and loved your site, and she was delighted to hear I&#8217;ve been making recipes from the site.</></>Kind regards,</>Alison</p>

      <p>Thought you might like to know this cake is fantastic for vegans. I&#8217;ve made it several times using soy yogurt and egg replacer and it works perfectly.  I found the recipe serendipitously around the time I was thinking of tossing the little yogurt jars I&#8217;d brought back from France as souvenirs &#8211; now they hold an honored place on my baking shelf.</p>

      <p>Oh Kate, re: the Old 97s, you&#8217;re definitely not alone!  <>BIG<> fan here.</></>That&#8217;s great to know, Whitney!  Thank you.</></>And no, Wendy, you&#8217;re not naive.  &#8220;Jar&#8221; is not a normal term of measurement!  As I noted above, just below the photograph, the traditional way of making this cake calls for the ingredients to be measured in little glass yogurt jars.  (In France, that&#8217;s how many yogurts are packaged.)  For our purposes in the States (or in other places where yogurt doesn&#8217;t come in cute little jars), know that <>1 jar equals about 1/2 cup<>.  So 3 jars of flour is 1 1/2 cups.</p>

      <p>hi! i first saw a plain version of this recipe on clotilde&#8217;s site; and since i don&#8217;t really like plain yogurt, i made it with strawberry yogurt&#8230; those that come with fruit bits. it was a hit! C&#038;Z had different ratios, but i&#8217;ll try yours next time. =)</></>what i&#8217;m attempting to do is make a sugarfree version of this for diabetic relatives. i tried using splenda/sucralose, but i ended up with pound cake. very dense. any tips?</></>ohh&#8230; we get our yogurts in those cute 125ml cups, too, aside from pints. but since i doubled clotilde&#8217;s recipe to make a bigger cake, and iften make more than one, i converted mine to normal measurements, so i can just weigh everything out. or i&#8217;m just OC. =D</p>

I haven&#8217;t tried using it, myself, so I&#8217;m not sure how it behaves in baked goods.  But by god, if anyone can figure it out, I&#8217;ll bet you can!

Really one of my favorite cakes ever!</></>I have a question &#8211; I&#8217;m a very novice baker, and this cake&#8217;s consistency reminded me of Japanese castella, a honey sponge cake (and my all time favorite cake!).  I wanted to substitute honey for the sugar to see how it would turn out, and all of the resources I saw recommended that for each cup of sugar replaced with 3/4 cup of honey, a 1/4 of liquid should be removed.  What would constitute &#8220;liquid&#8221; in this recipe?</></>Thank you so much for any advice you can give me!</p>

      <p>Thanks for so many nice comments and cheers, friends!</></>Marirob, I&#8217;m woefully late in responding to your question &#8211; I was away from the computer, out traveling with my mom &#8211; but you know, I think the &#8220;liquid&#8221; here is yogurt.  I&#8217;d try playing with that, although it will change the flavor profile of the cake a bit.  Keep me posted as you tweak and taste&#8230;</></>Good question, Leen.  I&#8217;ve never tried making this in a loaf pan, but it can certainly be done.  The volume of an 8-inch loaf pan is smaller than that of a 9-inch round, though, so you&#8217;ll have a bit too much batter for your pan.  I would plan to pour about two-thirds of the batter into the loaf pan, and maybe use the rest for a few cupcakes.  You shouldn&#8217;t need to adjust the oven temperature &#8211; just keep your eye on the cake as it bakes, and when it starts to look golden on top, stick it with a toothpick or a thin knife.  If the toothpick comes out clean, it&#8217;s ready.  If not, continue to bake until it does.  (And if the cake is getting too brown before it&#8217;s fully baked, tent it with a sheet of aluminum foil.)  Good luck!</p>

      <p>I finally made this cake, and it was good. I kept sneaking back into the kitchen last nite to steal little slivers. </></>I must say that I was a little nervous about it, because there is no salt or vanilla. But it turned out great, and my fears were unfounded. I suppose the yogurt maybe has a bit of salt?, and the lemons make you forget about the vanilla. Oh well no need to analyze it, as long as it is good.</p>

      <p>Molly,</></>I am planning on serving this at a dinner party tomorrow night.  I have 2 questions.</></>I have nonfat plain yogurt in my fridge right now.  Will that work? or do I need to by a cup of the full fat stuff?  </></>If I want to make it tonight and serve it tomorrow, should I glaze it tonight?  Or back it and wrap it tonight, and glaze it a couple hours before.  I don&#8217;t want it to dry out.  If I can&#8217;t do any if it ahead of time, then it will be molasses cookies and vanilla ice cream all the way&#8230;</p>

      <p>Not to worry, dc365.  You can use your nonfat yogurt.  I&#8217;ve used nonfat before, and it works fine &#8211; it&#8217;s just that the cake will be a teensy bit drier and more crumbly.  As for when to glaze it, you can go either way.  I might suggest, though, that you glaze it the day you plan to serve it, just so that the glaze doesn&#8217;t get smudged or mussed when the cake is wrapped overnight.  </></>Does that help?  Happy dinner partying!</p>

      <p>It took me awhile, but last night I finally found the time, the gumption and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; the yogurt to make this cake!  And it was simple, quick and &#8211; most impotantly &#8211; delicious!  I ended up using all olive oil as this is what I had at hand.  The batter tasted like olive oil, but the cake came out with Tuscan perfection &#8211; with a hint of sweetness and an exclamation of homemade.  Had I had the time and gumption to make a compote or (and add to this formula the arrival of wild berries &#8211; which I hear is only two weeks away) blueberry sour cream ice cream, I think I would have achieved perfection. But my slice of it suited me just fine!  </></>What a fine cake to have as the source of introduction to your future husband.  It bodes well for a very happy life &#8211; laced, as it is, with sweetness and symbolic of how well one can live with a well-stocked pantry!</p>

      <p>Molly, your site is really wonderful.  Thank you for your thoughts and for sharing your recipes.  </></>I tried this recipe tonight.  It was tasty but was not cooked in the middle although it was brown on the top (cooked for about 40-45 minutes).  Would using vegetable oil instead of canola oil effect it?  I used my 9&#8243; removable bottom cake pan for the first time and struggled getting it out.  Any tips?</></>I would love to get this one right because the cake was very tasty (minus the middle part).  </></>Thank you again.  You are a great inspiration.</p>

      <p>Sorry for the delay in my reply, Marissa.  Thanks so much for your sweet words!  As for your trouble with the cake, you know, I&#8217;ll bet your oven&#8217;s temperature is slightly off.  Since the cake browned before it was fully cooked through, I&#8217;m inclined to think that your oven runs a little too hot.  Most ovens are not perfectly accurate; mine, for example, runs about 10 degrees cooler than what I&#8217;ve set it for.  I know this because I always keep an oven thermometer inside, so once the oven is preheated, I can peek in to check its internal temperature and adjust the settings as needed.  Do you have an oven thermometer?  They&#8217;re available at nearly any grocery store, in the baking section, and you just hang it from one of the oven racks.  You can leave it there all the time.  It&#8217;s been a huge help in my baking &#8211; hope it does the same for you!  As for the trouble you had getting the cake out of the pan, did you put down parchment paper?  When I butter the pan and line the bottom with parchment paper, which I then butter as well, I never have trouble with sticking. </></>I hope this helps!  Better luck next time.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly, I watched your video over Food Network&#8230;what a lovely story! Just like to let you know, both myself and a cyber friend of mine have just tried baking your lemon yogurt cake, and we baked the cake at about the same time, but over at 2 locations. My friend&#8217;s version was beautiful&#8230;while mine didn&#8217;t turn out that well ;p</>anyway, it still tasted very good! Thank you for sharing your recipes and your story. I&#8217;ll be a frequent visitor of Orangette!</p>

      <p>hi Molly, </></>I&#8217;ve mad this cake on several occasions and it&#8217;s always a hit &#8211; but the question is: how should I store it? Also, what would you recommend doing to make it moister? I feel it&#8217;s drying out too quickly, probably because of my oven running a bit hotter than usual. </></>All in all, it&#8217;s an AMAZING cake&#8230;thank you!</p>

      <p>Hi, pasc.  Glad you like the cake!  As for storing it, I usually leave mine at room temperature, covered tightly with plastic wrap.  It&#8217;s good that way for up to a few days, and its texture stays much better (moister, softer) than it would in the fridge.  </></>As for the moisture level of the cake when freshly baked, hmm.  This is a cake that tends to be on the drier side, with a very light crumb.  That&#8217;s part of why a thin, syrupy glaze works nicely with it, I think: it really soaks in.  But if the cake seems too noticeably dry, I wonder if it might be your oven.  Do you keep an oven thermometer in it?  You know, one of those little cheap ones that you can buy at the grocery store?  I find that those are crucial in baking, just so you can really monitor your oven temperature.  </></>I hope that helps at least a little!</p>

      <p>I have yet to try this cake (and as I haven&#8217;t ever made a cake before, I am quite nervous about its turnout), but I do have a question.  I know you said to use unthawed fruit as a variation, but what about fresh, sliced strawberries with a strawberry glaze on top?

      <p>Max, I&#8217;m not totally sure how to answer your question.  Are you asking about our video on the Food Network (as linked in the sidebar, to the right)?  If so, click on the link, which will take you to the Food Network &#8220;Power of Food&#8221; page.  From there, look just to the right of the video window, and you&#8217;ll see an archive list.  Click on &#8220;Lemon cake.&#8221;  That&#8217;s our video.  Hope that answers your question&#8230;</p>

      <p>I just made the almond meal version of this cake &#8212; after craving for some simple recipe that didn&#8217;t need frosting, room-temperature butter, or my KitchenAid (which needed a break). It came together in minutes, and it finished baking in the time it took me to clean the kitchen tonight! It has such an intriguing taste with the almond meal: very subtle, not sugary at all, rich-tasting without being full-fat. The texture was pleasing (with three eggs, it better!) It&#8217;s a perfect breakfast cake. I can&#8217;t wait to eat some more tomorrow morning! Thanks for the recipe.</p>

      <p>Oh my God, that cake. Topped it with a little one-minute chocolate faux-ganache, just two tbsp. butter and a quarter of a bag of chocolate chips.

      <p>Molly, it has taken a very long time for me to try your yogurt cake, but this tasty treat made a number of new friends this morning. A roofing/deck repair crew showed up at first light &#8211; and today in Seattle you know that was cold and breezy &#8211; looking frozen and miserable even before they began work. Fresh coffee warmed their hands, but the lemon cake brought smiles all day. OK, the warm kitchen was an attraction, but they were really after just one more piece of that cake. What a lovely result from such an easy recipe!</p>

      <p>Helen, I do worry a little bit that the buttermilk might make the batter too runny, but somehow I think it would work just fine.  It&#8217;s worth a try, I think&#8230;</p>

      <p>yeah, you may be right.  i wonder if it would be ok if i added a little less buttermilk.  i better just stick w/ the yogurt.  oh, and i used nonfat greek yogurt and olive oil, and the cake turned out lovely!</p>

      <p>Molly, I made this cake last night and it was wonderful (and so simple)! I doubled the quantity of yogurt and used olive oil which made it lovely and sticky and moist. </>I have been blissfully happy ever since I stumbled across your site a couple weeks ago.

      <p>So, I had a bunch of blood oranges that were sad looking, so I made candied blood orange slices, which also gave me blood orange simple syrup. I made this cake using blood orange instead of lemon, and I added a layer of the candied slices when I poured it in the pan. I used the blood orange simple syrup and a little juice as the glaze, and it was WONDERFUL, thank you for sharing such a versatile recipe!</p>

      <p>This is probably the best cake I&#8217;ve ever eaten.  I just love the bright clean flavor and the crunchy crust it developed (I may have over-baked it a bit, but I like things on the tan side).  I forgot that I didn&#8217;t have powdered sugar for the frosting, so we are eating the cake as is, but it is still wonderful.  I am going to be making this again and again.  I&#8217;d like to serve it with whipped cream and fruit next time. I&#8217;m reading your book&#8211;a great read and an inspiration.  Thanks so much.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly,</></>I&#8217;ve been following your blog for at least six months but didn&#8217;t have a chance to try any of the recipes until yesterday, when I made the yogurt-lemon cake to share with a couple of friends who came over for dessert and a movie. I used the recipe from the website to make the cake batter but turned to your book for the lemon syrup and icing instructions &#8211; and the result was absolutely delicious! Even my husband liked it, and he doesn&#8217;t normally like citrus-flavored things. </></>I did, however, learn my lesson about the importance of using quality ingredients. Before spooning the icing on the cake, I decided to sample it and was shocked when all I could taste was cornstarch (and a bit of lemon). Apparently the cheap store-brand powdered sugar that I used was actually a mixture of sugar and cornstarch. You couldn&#8217;t really taste the starch on the finished cake, but still, it was a disappointment. I&#8217;ve been living in the US for nearly 15 years now but I still can&#8217;t get used to all the extra ingredients that manufacturers here sneak into their products in an effort to save costs or conceal the lack of real flavor. </></>Thank you for the wonderful blog and an equally wonderful book, and good luck with the rest of your book tour! I hope to meet you at Third Place in a couple of weeks. </></>Irina</p>

      <p>Anonymous, I think a 9-inch springform pan should work, but I worry about some of batter seeping out the edges of the base.  This cake batter isn&#8217;t terribly thick &#8211; only moderately so &#8211; so it really might leak out a little bit.  If you have some parchment paper, you could try lining the pan with that.  It might help.</p>

      <p>I made this cake for girls-night-in and it was a hit. Even though I mixed the oil in with the other wet ingredients instead of at the end. This is a very forgiving recipe and a definite keeper!</p>

      <p>Hi Molly! I am recent convert to Orangette and I just love love love your blog! You write with such wit and charm making your recipes impossible to resist! I recently made your French Style Yogurt Cake with Lemon for my mom&#8217;s birthday to rave reviews. I hate to admit it, but I did make a few changes. I substituted a lemon-thyme simple syrup for the lemon glaze and topped it off with homemade blueberry sauce. It was fabulous! You even inspired me to start my own food blog! Thank you so much for sharing all of your fabulous recipes and stories! I&#8217;ll definitely be back again and again.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly, my family is in love with your recipes. I have recently returned from college and have been spending my days cooking while everyone is at work. They can&#39;t wait to come home at night to see what I have whipped up. Tonight I made your french yogurt cake and served it with strawberries and the lemon icing with syrup&#8230;it was delicious! I can&#39;t wait for your return&#8230;until then bon appetit!</p>

      <p>Hi Molly</p>
<p>I just made the yogurt cake recipe from your book last night and it is AMAZING.  I was trying to find the full fat plain yogurt you recommended but the grocery store didn&#39;t have any that day. So I used full fat sour cream instead.  Now I haven&#39;t tried the yogurt version, but man the sour cream cake is delicious!  Any idea how it might be differ from the yogurt version?  </p>
<p>And would lowfat yogurt have also worked?  Or is full fat the key?  Just so I know for next time 🙂</p>

      <p>Pravina Studio, I&#39;ll bet this cake was fantastic with sour cream!  Sour cream has more fat than whole-milk yogurt, so I imagine it just made the cake all the more moist. As for your question, re: low-fat yogurt, yes, you can certainly use it, but I think it makes for a cake that&#39;s a tiny bit less moist and tender.  It would still be very good, and frankly, you might not notice any difference, but the extra fat in whole-milk yogurt (or sour cream, for that matter!) is helpful in guarding against a dry cake.</p>

      <p>I have been loving your book and even went as far as to go out to buy a beautiful glass cake stand so I could make this cake and display it (for the short time I anticipate it will last!). One novice baker question for you: the recipe calls for all-purpose flour, but any reason why I couldn&#39;t use cake/pastry flour?</p>

      <p>Anonymous, I love that you bought a cake stand for this!  So pretty.  And as for your flour question, this recipe is designed for all-purpose flour, but you can substitute cake flour, yes.  You&#39;ll need to use a different amount, though.  <a href="http://bakingbites.com/2007/05/subbing-all-purpose-flour-for-cake-flour/" rel="nofollow">Here</a>&#39;s a great explanation of the difference between the two flours and how much to use when you&#39;re substituting one for the other.</p>

      <p>My partner was making this cake the other night for a dinner party at our house, had just added one jar of flour when the phone rang, she went back to the cake and moved on to the next ingredient forgetting the rest of the flour. We tossed in some blueberries too. The result was a thinner, custard-like sponge cake. She was ready to toss it in the trash and race up to the grocery store to buy dessert. No, no, no said I, never waste food. She made 1/2 the glaze recipe which it soaked right up. It was Heaven on a plate. </p>
<p>We have a rule in our house, never modify a Molly recipe, there is no reason to mess with perfection. This was an accident worth repeating, which we did for a casual dinner with friends the next night, 4 of us. The whole cake got eaten little sliver by little sliver until it was all gone.</p>

      <p>Molly, this cake is now my family&#39;s favorite dessert of all time (my mother claims to like it even more than key lime pie &#8211; this is a big deal). I served mine with little white raspberries and plump, juicy blueberries. . . It was delicious.

      <p>As one who is hesitant to bake anything without chocolate, this was so, so good!  I baked this cake while dog sitting (a puppy Pomeranian) for a friend, and with just a hint of regret, left her a rather large piece to come home to. I finished off the rest in just a few days, eating very skinny pieces at a time so that it felt like I wasn&#39;t being too greedy.  🙂  I&#39;m so happy to hear about all the great news coming from Delancy.  You are the reason I want to get out to Seattle one day!</p>

      <p>Janet, that&#39;s a good question.  The cake will not hold all of the syrup without dripping, no.  I still go ahead and pour it all, because I like the tartness and moisture it gives, but there&#39;s usually some syrup that flows over the edge of the cake and isn&#39;t absorbed.</p>

      <p>I&#39;ve been a long time lurker on your site but I had to comment on the yogurt cake!  I made it twice &#8211; the first time I overbaked it (even though you warned not to&#8230;my bad), but it was still good as a teacake with a hot cup of tea.  The second time it came out perfect in just under 25 minutes.</p>
<p>My yogurt was extra runny (I live in China and they LOVE drinkable yoghurt&#8230;they just stick a straw in the top of the cup), so I added a little extra, and the cake turned out perfectly moist.  It&#39;s half gone already.  Thank you!<br />Camilla</p>

      <p>Molly&#8211;I just finished your book (wow, what a treat) after just discovering your blog (where have I been?! I feel a bit like Rip Van Winkle, waking from a long culinary sleep). <br />The lemon cake brought tears to my eyes:  my grandmother made only one dessert, a homey lemon cake, the ingredients for which she measured out in a coffee cup and regular spoons from her silverware.  She never owned measuring cups or spoons,and her repertoire was very limited: M = this, T = that, etc.  But she was a fantastic, inspiring cook.  She&#39;s been gone a long time now, and how I miss her coffee, her lemon cake, her pot roast, her very spartan kitchen.<br />Thanks for your writing and the way it helps us remember.</p>

      <p>Hi:</p>
<p>Thanks so much for this lovely recipe.</p>
<p>I made it this week for my dad&#39;s neighbor&#39;s 90th birthday brunch &#8212; my dad insists on icing, so I frosted it rather than soaking it with glaze.</p>
<p>I had some blood oranges, so used that zest instead of lemon &#8212; the icing was powdered sugar, blood orange juice, &#038; more zest &#8212; since the juice is deep red, the icing came out a very beautiful pink.  </p>
<p>The icing is pretty sweet, so this simple cake was perfect with it &#8212; looked absolutely gorgeous &#038; tasted wonderful too &#8212; everyone loved it.  </p>
<p>I can&#39;t wait to try some of the variations mentioned here &#8212; this seems like a foolproof cake for all occasions, &#038; I&#39;m very glad to know about it.</p>

<p>as an american that married into a bhutanese family, i&#39;ve been introducing them to the tastes that i love, just as they&#39;re doing for me. i made a non-lemon version of this, mixing golden raisins and chopped walnuts into the batter and topping with apple slices and a sprinkling of brown sugar. almost everything&#8211;yogurt and eggs included&#8211;were locally produced. my 8 nieces and nephews loved it as it was, sans icing or glaze, and they would like to thank you for the new &#8220;taste experience&#8221;!</p>

      <p>I finished your book in one sitting. Actually, two: One in bed for two hours and then the husband kicked me out into the living room at 3 am. Point taken.</p>
<p>Anyway, this was one of the recipes, one of the many, that caught my attention.</p>
<p>I may have, however, in a fit of madness that is end of term, put in the zest of two lemons rather than 2 tsp lemon zest. It was still divine. Albeit a bit tangy.</p>

      <p>I made this cake today as a dessert to bring to my parent&#39;s house for Easter, and I must say that it was amazing!!  While cooking it made my house smell wonderfully lemony, and when I took it out of the oven I had to restrain myself from digging into it immediately!  I was somehow able to wait, and got it to my parent&#39;s house intact.  It was a huge hit, and I&#39;m thinking of making it again for my grandfather&#39;s upcoming 80th birthday party as I think it is something he&#39;ll love.  It may be my new favorite (non-chocolate) cake 🙂  Thank you so much for sharing this delicious recipe!!</p>

      <p>Dania, I&#39;m sorry for not replying sooner! I&#39;m almost certain that the problem is this: your oven is running too hot.  It&#39;s cooking the outside of the cake before the inside has time to cook.  The next time you&#39;re at the grocery store, buy an oven thermometer.  It costs about $5.  Put it in the center of the oven the next time you preheat it, and before you put anything in to bake, check to see what temperature it says.  If it&#39;s hotter than it&#39;s supposed to be, just adjust the temperature dial on the oven until the thermometer shows that the temperature inside is correct.</p>

      <p>Molly, I think you may have saved me from summer&#39;s worth of yard work!</p>
<p>Last week I came home to find that my neighbor had mowed my lawn, unsolicited. To thank him, I baked him your Winning Hearts and Minds Cake. But he wasn&#39;t home when I tried to deliver it. I restrained myself for about 15 minutes. And then I decided I would just have to make him something else, and helped myself, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Then I made him this yogurt cake,using Meyer lemon. Yesterday he told me that he wished I had a bigger lawn, so he could have more cake!</p>

      <p>Hi Molly! I was so excited to bake this cake but the top cracked and the middle remained uncooked.  I tried giving it an extra two mins&#8230;then five minutes&#8230; then ten..then I eventually gave up &#038; I think I&#39;ll just cut the centre out.</p>
<p>Any idea why it didn&#39;t work? I used olive oil and a fan-forced electric oven. Thank you!</p>

      <p>Liz, I&#39;m so sorry that it didn&#39;t work for you!  My sense is that your oven is running too cool.  Do you have an oven thermometer? (In the States, you can buy oven thermometers at most grocery stores, and they&#39;re cheap &#8211; about five bucks.)  I&#39;ve made this recipe eight times in the past two weeks &#8211; I&#39;ve been teaching it in cooking classes &#8211; and none of them baked for more than 35 minutes.</p>

      <p>Thanks Molly, I&#39;ve never seen oven thermometers here but I&#39;ll have a look in the department stores. In the meantime, maybe I&#39;ll try again &#038; crank the oven an extra 10 degrees or so.</p>
<p>As for my attempt, I cut out the mushy centre &#038; it almost looks like I used a ring tin (almost!) &#8211; &#038; it tastes pretty good. </p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

      <p>Molly, thanks for a brilliant cake. I&#39;ve made it many times over the last year or so, and I think I&#39;m going to have to start handing out cards with the recipe (and an orangette link) on, because *everyone* asks, usually with their mouths full. I like it best with some ground almonds, but if I&#39;m just using flour, I add vanilla, because I love lemon-vanilla. This time I did an English take on a French cake &#8211; the recipe is just right for two Victoria sponge layers, which I drizzled as usual and then sandwiched with lemon curd. Served with creme fraiche, slightly sweetened and with a drop or two of vanilla, plus fresh blueberries. I think next time I may have to try baking the blueberries right in&#8230; oh, and if you only have two eggs left? Go ahead! Make it anyway! It&#39;ll be fine! in fact, it was a little easier for the layers, as they didn&#39;t get quite so high in the middle.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly.<br />Love trying your recipes,it&#39;s exciting for me and they came out delicious.You can&#39;t imagine how my husband loved this cake!Thank you so much.<br />And I have a question.I don&#39;t like using butter in plain cakes generally,I use vegetable oil or olive oil.And generally I add oil before the flour mixture.Is there a specific reason for adding oil in the end?Or yogurt at first?For example;if I want to make this cake with ricotta instead of yogurt should I began with it,like you do?<br />Ok,that makes three questions.<br />Thank you!<br />Duygu</p>

      <p>Duygu, to be honest, I&#39;m not entirely sure why this recipe calls for the oil to be added last.  I agree with you that it <i>does</i> seem like it should be added sooner!  But every recipe I&#39;ve seen for French yogurt cake has called for it to be added last, so I haven&#39;t questioned it.  I do as I&#39;m told!  </p>
<p>Also, if you want to substitute ricotta for the yogurt, yes, I would mix it in at the beginning, with the eggs and the sugar.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly,</p>
<p>I made this cake this morning with my daughters (4 and 8 years old) and a couple of their friends.  They loved measuring everything in a yogurt jar, and the small yogurt jar was easier for the younger ones to pour the ingredients from than large measuring cups.  We made it with meyer lemon as we had a couple meyer lemons sitting on the counter, and it came out beautifully.  The kids ate it warm with fruit and yogurt for a snack.  They loved it and asked me to tell you thank you for the yummy cake recipe!</p>

      <p>Hi Molly, from still-chilly Maine!<br />I just finished This Homemade Life, (read most of it on the treadmill, which cancelled out the calories I burned thereon), and made the Lemon Yogurt cake the other day. My hubby and I loved it. I put on only the first glaze, so it could have used fruit or the icing, which I will do next time. But the cake itself is beautiful, light, tasty and a keeper. I so enjoyed reading about you and Brandon and your family. I feel like part of it. Best, and when I get it up to speed, I&#39;ll encourage to read my still  nascent food blog: plating it up on wordpress. Kate Cone</p>

      <p>I made this for my father-in-law&#39;s birthday (along with a chocolate cake because I wasn&#39;t sure of his preference) and EVERYONE wanted the lemony yogurt cake. It was so good.  Soooo good. I served it with fruit and only used half the lemon syrup (as the recipe says, it&#39;s not a thick glaze and I freaked out the cake would be overwhelmingly lemony). The leftover kept well for a couple days sitting on the counter.  I will definitely make this again!</p>

      <p>This cake is amazing. By far the best cake recipe I&#39;ve come across. Love the simplicity and ease of preparation. I use greek yogurt and olive oil, extra zest, sometimes scrape a vanilla bean into the mix. At times I cut in half, fill it with whipped chévre + honey. My favorite variation involves thinly sliced lemons, blanched and then place in a pan with equal parts water and sugar&#8230; let them slowly cook for an hour or so, until translucent. Place the lemons on top of the cake and drizzle with the now honey colored syrup. Or&#8230; I allow the syrup to cool and whip it with cream. I could go on and on&#8230; </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

      <p>Yep, this cake is FANTASTIC! Third time I&#39;m making it in a month. The first time I used no lemon zest or glaze, second time just zest no glaze, today I&#39;m doing both. It keeps getting better! Love how simple it is.</p>

      <p>Made this today with 1/2 cup of frozen mixed berries and subsitituted 1/2 a cup of flour with almond meal and it tasted absolutely divine! Thanks for sharing 🙂</p>

      <p>Hi Molly! I love all your recipes. I tried making this cake a few days back. It came out great &#8211; moist and golden. However, the glaze made it very sour! Almost inedible, in fact. Could my lemons be the culprit? I used the juice of two lemons and 1/4 cup of icing sugar, like you had mentioned in the recipe.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

      <p>Sarah, sadly, I wish I had written this recipe differently! I think the problem is the varying size and juiciness of lemons. The amount of juice is different in every lemon, so calling for the juice of two lemons is a silly way to measure. I&#39;m sorry about that. I put a newer version of this recipe in my book, and there, I call for 1/4 cup of lemon juice. That, mixed with 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, should be perfect.</p>

      <p>I adore this recipe! We had bought a case-yes a case- of Greek yogurt with various flavors.  I&#39;ve had a lot of fun mixing and matching citrus flavors. My husband loves the strawberry and blood orange. This such a wonderful and easy cake. Thank you for posting this!</p>

      <p>This recipe is now the first one in my recipe book, as of the last two years. I found your book in a used book store and couldn&#39;t put it down &#8211; every single thing I&#39;ve tried is fabulous! And like you, this cake has become intertwined with my love life. I made this cake while studying abroad in Greece, borrowing a friends&#39; oven since my apartment was only equipped with a mini fridge and hot plate. The morning after serving it at our first school potluck, I came home to discover an oven had been delivered to my kitchen. <br />I made it several weeks later and was nearly hired to make several more for my new favorite tapas bar. After their chef tried it, we started spending every day together sharing wine and food. The &#8220;Winning Hearts and Minds&#8221; cake sealed the deal. And let me just say, Greece was the perfect environment for this cake. Fresh picked lemons, greek yogurt, olive oil&#8230; Truly the most indulgent three months of my life. <br />Thank you so much for all your inspired recipes and musings.</p>

      <p>Made the cake last night for parents&#39; anniversary and they loved it.  I doubled the recipe &#038; did half as cupcakes.  The cupcakes came out deliciously; a bit denser and darker with more chew.  Because I doubled, I did 3 jars almond flour &#038; 3 jars regular &#8211; it really adds a nice subtle flavor.  I glazed and covered the cake after ~45 mins (before it was completely cool) and I think the steam softened the cake &#8211; it&#39;s so soft, moist, and delicious!</p>

      <p>Thank you so much for this recipe. NO MORE MEASURING CUPS TO WASH! My family LOVES this cake and always request that I make it. I use 2 teaspoons of lemon extract instead of the zest, and a bit of vanilla sugar. I also top it with sliced almonds and my god&#8230; it is so addictive. It takes much longer than 35 minutes to bake in my oven (and I use a 9 inch round pan), probably close to 45 minutes. But this could be because my jar of yogurt is 2/3 cup not 1/2 cup. I also made it in a 9&#215;13 pan with great results. </p>

      <p>A bit late on this one, but this is so delicious. I subbed sour cream since I didn&#39;t have any yogurt handy and it turned out great! Thanks for posting this, I&#39;ve been looking for something resembling my grandmothers for a while now and this is very close.</p>

This has been a tough few months and so I love reading your tales from your sweet life so much.<br />Anyway-just a thank you. I look forward to your recipes and writing.</p>

      <p>I wanted to let you know that this is one of my favourite cake recipes (since I&#39;m not really a &#8220;cake person,&#8221; and this one is nice and light!) </p>
<p>I got married last summer and my mom made about 11 of these to have as our wedding cake.  We didn&#39;t use the glaze but instead just topped with fresh whipped cream and berries &#8211; luxury of a summer wedding!  It was just perfect and I wanted to thank you for contributing to our simple, special day!</p>

      <p>Anonymous, I can&#39;t say for sure what went wrong with your cake, but large air holes are often the result of overmixing. And as for the density issue, I wonder if your oven temperature is off and running too cool? Or if your baking powder is old and not working well? Wish I could give you a more definitive answer.</p>

      <p>Hey you beautiful human!<br />
I have just baked this deliciousness and feel so sad that I have lived to the age of almost 30, unhappily unaware of such a delightful thing.<br />
I used the exact recipe but added some vanilla extract just because I can.  It is still an amazing recipe sans vanilla extract. Hail to the French people, hail to Orangette!<br />
I&#8217;d better get back to devouring that cake.<br />

      <p>Thanks for this recipe.  I made it with two thirds almond meal and the rest flour.  It had a chewiness, and I think I would prefer more tenderness, no almond meal next time.</p>
<p>I also reduced the sugar by a quarter and it was sweet enough for us.</p>
<p>I think the amount of oil can also be cut down by a quarter.</p>

      <p>Thank you for my go-to cake recipe &#8211; I&#8217;ve made this dozens of times across 5 countries since I found your blog in 2009. I finally found a la fermiere yoghurt pot in a second-hand shop a few weeks ago (having lost all of my others in house moves) so am happily making this cake again &#8211; this time with raspberries and blue berries, poppyseeds and brandy. 🙂</p>

      <p>Hi from the UK.</p>
<p>I know this recipe is over 10 years old but jus wanted to leave a comment to say, I made this cake for the first time ever last week and it looked amazing (like I had bought it in a shop, one friend commented). Have made it again today and it has turned out equally amazingly!  It&#8217;s going in my book of best recipes ever. Thank you so much for sharing.</p>

      <p>Hi Molly<br />
I came to your site for a regular check up and to retrieve this recipe. Hi! And also, this recipe isn&#8217;t appearing in your new recipe index. Various combinations of &#8216;French&#8217;, &#8216;yoghurt&#8217; and &#8216;cake&#8217; failed to produce it. Eventually I did find it using Google&#8217;s search engine rather than your own&#8230; I would hate for other readers to experience the deep distress I went through when I thought this recipe was gone, so I wanted to let you know. (It just occurred to me that it could be my Australian spelling of &#8216;yoghurt&#8217; that caused the problem, but a search function should know better). </p>
<p>Thank you for this recipe. I&#8217;ve collected 6 La Fermiere jars specifically so that I can make it. As only one is needed for cooking, I drink whisky out of the rest of them. Ergo, this cake has brought joy into my life in so many different ways, not the least of which is La Fermiere vanilla yoghurt. xox</p>

      <p>This cake is so insanely delicious, I barely got it cool before I cut it and ate a quarter of the cake! I only reduced the sugar a little and put some walnuts in. I had never made this cake before, but now it is my favorite. The lemon zest and yogurt go so great together, what a delight. Box mix tastes dead compared to this. Thank you for this recipe!</p>

      <p>This cake has become a favorite.  I like that I can make many variations .  The variation using ground almonds is a particular favorite.  Last night I really switched things up.  I used the ground almonds, orange zest, melted butter instead of oil (from Laura Calder) and brown sugar instead of granulated sugar.  I made an orange syrup to pour over the cake.  It&#8217;s delicious!</p>
